2016-02-25 11:44:07	Ferus	yes, a userscript for that exists
2016-02-25 11:45:49	fs0ciety	where can i find user submitted userscripts? :)
2016-02-25 11:46:31	Ferus	fs0ciety: I can't find it on github. I feel like The-Compiler has linked it here before so I'd suggest asking him where he's hiding it :)
2016-02-25 11:47:51	fs0ciety	thanks :)
2016-02-25 11:50:31	Ferus	fs0ciety: i found it https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/pull/873/files
2016-02-25 11:50:46	Ferus	<3 weechat relay servers + regex buffer searching
2016-02-25 11:52:09	Ferus	this script is much better than the one i wrote to use pass...
2016-02-25 11:54:04	fs0ciety	ahh thank you

2016-02-25 19:43:29	xpt	The-Compiler: I can confirm that the issue I had yesterday was asciidoc related.
2016-02-25 19:44:18	xpt	.oO(well at least the one with qutebrowser. The one on production was related to network guys that gave me second sleepless night in a row...)
2016-02-25 19:44:29	xpt	Thanks for help solving that.

2016-02-25 20:09:05	xpt	my computer hates me... now I can't add qutebrowser as default browser in gnome (it is added but gnome spawns firefox instead...)
2016-02-25 20:09:41	xpt	oh, I forgot to add qutebrowser to /usr/local/bin/
2016-02-25 20:13:29	The-Compiler	there's a qutebrowser package in Fedora very soon btw, I think they still need testers?

2016-02-25 20:22:12	e2k	(just had to vent)
2016-02-25 20:22:35	xpt	I'll be more than happy to help with tests.
2016-02-25 20:22:53	mearon	hey
2016-02-25 20:23:31	mearon	may I ask... are there any plans on moving to QtWebEngine in the foreseeable future?
2016-02-25 20:25:57	wasamasa	see ticket 666
2016-02-25 20:26:42	mearon	wasamasa: thanks, I'll check it out.

2016-02-25 20:34:02	The-Compiler	mearon: plans yes, but it's a big undertaking
2016-02-25 20:34:27	mearon	The-Compiler: yeah I thought so...
2016-02-25 20:34:32	The-Compiler	mearon: and I'll probably end up not supporting QtWebEngine with Qt < 5.6 or maybe even 5.7
2016-02-25 20:34:41	The-Compiler	because there's just too much missing
2016-02-25 20:34:56	mearon	btw I just read this: https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/
2016-02-25 20:34:58	The-Compiler	(note both 5.6 and 5.7 aren't out yet :D)
2016-02-25 20:35:05	The-Compiler	yeah :-/
2016-02-25 20:36:07	mearon	so I looking for some (minimal) browser backend by QtWebEngine. qutebrowsing might be the first one of this kind.. :)
2016-02-25 20:36:20	mearon	thank you for the infos.
2016-02-25 20:36:34	The-Compiler	currently I'm still busy with getting everything tested - if you write Python, help with that would be very much appreciated!
2016-02-25 20:36:36	mearon	I wish I could contribute somehow, but I'm clearly not qualified.
2016-02-25 20:37:00	mearon	sorry :/
2016-02-25 20:37:04	The-Compiler	there's https://github.com/kovidgoyal/vise fwiw but I don't think it's intended for the general public
2016-02-25 20:37:45	The-Compiler	do you know HTML/CSS/JS? There's also some help I need with that regarding tests because I don't very well
2016-02-25 20:38:57	mearon	HTML/CSS basics yes, but JS not (yet)... kinda noob :)
2016-02-25 20:48:57	wasamasa	The-Compiler: oh dear, that's from the calibre author
