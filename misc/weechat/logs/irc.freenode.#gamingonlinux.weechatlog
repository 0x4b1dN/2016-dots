2016-01-21 12:47:56	fs0ciety	i should try it again, was on arch at the time. now on funtoo
2016-01-21 12:48:08	fs0ciety	ram isn't an issue here. 32gb of ram.. be good to actually use it

2016-01-21 12:57:33	stqn	haha you’ll break your install day one ;)

2016-01-21 13:00:00	fs0ciety	dreamtiki: You're best bet is to compile a new kernel with the default arch .config and adding the amd drivers under --> device drivers when you run sudo make menuconfig

2016-01-21 15:13:15	gnarface	i seem to be having this problem: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=639876
2016-01-21 15:13:26	gnarface	but it affects more than just keyboards on encrypted setups
2016-01-21 15:13:42	gnarface	it also affects if you're booting from usb or reiserfs (maybe just both?)
2016-01-21 15:14:57	gnarface	and the workaround of using modules=most instead of modules=dep isn't acceptable because it triples the already very slow boot time from cheap usb flash keys

2016-01-21 19:56:53	Ysblokje	so did the upstream guy
2016-01-21 19:57:26	Ysblokje	with mercurial I would just hg pull <otherrepourl>  and do some rebase or merge
2016-01-21 19:57:51	Ysblokje	What is the workflow with git for that?
2016-01-21 19:58:08	Ysblokje	I tried some examples from the net but I must be missing something
2016-01-21 19:58:29	Ysblokje	because none of it is showing up in my code
2016-01-21 19:58:33	bazukas	git pull upstream_remote branch
2016-01-21 20:00:33	bazukas	git remote add upstream_remote https://github.com/user/repo.git, if you don't have that remote added

2016-01-21 20:23:32	Ysblokje	I just needed to add the remote
2016-01-21 20:23:42	Ysblokje	I thought it would be automatic since it was a clone
2016-01-21 20:23:45	Ysblokje	silly me
2016-01-21 20:30:47	homerj	git gets goofy
2016-01-21 20:31:02	homerj	there's a method to the madness, but sometimes it's just "ok, what exactly do I need to do here"

2016-01-21 20:50:24	homerj	Ysblokje, there is a hg-git gateway for github, so you can use hg
2016-01-21 20:50:25	homerj	I've never TRIED it, but it's there

2016-01-21 20:55:13	homerj	segfault?
2016-01-21 20:55:17	Ysblokje	nope
2016-01-21 20:55:32	homerj	there a repo somewhere?
2016-01-21 20:56:01	Ysblokje	most the application works just fine. but it needs to respond to some commands, and I think it tries to but I see nothing being replied
2016-01-21 20:56:05	Ysblokje	not yet
2016-01-21 20:56:25	Ysblokje	Its ugly as hell code

2016-01-21 20:56:43	homerj	put it up somewhere, I'll have a look

2016-01-22 01:02:07	Mneuro	if you use Gallium Nine you have to have an AMD card right?

2016-01-22 01:02:36	FutureSuture	Mneuro, correct.
2016-01-22 01:03:06	Mneuro	Wouldn't that hinder native game performance though

2016-01-22 01:06:31	Mneuro	I really only do native gaming on linux
2016-01-22 01:06:44	Mneuro	I used to mess with wine, but it's just better to have a dual boot if you are going to play windows games
2016-01-22 01:06:47	FutureSuture	kon14, check the links. Gallium Nine might as well be AMD exclusive.
2016-01-22 01:06:51	EddDeDuck	Native gaming on Linux I’d always reccomend Nvidia
2016-01-22 01:07:19	kon14	FutureSuture: which one? the gol article?
2016-01-22 01:07:25	kon14	i just connected btw
2016-01-22 01:07:26	FutureSuture	kon14, both links.
2016-01-22 01:07:41	FutureSuture	Both were posted after you joined.
2016-01-22 01:08:32	kon14	i mean, are those related to gallium_nine not working on nouveau?
2016-01-22 01:08:46	FutureSuture	kon14, yea.
2016-01-22 01:08:53	FutureSuture	The benchmarks include Nouveau.
2016-01-22 01:09:05	kon14	nouveau is gallium driver isn't it?
2016-01-22 01:09:18	kon14	in the gallium architecture or whatever

2016-01-22 01:11:34	FutureSuture	I did
2016-01-22 01:11:38	kon14	and afaik it works on nouveau
2016-01-22 01:12:06	FutureSuture	In those benchmarks, it worked in 1 out of 5 benchmarks.

2016-01-22 01:13:51	FutureSuture	Holy poo is the performance bad in your links.

2016-01-22 01:14:36	kon14	there's a difference between something being exclusie to X and performanc/support being bad on Y
2016-01-22 01:14:47	FutureSuture	kon14, all I can say is that it worked 5 out of 5 times for AMD in those benchmarks, and 1 out of 5 times for Nouveau
2016-01-22 01:15:03	FutureSuture	kon14, that is why I said it might as well be exclusive.
2016-01-22 01:15:14	kon14	got it now
2016-01-22 01:15:36	kon14	should have read it anew before

2016-01-22 05:58:49	qptain_Nemo	well i mean, it really depends
2016-01-22 05:58:50	Bronsky	qptain_Nemo: I was also joking, but to be honest it's not a question of patience. When the next act takes that long I rather not play or I get lazy to start the new one
2016-01-22 05:59:01	Bronsky	so if I want to play the entire game I have to wait
2016-01-22 06:00:20	qptain_Nemo	you mean you lose the drive for playing it?
2016-01-22 06:01:51	Bronsky	something inside me knows that I will not play the entire game so I lost the appeal to play it until it's complete

2016-01-22 06:36:05	FutureSuture	calexil, I found it easier to learn than League of Legends
2016-01-22 06:36:05	calexil	counterstrike
2016-01-22 06:36:13	calexil	I mean its easy to learn
2016-01-22 06:36:16	FutureSuture	But yes, I've quit DOTA2, and multiplayer only games in general.
2016-01-22 06:36:17	calexil	but hard to master
2016-01-22 06:36:24	calexil	like chess
2016-01-22 06:36:38	FutureSuture	Left 4 Dead, as it turns out, isn't for me either, despite having a singleplayer mode.
2016-01-22 06:36:39	GermainZ	so is dota really
2016-01-22 06:36:46	FutureSuture	It's got no story.
2016-01-22 06:36:58	GermainZ	the only learning curve is "learn the key bindings"

2016-01-22 06:51:21	FutureSuture	But I digress.
2016-01-22 06:51:46	FutureSuture	SuperTuxKart and 0 A.D. will help with the multiplayer needs, but the former has no online multiplayer yet and the latter is too incomplete.
2016-01-22 06:52:13	FutureSuture	drumr, some do, some don't, but when a game is gratis, there is no barrier to entry, really.
2016-01-22 06:53:00	FutureSuture	I myself am not keen on spending money on multiplayer games again.

2016-01-22 06:55:51	@Samsai	could very well be that they packed their things and left for greener pastures and more populated games
2016-01-22 06:55:59	FutureSuture	Evolve seems to have flopped in terms of sales.

2016-01-22 06:56:41	@Samsai	initial sales were okay-ish, then the player base fell and the word about the game dying started spreading
2016-01-22 06:56:50	@Samsai	and when people assumed the game died, it died
2016-01-22 06:56:50	FutureSuture	Would Feral be able to just get up and leave? Surely they invested time and money into porting the game before release.
2016-01-22 06:56:50	GermainZ	then it died
2016-01-22 06:57:15	drumr	true
2016-01-22 06:57:31	@Samsai	FutureSuture, keep in mind the PR risk involved with releasing the port

2016-01-22 06:58:59	FutureSuture	It took DOTA2 to see the futility in multiplayer only games.
2016-01-22 06:59:03	FutureSuture	Another reason to only buy games with solid singleplayer campaigns. You don't need to rely on anyone else. <3

2016-01-22 08:23:54	FutureSuture	Also, NaughtySquid, I've been wondering. Aspyr and Feral are the publishers of their Linux and Mac OS ports, correct? Couldn't Aspyr and Feral bring their ports to GOG, even if the Windows clients are not there yet?
2016-01-22 08:24:16	qptain_Nemo	what an interesting point
2016-01-22 08:24:26	FutureSuture	qptain_Nemo, quite so.
2016-01-22 08:24:28	qptain_Nemo	i wouldn't be surprised if gog itself turned them down though :(
2016-01-22 08:24:44	FutureSuture	GOG can go FUDGE itself then.
2016-01-22 08:24:45	qptain_Nemo	cdpr/gog are still clearly very windows-centric
2016-01-22 08:24:51	FutureSuture	Apologies for the language.
2016-01-22 08:25:07	qptain_Nemo	wow, FutureSuture. so fucking rude.

2016-01-22 08:25:37	FutureSuture	Yea, every Linux user seems to think DRM free gaming and Linux/open source software go hand in hand. Only GOG seems to disagree.
2016-01-22 08:25:52	qptain_Nemo	but yeah, it's just my hypothetical assumption. maybe they wouldn't.
2016-01-22 08:26:09	toor_xunil	DRM free gaming and open source software?
2016-01-22 08:26:10	toor_xunil	nah
2016-01-22 08:26:14	drumr	maybe there needs to be a third player in the ports business
2016-01-22 08:26:17	toor_xunil	nobody thinks that
2016-01-22 08:26:35	drumr	i would be offering to port older stuff
2016-01-22 08:26:47	FutureSuture	toor_xunil, I cannot tell if that was sarcasm or not.
2016-01-22 08:26:52	qptain_Nemo	night dive studios port some of their stuff
2016-01-22 08:26:55	qptain_Nemo	iirc
2016-01-22 08:27:08	@NaughtySquid	it depends
2016-01-22 08:27:20	toor_xunil	FutureSuture, dude… if they do… that's weird… it really has nothing to do with open source the fact there is no DRM
2016-01-22 08:27:23	@NaughtySquid	on what gog require and what the original developer and publisher sign off on
2016-01-22 08:27:36	@NaughtySquid	aspyr/feral may only be getting the rights to publish on steam
2016-01-22 08:27:43	@NaughtySquid	a different store would be a different contract
2016-01-22 08:28:02	toor_xunil	it's like saying "freeware" are related to open source, because open source softwares are usually free
2016-01-22 08:28:31	FutureSuture	toor_xunil, I can try and find said people's arguments on GOG. Something about software freedom and what not; being able to do what you want with said software.
2016-01-22 08:28:51	drumr	meh
2016-01-22 08:28:58	drumr	oh you mean zealots
2016-01-22 08:29:38	qptain_Nemo	i wonder if steam lets you publish linux-exclusive games. does anyone know by any chance?
2016-01-22 08:30:24	vidje	why wouldn't they? Oo
2016-01-22 08:30:36	vidje	if you can publish windows exclusives, why couldn't you linux exclusives?
2016-01-22 08:31:31	FutureSuture	Ugh, can't find any significant statements on the matter now.
2016-01-22 08:31:55	drumr	so can you put a game up if your small and not go through greenlight?
2016-01-22 08:32:01	vidje	tbh don't think valve cares as long as they get their money
2016-01-22 08:32:15	drumr	i think if people would put out games linux exclusive for the first couple months you would get some interesting reactions
2016-01-22 08:32:18	FutureSuture	But yea, if anything, I associate DRM free more with Linux/open source software than DRM.
2016-01-22 08:32:26	drumr	lo yeah that was going to be my first reaction
2016-01-22 08:32:48	FutureSuture	You can't publish Linux only games. It's against Valve's TOS as far as I recall.
2016-01-22 08:33:17	qptain_Nemo	FutureSuture: i wish you had a source but thanks anyway
2016-01-22 08:33:22	vidje	discriminatory TOS then
2016-01-22 08:34:03	@NaughtySquid	there is a linux-only game on steam atm

2016-01-22 08:37:21	qptain_Nemo	> To remain in Steam Greenlight and qualify for distribution via Steam, your game must at least run on a Windows PC.
2016-01-22 08:38:10	qptain_Nemo	(i actually think crossplatforminess is a better tactic but this is still not very cool)
2016-01-22 08:38:46	vidje	but not all games need to be in greenlight, yes?
2016-01-22 08:39:04	qptain_Nemo	pretty much all games, yes
2016-01-22 08:39:11	vidje	hm ok
2016-01-22 08:39:11	FutureSuture	qptain_Nemo, oh, did you mean a source for one's game needing to have a Windows client?
2016-01-22 08:39:12	qptain_Nemo	unless you have a massive AAA publisher or won an award
2016-01-22 08:39:32	qptain_Nemo	FutureSuture: uh, sorry?
2016-01-22 08:39:50	qptain_Nemo	i just meant a windows release available in the steam store?
2016-01-22 08:40:07	FutureSuture	[21:32:47] <FutureSuture> You can't publish Linux only games. It's against Valve's TOS as far as I recall.
2016-01-22 08:40:07	FutureSuture	[21:33:17] <qptain_Nemo> FutureSuture: i wish you had a source but thanks anyway
2016-01-22 08:40:22	qptain_Nemo	ah yes
2016-01-22 08:40:46	FutureSuture	Gave you a source for the GOG claim when you could have meant the Steam claim.
2016-01-22 08:40:57	qptain_Nemo	yeah i meant steam, sorry if i was vague

2016-01-22 08:41:24	qptain_Nemo	but i pretty much found the steam one as you can see
2016-01-22 08:42:03	FutureSuture	Yea
2016-01-22 08:42:46	FutureSuture	So even if SteamOS takes off, every game will still need to have a Windows client.
2016-01-22 08:44:00	qptain_Nemo	seeing westwood titles on the gog wishlist makes me sad
2016-01-22 08:44:13	qptain_Nemo	giving more money to EA who shut down westwood :(
2016-01-22 08:44:34	FutureSuture	I guess I'll make you sad as well, qptain_Nemo. Which games did Westwood do?
2016-01-22 08:45:30	qptain_Nemo	they're most famous for their strategy series Dune and Command and Conquer, Red Alert in particular. but they also did some other interesting stuff such as adventure games Circuit's Edge, Legend of Kyrandia, Blade Runner and action RPG series Lands of Lore
2016-01-22 08:46:27	qptain_Nemo	i'm super biased but i almost see Lands of Lore 2 as the witcher of its time. it was really damn cool

2016-01-24 13:26:04	tadzik	from what I understand from his, quoting "goofy ass shit" and "funky ass macro", the function he calls is a macro that generates multiple functions
2016-01-24 13:26:40	Smilex	Oh yeah. I do the same. Basically you define the function signature once, then call the function macro to sync that signature across files

2016-01-24 13:30:21	tadzik	huh
2016-01-24 13:31:11	Smilex	the benefit is that I need the function signature can be reused both for declaring a function, and for function pointers
2016-01-24 13:32:13	tadzik	fair enough
2016-01-24 13:32:23	tadzik	I've never seen this trick before, interesting

2016-01-24 13:48:03	tadzik	so, there was a lot of hype about how "now we can write once and it runs everywhere, no platform specific stuff"
2016-01-24 13:48:33	tadzik	so people say that during their presentation, then 20 slides later they say "well, eventually we had to abandon the iOS port because of the incompatibilities and had to settle for just android"
2016-01-24 13:48:49	tadzik	and at the end again: "we're happy to choose html5 because of the portability, bla bla bla"

2016-01-24 13:50:32	tadzik	now that I think of it, it's hardly related :)
2016-01-24 13:50:58	tadzik	but it amuses me inside every time a cross platform stuff gets brought up
2016-01-24 13:51:55	tadzik	as for C (or Seeples), I don't even have hope
2016-01-24 13:54:46	Smilex	Yeah. I got burnt quite badly by the HTML5 portability promise

2016-02-07 08:02:37	@NaughtySquid	it's a fucking useless benchmark
2016-02-07 08:02:41	@NaughtySquid	if he did it on low/medium
2016-02-07 08:02:49	@NaughtySquid	and one on 720p too
2016-02-07 08:02:53	@NaughtySquid	now that would be useful

2016-02-07 08:10:02	@Samsai	but nobody in their right mind will play on ultra with a 710

2016-02-07 08:17:51	Half-Shot	TL;DR anything less than the 60's from Nvidia is worthless because current gen IGPUs are about as powerful as the lesser cards if you configure it right

2016-02-07 08:25:56	mirv_	also, good evening
2016-02-07 08:26:13	Raven67854	mirv_, Yeah for zen APU's. AMD is currently testing and some might make it this year to see if its worthwhile
2016-02-07 08:26:20	Raven67854	Dedicated HBM for the APU
2016-02-07 08:26:50	@Samsai	that would make sense
2016-02-07 08:27:00	Raven67854	Yeah
2016-02-07 08:27:13	Raven67854	But costs can be an issue also you need space on the mobo for it
2016-02-07 08:27:16	@Samsai	some games get bogged down by the RAM speed and you don't necessarily want to buy gamer grade RAM straight from AMD
2016-02-07 08:27:33	Raven67854	Skylakes are DDR4 and AMD zen will be ddr4
2016-02-07 08:27:41	Raven67854	So ram speed should be less and less of an issue

2016-02-07 08:33:17	drumr	well it did use amd again for quite a while
2016-02-07 08:33:23	@Samsai	it barely works with ubuntu
2016-02-07 08:33:41	mirv_	mesa, on the other hand, just works with everything
2016-02-07 08:33:42	drumr	i was always mad because i had amd and all my friends nvidia was so much better with performance
2016-02-07 08:33:54	drumr	im talking 98-2005
2016-02-07 08:34:17	Smilex	drumr: you were always mad for 7 years?
2016-02-07 08:34:18	depingus	Hopefully amdgpu helps.
2016-02-07 08:34:30	mirv_	I think we're at the point where most people should be using mesa over fglrx
2016-02-07 08:34:39	drumr	no im talking about the gpus i had
2016-02-07 08:34:40	@Samsai	depingus, can't be worse so it likely does
2016-02-07 08:34:45	Smilex	drumr: I'm kidding
2016-02-07 08:34:46	drumr	it didnt game all that often
2016-02-07 08:34:56	drumr	it was always andissue when i did and back then it wasnt the cost
2016-02-07 08:35:06	@Samsai	mirv_, based on GOL's surveys most AMD users do
2016-02-07 08:35:15	depingus	i was on mesa but XCOM2 was having a terrible time. fglrx helped some. SOME. XC2 is still a mess of a game.
2016-02-07 08:35:15	drumr	i know but man was it annoying
2016-02-07 08:35:29	GermainZ	vidje: why are you asking me?
2016-02-07 08:35:43	@Samsai	at least feral is sorting out the AMD issues
2016-02-07 08:35:57	@Samsai	hopefully we'll see a performance patch soon
2016-02-07 08:35:59	Smilex	So The Revenant is basically Bear Grylls
2016-02-07 08:36:04	Smilex	basically about *
2016-02-07 08:36:17	depingus	That's what I heard. I know its opening weekend. So I'm holding off. Do you know if the AMD patch is for fglrx or for mesa?
2016-02-07 08:36:26	mirv_	Samsai, I like how there are reports of XCOM2 running better under Linux
2016-02-07 08:36:44	@Samsai	mirv_, i don't think it runs better on linux anymore
2016-02-07 08:36:57	@Samsai	i think the windows version already got a patch that helps a bit
2016-02-07 08:36:59	vidje	GermainZ, i saw your name is on that github

2016-02-07 08:37:12	@Samsai	depingus, feral is working quite closely with the mesa drivers
2016-02-07 08:37:12	depingus	ive played the first 2 missions. its playable.
2016-02-07 08:37:25	mirv_	btw, where is FutureSuture when you need him?
2016-02-07 08:37:35	@Samsai	depingus, with grid we saw them prioritize mesa over crimson
2016-02-07 08:37:37	vidje	GermainZ, your name is on the readme.md stating it's a collection if scripts among which you've coded some yourself
2016-02-07 08:37:56	depingus	i heard the mesa drivers might work better in XC2. hopefully this is the case.
2016-02-07 08:38:04	GermainZ	vidje: correct. Now read what you've just said again, and explain to me how that makes me the person to ask for support with any script in the repo?
2016-02-07 08:38:15	vidje	i asked if you know
2016-02-07 08:38:23	@Samsai	depingus, at the moment there's a marginal visual improvement if you use mesa
2016-02-07 08:38:30	vidje	as it could've well been your script in there
2016-02-07 08:38:32	@Samsai	performance is slightly worse though
2016-02-07 08:38:34	hidekin	i tried xcom 2 on linux and windows , on linux i'm on medium at 40fps , on windows i'm on high at 50fps with a gtx 770. I hope they patch the game

2016-02-07 08:39:12	vidje	ye np it's not working for some reason anyway
2016-02-07 08:39:26	GermainZ	vidje: hexchat has an IRC channel, maybe try that
2016-02-07 08:39:45	depingus	mine was unplayable in mesa. Dropping to 1 FPS during action mode. With catalyst i only drop to like 15.
2016-02-07 08:39:59	vidje	ye did long time ago, no worries, fixing it
2016-02-07 08:40:14	@Samsai	depingus, it starts out absolutely terrible
2016-02-07 08:40:29	GermainZ	then it becomes just terrible \o/
2016-02-07 08:40:33	@Samsai	but over time the performance starts to level down
2016-02-07 08:41:08	depingus	Hope a patch comes soon. I took monday off (post superbowl hangover) so maybe i get lucky! Would be nice to spend a day off playing XC.
2016-02-07 08:41:08	@Samsai	the game definitely wasn't great on mesa though

2016-02-07 08:57:10	drumr	still decent

2016-02-07 08:57:52	Ysblokje	RTS offering along those lines has been pretty slim

2016-02-08 21:52:29	EddDeDuck	That betting in tennis news story
2016-02-08 21:52:49	EddDeDuck	which turned out to be way less sensational when you looked at the actual facts

2016-02-08 21:56:22	FutureSuture	Then that article about Steam Machines sucking came out
2016-02-08 21:56:24	Half-Shot	I used to think they were acceptable
2016-02-08 21:56:34	Half-Shot	Yeah, that changed my opinion

2016-02-08 21:57:21	Half-Shot	Cause you can't technically fault it, Windows would have been alright with that monitor
2016-02-08 21:57:29	Half-Shot	It's just...stupid
2016-02-08 21:58:00	Half-Shot	I always maintain the Steam Machines are just a console running Linux, as a product.
2016-02-08 21:58:14	Half-Shot	So don't expect it to do non console things, just be pleased when it can.
2016-02-08 21:59:45	Half-Shot	I'd like them to take off, just so we can have a return of homebrew software.
2016-02-08 22:00:17	EddDeDuck	How will a Steam box help with homebrew?
2016-02-08 22:00:34	Half-Shot	Potential for custom skins, mods to the system.
2016-02-08 22:01:03	EddDeDuck	I can’t see how that will be more likely with SteamOS on a Steam machine in a living room.
2016-02-08 22:01:33	Half-Shot	Oh extremely. Same way that android has allowed us to put whatever on our phones.
2016-02-08 22:01:35	EddDeDuck	People who want homebrew usually don’t fit into the console market.
2016-02-08 22:02:10	FutureSuture	What I like about Steam Machines is that there now is more hardware that one can buy with Linux preinstalled. Bought myself a Steam Machine just to install Antergos on it and managed to count as a Linux sale.
2016-02-08 22:02:12	EddDeDuck	Same thing with Android vast % of Android users who have anything custom outside of the options built in in very small.
2016-02-08 22:02:27	Half-Shot	Yeah, it's not a majority thing.
2016-02-08 22:02:33	Half-Shot	But the option is there
2016-02-08 22:02:55	EddDeDuck	Sure it might be the hackable console
2016-02-08 22:03:18	EddDeDuck	but I don’t thnk it’s adding much more over Linux/Mac/WIndows in that regard
2016-02-08 22:03:45	Half-Shot	It's really the same thing as when I got Linux running on my PS2. The thing was old and obviously many times slower than my PC. But it was cool in it's own way.

2016-02-08 23:13:23	homerj	but I think that would be useful, I'm sure all over the world, a lot of people like their home radio commentary over the tv commentary
2016-02-08 23:13:59	homerj	especially when your game is national, and you get the network's "b-team" and you just want your own people calling the game

2016-02-08 23:32:35	xpander69	XCOM2 multiplayer seems pretty bad .. i mean delay between turns is just insane.. the longer you play the longer the delay
2016-02-08 23:32:51	xpander69	like i saw action on scree and my friend saw it like 30-40 sec later..and vice versa
2016-02-08 23:33:24	EddDeDuck	Yep seen that usually it’s when one machine is lagging hard or internet conx isn’t great
2016-02-08 23:33:33	EddDeDuck	We’ve reproduced with all three platforms

2016-02-09 01:42:10	Raven67854	Stop being broke
2016-02-09 01:42:14	DrMcCoy	I'm currently glad I can somewhat feed myself
2016-02-09 01:42:24	@NaughtySquid	Smilex: it would be a good idea to blast all the dust off your PSU and GPU fans
2016-02-09 01:42:26	@NaughtySquid	as well as case fans
2016-02-09 01:42:29	Raven67854	I'll stop by there today or tomorrow DrMcCoy..
2016-02-09 01:42:32	Raven67854	What GPU do you have?
2016-02-09 01:42:49	DrMcCoy	GeForce GT 630

2016-02-09 01:43:14	DrMcCoy	Well
2016-02-09 01:43:18	DrMcCoy	It's newer than my CPU
2016-02-09 01:43:23	Raven67854	That is true
2016-02-09 01:43:42	DrMcCoy	Which is an Athlon 64 X2, 6000+. Built in 2006, I believe
2016-02-09 01:43:51	Raven67854	The PC i'll be ripping that ram out of has a AMD Athlon 64 x2 6500+ black edition
2016-02-09 01:44:02	Raven67854	I loved that machine
2016-02-09 01:44:09	Raven67854	I played so much left 4 dead on it
2016-02-09 01:45:57	DrMcCoy	If you want to gift me a whole new desktop, I certainly wouldn't complain ;)
2016-02-09 01:47:00	FutureSuture	Someday, DrMcCoy. Someday.
2016-02-09 01:47:47	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, I am not that nice no :P
2016-02-09 01:49:38	FutureSuture	DrMcCoy, mirv_ has gifted NaughtySquid quite a few bits of hardware I believe.
2016-02-09 01:50:02	@Samsai	FutureSuture, don't sell other people's gifts
2016-02-09 01:50:31	DrMcCoy	Yeah, this is getting weird
2016-02-09 01:50:49	Raven67854	I bought my own hardware
2016-02-09 01:50:49	Raven67854	:P
2016-02-09 01:51:16	DrMcCoy	How square
2016-02-09 01:51:22	Raven67854	I know right!
2016-02-09 01:51:31	@Samsai	i had two old rigs but we sent both to a recycling center
2016-02-09 01:51:42	@Samsai	they were probably too crappy to be of any use anyway
2016-02-09 01:51:49	Raven67854	I have a hard time recycling hardware
2016-02-09 01:51:52	Raven67854	I just keep it :(
2016-02-09 01:51:58	Raven67854	I'm like maybe I'll need it someday!
2016-02-09 01:52:13	@Samsai	we just kinda dropped it off at the recycling center, they'll figure out what they can do with it
2016-02-09 01:52:15	Raven67854	Then people just give you that look. When will you need a 386 machine. YOU NEVER KNOW

2016-02-09 01:52:26	DrMcCoy	I recently threw away a system with a 486. The PSU was shot, though
2016-02-09 01:52:56	DrMcCoy	Still hurt like hell, throwing it away
2016-02-09 01:53:02	Raven67854	There there

2016-02-09 01:54:19	Raven67854	DrMcCoy, ha!
2016-02-09 01:54:23	Smilex	DrMcCoy: Oh you know about that
2016-02-09 01:54:57	DrMcCoy	The scary thing is that it makes sense. If you ignore the weird terminology

2016-02-09 02:05:55	linux_gamer	why is the delay so big?
2016-02-09 02:06:06	xpander69	linux_gamer, probably because of wifi?
2016-02-09 02:06:12	xpander69	didnt test usb tethering
2016-02-09 02:06:40	linux_gamer	mh, ok but it should be ~100ms or?
2016-02-09 02:06:52	xpander69	yeah..might be even bit more
2016-02-09 02:06:55	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, that might be fun
2016-02-09 02:07:10	linux_gamer	but a very cool idea
2016-02-09 02:07:17	xpander69	linux_gamer, someone somewhere said that enabling plane mode on phone will help to reduce lag
2016-02-09 02:07:22	xpander69	havent tried that either yet
2016-02-09 02:08:05	linux_gamer	interesting use of the gyro anyway
2016-02-09 02:08:11	@NaughtySquid	so
2016-02-09 02:08:17	xpander69	now i wonder if you can do same with steam controller :D
2016-02-09 02:08:19	@NaughtySquid	dying light enhanced edition & the following tomorrow
2016-02-09 02:08:23	xpander69	mounting it on top of your head :D
2016-02-09 02:08:26	linux_gamer	first thought it was optical
2016-02-09 02:09:12	linux_gamer	xpander69, were you able to config the steam controllers gyro for Grid?
2016-02-09 02:09:37	xpander69	linux_gamer, no idea..havent used..i feel that the steam controller has also some lag with gyro..wouldnt work in grid for me :D
2016-02-09 02:10:08	linux_gamer	im doing RR3 with the android gyro on my LG and its really nike
2016-02-09 02:10:11	Raven67854	Should be interesting to see if any Linux fixes are made :p
2016-02-09 02:11:05	xpander69	linux_gamer, no idea what RR3 is :)
2016-02-09 02:11:28	linux_gamer	its real racing 3, to bad its android and mac
2016-02-09 02:12:06	xpander69	linux_gamer, works with chrome also?
2016-02-09 02:12:10	xpander69	or need android really?
2016-02-09 02:12:31	linux_gamer	mh never tested anything but android

2016-02-09 02:16:48	linux_gamer	makes sense, but maybe shorten that a bit

2016-02-09 03:03:45	xpander69	itsa amazing!
2016-02-09 03:04:02	Smilex	xpander69: oh hello there Mario.
2016-02-09 03:04:05	xpander69	except the few framerate issue and multiplayer delay issues .D
2016-02-09 03:04:17	xpander69	Smilex, Mario? :D what
2016-02-09 03:04:58	Smilex	xpander69: _itsa_ me Mario.
2016-02-09 03:05:27	EddDeDuck	xpander69 you tried our beta update yet?
2016-02-09 03:05:35	xpander69	EddDeDuck, yes
2016-02-09 03:05:42	EddDeDuck	(y)
2016-02-09 03:06:00	xpander69	i think i reported back to you also that its smoother :)
2016-02-09 03:06:09	Huckert	I'm loving the game, despite how much the game seems to hate me. :(
2016-02-09 03:06:21	Half-Shot	Any point in mesa users trying the beta EddDeDuck? I'm not going to start it until I've completed XCOM, but good to know in advance.
2016-02-09 03:06:45	EddDeDuck	yeah mesa is pretty much shippable on AMD and Intel
2016-02-09 03:07:01	Half-Shot	I've started the game :P, ran better than expected.
2016-02-09 03:07:03	EddDeDuck	a few performance drops (which are mostly fixed in latets beta)
2016-02-09 03:07:32	EddDeDuck	We moved a few buffer calls for Mesa as it is slow using the standard method we use with other drivers
2016-02-09 03:07:41	EddDeDuck	It also imroves crimson
2016-02-09 03:07:50	EddDeDuck	which is also pretty good shape now
2016-02-09 03:08:42	EddDeDuck	Not supported (yet)
2016-02-09 03:08:55	xpander69	soon™
2016-02-09 03:09:13	EddDeDuck	How soon I don’t want to guess but we’re working on it
2016-02-09 03:10:05	Half-Shot	It's cool. I'm glad you're testing mesa :)
2016-02-09 03:10:52	Raven67854	Beta update is the only way to play xcom2
2016-02-09 03:10:59	Raven67854	Impossible to play without the beta. To much stuttering
2016-02-09 03:11:38	Raven67854	Good game though not sure how I feel about the turn timers on hard modes
2016-02-09 03:13:45	Raven67854	I like that they tried something to fix the camping overwatch sillyness. But the turn timers for every bit just seems like a meh way to go about it
2016-02-09 03:14:26	Huckert	Seeing as the "tables are turned" for this game there needs to be something to urge you forward imo
2016-02-09 03:14:51	Raven67854	Huckert, Have you played it ?
2016-02-09 03:15:07	Huckert	I have, and I am.
2016-02-09 03:15:18	Raven67854	some of the late missions are just a gigantic wtf on hard
2016-02-09 03:16:03	Huckert	Yeah :D
2016-02-09 03:16:29	Raven67854	Like not enough turns to get back after completion. Creates more frustration than it should. But eh overall it's a good game
2016-02-09 03:17:01	Huckert	Feels soooo good when you barely scrape through it though
2016-02-09 03:18:34	Huckert	Also starting to feel a lot better when I've played it a bit and I know what all the different things do

2016-02-09 03:28:36	xpander69	anonkun, ARK has a lot more content but is not a really good port performance wise.. Rust runs pretty good but less content and can break from time to time on the road for linux
2016-02-09 03:29:14	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:29:38	anonkun	well, can you recommend me some good games for linux? preferably online
2016-02-09 03:29:40	xpander69	so if you have GPU thats below x60 on nvidia side..just forget ARK
2016-02-09 03:29:49	anonkun	I havet a 750gtx ti
2016-02-09 03:29:51	xpander69	you also at least need 8GB memory for ARK
2016-02-09 03:29:56	anonkun	I do have 8GB ram
2016-02-09 03:30:02	xpander69	anonkun, then ARK wont be a smooth experience for you
2016-02-09 03:30:09	anonkun	hmm alright
2016-02-09 03:30:17	anonkun	I guess I wont get rust though
2016-02-09 03:30:26	xpander69	they want to add Vulkan as soon as UE4 becomes available with it..so that might help
2016-02-09 03:30:33	xpander69	but atm its pretty heavy on resources
2016-02-09 03:30:48	anonkun	well, then i'd rather buy it once its out with vulkan :)

2016-02-09 03:37:42	anonkun	or is it linux users vs linux users only
2016-02-09 03:37:45	anonkun	awesome
2016-02-09 03:37:57	anonkun	I hate CoH for keeping it linux vs linux only

2016-02-09 03:39:19	ezwdna	not so soon ...
2016-02-09 03:39:26	EddDeDuck	It’s not being “kept” Linux vs Linux
2016-02-09 03:39:36	EddDeDuck	It’s due to how the game is designed
2016-02-09 03:39:48	anonkun	I thought it was because they didn't make a native port or something
2016-02-09 03:40:02	EddDeDuck	nope it’s a native port
2016-02-09 03:40:05	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:40:08	anonkun	my bad then
2016-02-09 03:40:22	EddDeDuck	Our latest update expanded support to Mac vs Linux (the two platforms we develop on)
2016-02-09 03:40:53	anonkun	I loved the first CoH a lot
2016-02-09 03:40:55	anonkun	so got the second one
2016-02-09 03:41:00	anonkun	but didnt play much of it because of time etc
2016-02-09 03:41:16	anonkun	and also because I was unable to play with my friend, who uses windows
2016-02-09 03:41:28	xpander69	anonkun, linux is free:D
2016-02-09 03:41:29	anonkun	do you guys plan to keep the next iteration of CoH, if any, cross platform
2016-02-09 03:42:31	anonkun	xpander69: yeah, but my friend doesn't know how to use it and isn' willing. Plus it'll just cause him more trouble with partitioning etc.
2016-02-09 03:43:00	xpander69	you go and do it... buy him a cheap ssd for b-day ..install linux onto it :D
2016-02-09 03:43:12	anonkun	"cheap ssd" :PPP
2016-02-09 03:43:19	xpander69	ofc cheap
2016-02-09 03:43:27	anonkun	It's quite expensive where I live
2016-02-09 03:43:34	xpander69	cause if you buy expensive one..you will end up putting it into your machine :D
2016-02-09 03:43:39	xpander69	ahh ok :D
2016-02-09 03:43:56	anonkun	I plan on buying an SSD for myself first, eventually.
2016-02-09 03:44:00	anonkun	but i like your idea
2016-02-09 03:44:10	anonkun	buy a extra hard disk and gift it with linux
2016-02-09 03:44:35	anonkun	I could literally install it on my pc, then just plug the hard disk into friends pc ;P

2016-02-09 03:46:10	EddDeDuck	Yeah well we enabled Mac vs Linux but that was not simple (required replacement and debuging of a lot of stuff)
2016-02-09 03:47:19	anonkun	Well, thanks for the effort
2016-02-09 03:47:33	anonkun	but I get it, no one was expecting steamplay to be a thing
2016-02-09 03:48:10	EddDeDuck	Windows is possible but that would need WIndows side edits to enable all the chnages we did and debug any Windows specific things.
2016-02-09 03:48:40	EddDeDuck	It was a mutliple month task to get Mac vs Linux working so it’s not a make a few changes and compile thing :(
2016-02-09 03:48:50	anonkun	ah
2016-02-09 03:48:58	EddDeDuck	That said XCOM 2 and GRID Autosport are examples of cross platform MP
2016-02-09 03:49:00	anonkun	so you guys working on the windows edits?
2016-02-09 03:49:13	anonkun	or is it too much effort for the results
2016-02-09 03:49:16	frankyboy_	anonkun, but 16gb ssd for os... and use harddrive for other stuff

2016-02-09 03:49:53	EddDeDuck	Nope you missed that we added Mac vs Linux support on CoH2
2016-02-09 03:49:54	anonkun	do you want a battle to be going on here?
2016-02-09 03:49:57	EddDeDuck	so it’s not per platform
2016-02-09 03:50:07	Smilex	Oh, cross platform multiplayer
2016-02-09 03:50:10	Smilex	that's cool!
2016-02-09 03:50:13	EddDeDuck	Windows is now the odd one out that doesn’t support cross platform

2016-02-09 05:32:45	anonkun	what is SC2?
2016-02-09 05:32:58	vidje	starcraft2
2016-02-09 05:33:04	anonkun	its on linux ? o.O
2016-02-09 05:33:04	vidje	NaughtySquid, ah i see
2016-02-09 05:33:15	vidje	anonkun, no no
2016-02-09 05:33:21	anonkun	aaah
2016-02-09 05:33:38	anonkun	I remember blizzard talking about porting "at least on major title" to linux
2016-02-09 05:33:40	anonkun	odd they havent
2016-02-09 05:33:45	@NaughtySquid	they never said that
2016-02-09 05:33:49	gnarface	anonkun: their stuff is all playable in wine though
2016-02-09 05:33:51	@NaughtySquid	that was Phoronix bollacks as usual
2016-02-09 05:33:53	Half-Shot	As a rule, I don't like showing my face unless it adds to the video. Jim Sterling does kinda have a huge dramatics thing going on.
2016-02-09 05:33:55	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, no need to admit anything
2016-02-09 05:33:59	@Samsai	it's so blatantly obvious

2016-02-09 08:20:46	gnarface	guest01348: wow runs *alright* if you've got a specially-patched up wine and a good enough cpu
2016-02-09 08:20:48	disharmonic	gnarface: I stopped actively reading slashdot several years ago
2016-02-09 08:21:13	guest01348	already tried wow heh
2016-02-09 08:21:28	gnarface	guest01348: its runs pretty crappy unless you have the CSMT patch from staging
2016-02-09 08:21:50	gnarface	guest01348: could be more trouble than its worth
2016-02-09 08:22:07	gnarface	guest01348: Shadowrun: Boston Lockdown is technically an MMO
2016-02-09 08:22:16	gnarface	guest01348: no wine required
2016-02-09 08:22:33	guest01348	sorry for my ignorance but what is "CSMT patch" tbh the only way i've used wine is thru playonlinux
2016-02-09 08:23:20	guest01348	technically?
2016-02-09 08:23:25	gnarface	guest01348: its an experimental patch you can only get if you build wine yourself from scratch, it fixes the problem where WoW doesn't use more than about 30% of your total CPU cores total power
2016-02-09 08:23:49	turol	guest01348: technically: it moves some opengl processing to another thread
2016-02-09 08:23:54	turol	which might or might not make it faster
2016-02-09 08:23:55	guest01348	i tried neverwinter online with playonlinux and almost meted my cpu lol
2016-02-09 08:24:02	guest01348	using 100% of it heh
2016-02-09 08:24:22	guest01348	melted*
2016-02-09 08:24:23	disharmonic	gnarface: Actually POL ships wine binaries with CSMT
2016-02-09 08:24:32	gnarface	disharmonic: oh? didn't know that
2016-02-09 08:24:43	gnarface	guest01348: maybe you can get playonlinux to do it; check their info for CSMT
2016-02-09 08:25:12	guest01348	will do
2016-02-09 08:25:52	guest01348	How can I use the CSMT patch with POL?  Up until recently, you would have needed to request a patched WineBuild. Now, with the help of the devs at wine-staging, we have WineBuilds with the patchset from wine-staging, which happen to contain the CSMT patch (for now; when patches from wine-staging get mainlined, they are dropped from the -staging versions of Wine, as they are now a default feature.).  Simply go to Manage Win
2016-02-09 08:25:59	guest01348	pretty much :P
2016-02-09 08:26:52	guest01348	oh and i always thought shadowrun was like some sort of futuristic baldurs gate were you used more than 1 char
2016-02-09 08:27:36	gnarface	guest01348: well, that's actually a good description of it.  the "Boston Lockdown" one has multiplayer too though
2016-02-09 08:27:48	guest01348	i se
2016-02-09 08:27:50	guest01348	see*
2016-02-09 08:28:30	guest01348	i see what you meant when you said "sort of an mmo"
2016-02-09 08:29:20	gnarface	well its first of all turn-based, and second of all it lacks the kind of "massive" feel that games like WoW have; it doesn't really have a giant open world to wander around in.  the multiplayer features feel kinda bolted on
2016-02-09 08:29:53	gnarface	you have a massively multiplayer *chat* but outside of ad-hoc mission groupings there is very little multiplayer interactions

2016-02-09 08:30:22	guest01348	aye
2016-02-09 08:30:31	gnarface	but calling it an MMO in the same context as World of Warcraft seems inaccurate to me
2016-02-09 08:30:36	guest01348	defo added to my list now that you have mentioned it
2016-02-09 08:30:37	guest01348	:D
2016-02-09 08:30:58	guest01348	some mmos are very instance based tbh so it was a close call
2016-02-09 08:31:06	gnarface	yea its very instance based like that
2016-02-09 08:31:06	guest01348	non the less
2016-02-09 08:31:17	gnarface	it reminds me a lot of Phantasy Star Online 1&2
2016-02-09 08:31:23	gnarface	in the way multiplayer is
2016-02-09 08:31:33	gnarface	very instance-centric

2016-02-09 08:32:15	gnarface	they didn't keep it online very long though

2016-02-09 08:32:45	gnarface	one nice thing about "Shadowrun: Boston Lockdown" however compared to wow and phantasy star is there's no monthy charge

2016-02-09 08:43:25	stqn	hm now that I think of it, I have wine staging. But I don’t think I enabled csmt.
2016-02-09 08:43:44	gnarface	stqn: needing the latest i7 to crack 30fps in a crowded area isn't what i consider "well"
2016-02-09 08:44:19	disharmonic	I think i'
2016-02-09 08:44:34	gnarface	stqn: especially since it used to run much better, and performance has degraded significantly with very little apparent visual enhancement every time they release a new expansion

2016-02-09 08:47:50	gnarface	stqn: i really need to get around to trying that CSMT patch.  i'm curious whether you actually have it or not.  i'm *not* using wine-staging at all yet
2016-02-09 08:47:53	stqn	I admit I recently only tried low pop areas
2016-02-09 08:48:07	gnarface	yea it runs great if you're in low-population areas, especially in the old world
2016-02-09 08:48:22	gnarface	or inside a building, or even in most instances/raids
2016-02-09 08:48:39	gnarface	unfortunately those are also the cases where performance matters the least too
2016-02-09 08:50:11	gnarface	and then there's some minor indignities with regards to the advanced graphical features that used to work right in wine, and were disabled for no other reason than that they changed the interfaces to dx11 from dx9
2016-02-09 08:52:27	gnarface	so yea, i wouldn't characterize it as running "well" merely "acceptable"

2016-02-09 08:59:16	gnarface	i'm also curious what percentage of your cpu cores are in use
2016-02-09 08:59:22	gnarface	mine top out at about 30% of each
2016-02-09 08:59:28	gnarface	though its evenly spread across them
2016-02-09 08:59:34	gnarface	i've been told CSMT should fix it
2016-02-09 08:59:56	gnarface	gpu load appears to be "trivial"
2016-02-09 09:01:08	gnarface	and actually the graphical settings affect my framerate floor almost not at all
2016-02-09 09:01:25	gnarface	as in, i can't get better performance putting everything on low
2016-02-09 09:01:37	gnarface	the bottleneck seems to be in the multi-threading

2016-02-09 09:16:57	gnarface	stqn: i gotta assume the framerate difference has to do with just having a much faster cpu

2016-02-09 09:21:39	gnarface	last i checked you need an older wine version to get past that

2016-02-09 09:47:04	gnarface	alright so you got like 15fps on me
2016-02-09 09:47:38	gnarface	probably cause your i7 is actually a lot faster than my ancient phenomII
2016-02-09 09:47:55	stqn	I suppose the i5 helps.

2016-02-09 09:48:02	gnarface	ah
2016-02-09 09:48:10	Half-Shot	It makes that much of a difference? Which Phenom gnarface ?

2016-02-09 09:55:33	gnarface	its bullshit that you can't do it

2016-02-09 09:57:01	gnarface	that probably is what they're afraid of
2016-02-09 09:57:22	gnarface	the problem is that's not a legal justification
2016-02-09 09:57:42	gnarface	so they lie in court and say its because they're afraid users won't be able to tell the difference
2016-02-09 09:57:50	stqn	uh, what?
2016-02-09 09:58:18	stqn	isn’t the server code proprietary and not distributed to anyone?
2016-02-09 09:58:30	gnarface	well sure but it can be reverse engineered from the client
2016-02-09 09:58:32	gnarface	and people have done it
2016-02-09 09:58:35	gnarface	successfully
2016-02-09 09:58:57	stqn	that’s surprising.
2016-02-09 09:59:26	gnarface	but as soon as their projects gain any level of popularity blizzard brings the legal hammer down claiming that new users might get confused and mistake one of these free server projects for the official one
2016-02-09 10:00:13	gnarface	nonetheless, the most popular free wow projects are largely centered around rolling back to the original pre-expansion vanilla ruleset
2016-02-09 10:00:25	gnarface	which i think is a perfectly justifiable use case
2016-02-09 10:01:42	gnarface	blizzard has been attacking 3rd party projects since way back in the warcraft2 days though
2016-02-09 10:01:51	gnarface	this is hardly new behavior for them
2016-02-09 10:02:32	stqn	CSMT does seem to improve things. Higher FPS, one CPU core used to 100%, and 80% GPU usage instead of 68 earlier.
2016-02-09 10:02:58	gnarface	yea, i gotta get around to making a build with it :-/ building wine on debian SUUUUCKS though

2016-02-09 10:33:33	Half-Shot	It shows it's inheritance, but it doesn't 'clone' it imo.
2016-02-09 10:33:56	gnarface	Half-Shot: well it looks like theyr'e trying to add story and character to TF2 a bit  "like if Pixar had made TF2" i hear people say a lot.  it could work... *shrug*
2016-02-09 10:34:03	Half-Shot	I WANT valve to take TF2 to competitive, but they are taking a god damn long while.
2016-02-09 10:34:25	Half-Shot	gnarface, valve have done a really decent job with the story if you look at all the law through the comics
2016-02-09 10:34:32	Half-Shot	It's got a lot of charm
2016-02-09 10:34:48	Half-Shot	Overwatch is your hard boiled competitive shooter
2016-02-09 10:34:50	gnarface	oh? i guess i haven't seen any of the comics
2016-02-09 10:34:59	gnarface	i didn't know there were any

2016-02-09 10:36:40	gnarface	so it says here basically they've been retroactively adding story into what started originally as a cast of generic archetypes... cool
2016-02-09 10:37:09	Half-Shot	Yep. They had a neat idea but it was very shallow. So they added lots of depth behind the scenes
2016-02-09 10:37:21	Half-Shot	I think a bunch of valve people just like comic books
2016-02-09 10:37:32	gnarface	nothing wrong with that
2016-02-09 10:37:34	psymin	I like comic books!  What a coincidence!
2016-02-09 10:37:56	Half-Shot	It's one of the coolest ways to do a video game law, that's for sure.

2016-02-09 10:39:42	stqn	yeah… it’s better with friends.
2016-02-09 10:40:09	stqn	I was wondering if they added fun stuff to do solo
2016-02-09 10:40:15	gnarface	stqn: so, basically starting last fall when there was this explosion of new games on steam that really cut into my WoW time... well, that and a couple key releases on Nintendo
2016-02-09 10:41:05	gnarface	stqn: well there's a TON more content now, if you have all the expansions.  there's a lot more area too, several completely new continents, etc, and a massively overhauled UI that makes stuff alot easier
2016-02-09 10:41:36	gnarface	stqn: i'm not all about questing solo though; i'm in it for the PvP
2016-02-09 10:41:47	stqn	ah ok, makes sense.
2016-02-09 10:41:59	stqn	I don’t like pvp much
2016-02-09 10:42:35	gnarface	i like to experience the raids and end-game content and some of the story and stuff, but i'm not one of those guys who will just play the same raids over and over again every night... i seek the thrill of the hunt.  the adrenaline rush you can only get from fighting sentient beings
2016-02-09 10:43:10	gnarface	raid bosses are just ... too predictable
2016-02-09 10:43:36	gnarface	and questing gets boring to me after a while if i'm just doing it alone
2016-02-09 10:43:44	stqn	yep
2016-02-09 10:43:50	stqn	exactly…
2016-02-09 10:44:09	stqn	I really enjoyed instances but you need a good group

2016-02-09 10:44:44	gnarface	finding 39 other people who aren't retarded is really hard
2016-02-09 10:45:19	stqn	which is why I never did any raid… almost

2016-02-09 10:48:33	gnarface	really my biggest complaint about it is that it seems like the quality of people has dropped. i'm not sure why exactly, but WoW players used to all seem like cool nerds, and now they mostly seem like trolling douchebags
2016-02-09 10:48:43	gnarface	just a bunch of sarcastic griefing assholes
2016-02-09 10:48:55	gnarface	what game are all the cool nerds playing now?
2016-02-09 10:49:01	gnarface	i haven't figured it out
2016-02-09 10:49:17	gnarface	maybe they made wow too easy? or maybe it just got too popular
2016-02-09 10:49:19	gnarface	i dunno
2016-02-09 10:49:57	gnarface	on a good day you can still, if you're lucky, get 25 or so cooperative intellectuals together by chance and win in Ashran though

2016-02-09 10:52:36	gnarface	maybe just early on when i knew personally people who actually played and i was in a guild with them, mabye they shielded me from the drama caused by the griefers and the farmers and the idiots
2016-02-09 10:53:01	gnarface	once they all got bored of it and moved on to games you can't play in wine, i was left stranded
2016-02-09 10:55:58	gnarface	i'll bend alot of principle just for escapism and an occasional sense of camaraderie ... but i won't go so far as to install windows.  f that
2016-02-09 10:57:51	gnarface	if i could run my own WoW server i could just ban everyone who pissed me off :-p

2016-02-09 11:31:34	No1RL355	stqn, its external drive
2016-02-09 11:31:56	No1RL355	Im used it to backup my things
2016-02-09 11:32:11	gnarface	No1RL355: hashes of files with empty space might change if you move them to different filesystem types i think, due to differnences of sparse/non-sparse handling of concurrent sectors of zeros
2016-02-09 11:32:13	No1RL355	but looks like it changes files time-by time

2016-02-09 11:33:51	gnarface	No1RL355: even like if there's a linux boot disk ISO in there somewhere, even after you've tar&gzipped the whole thing, could throw the checksum off

2016-02-09 11:34:37	No1RL355	moved it on disk and forgot about it

2016-02-09 11:35:54	gnarface	well, the bad seagate drives should be isolated to some specific model numbers.  you can look that up

2016-02-09 12:21:53	dagget10	windows 10 repair killed grub XD
2016-02-09 12:22:57	gnarface	people have been telling me i need windows since i stopped using it like 17 years ago....
2016-02-09 12:23:13	gnarface	so far i haven't seen any proof
2016-02-09 12:23:15	qptain_Nemo	gnarface: why did you say installing grub would lock one out of w10?
2016-02-09 12:23:32	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: wishful thinking?
2016-02-09 12:23:34	dagget10	windows is only better than linux in the fact you dont have to deal with wine
2016-02-09 12:23:46	qptain_Nemo	dagget10: i'd disagree even there
2016-02-09 12:23:50	dagget10	windows died at windows 8 though, so no big deal about wine
2016-02-09 12:24:01	qptain_Nemo	wine gives you a degree of freedom with using windows applications that you don't have on windows

2016-02-09 12:25:20	GolBot	[ WineHQ - Trove Release ]
2016-02-09 12:25:57	dagget10	i have never heard of anyone getting trove running properly on linux
2016-02-09 12:26:29	gnarface	dagget10: according to this, someone did, around september of last year
2016-02-09 12:26:42	dagget10	ill have to see if it works
2016-02-09 12:26:51	gnarface	doesn't look easy, definitely looks possible
2016-02-09 12:28:20	dagget10	i think ill stick to windows 10...
2016-02-09 12:28:40	dagget10	besides, i highly doubt i can run naninights on linux
2016-02-09 12:28:56	gnarface	you're free to do what you like, i was merely objecting to your definition of "need"
2016-02-09 12:29:25	gnarface	as long as you tell yourself its a "need" you're ceding responsibility for your actions
2016-02-09 12:29:50	gnarface	when you admit its a desire, a want, and one based primarily on laziness, only then you can stop being a victim
2016-02-09 12:30:11	gnarface	only then can you use your computer, instead of being used BY your computer
2016-02-09 12:32:29	gnarface	even if you don't want to deal with wine, you could always be running windows in a VM inside your linux install, rather than the other way around
2016-02-09 12:32:59	gnarface	kvm runs windows on linux so well now even microsoft chooses to do it that way for their azure platform
2016-02-09 12:32:59	dagget10	its not that simple
2016-02-09 12:33:35	dagget10	im actually running windows 10, and using a guest vm of windows 10
2016-02-09 12:33:47	dagget10	on the guest vm, im going to make a guest vm of linux
2016-02-09 12:34:11	dagget10	also if i randomly leave, my host system hit a bluescreen
2016-02-09 12:34:28	gnarface	hilarious, but i still don't see how that's any easier than doing it the other way around, with linux as the host.  in fact it sounds a lot like you're making it harder on yourself than necessary
2016-02-09 12:34:51	gnarface	which is truly sadly ironic, if you're doing this to make it easier on yourself
2016-02-09 12:35:03	gnarface	but you'd hardly be the first windows user in such a position
2016-02-09 12:35:20	gnarface	their brainwashing is very good
2016-02-09 12:35:34	dagget10	ok plan b
2016-02-09 12:35:42	dagget10	whats an easy to install bootloader
2016-02-09 12:36:13	gnarface	that's the wrong question
2016-02-09 12:36:27	dagget10	why?
2016-02-09 12:36:44	gnarface	there are really only two, lilo and grub.  and you don't choose either based on ease-of-install
2016-02-09 12:37:38	dagget10	well, how can i install grub without destroying windows 10?
2016-02-09 12:38:06	gnarface	the easiest way you mean? remove the windows10 drive first.  put linux on a different drive
2016-02-09 12:38:22	dagget10	alright ill try another way
2016-02-09 12:38:23	gnarface	use your bios to select which one to boot from
2016-02-09 12:38:39	gnarface	you know what a livecd is right?
2016-02-09 12:38:42	dagget10	ill format the 2nd partition and put ubuntu there
2016-02-09 12:38:45	dagget10	no clue :D
2016-02-09 12:38:50	gnarface	oh
2016-02-09 12:38:52	gnarface	well shoot
2016-02-09 12:38:56	gnarface	hang on for all that
2016-02-09 12:39:03	gnarface	you need to know what a livecd is
2016-02-09 12:39:12	dagget10	here i have an idea
2016-02-09 12:39:13	gnarface	do you have a spare USB key with nothing you care about on it?
2016-02-09 12:39:27	dagget10	how can i put mint ON a usb key
2016-02-09 12:39:37	gnarface	THAT is the right question
2016-02-09 12:39:52	dagget10	not to install on a computer, as an actual system
2016-02-09 12:39:58	gnarface	yep
2016-02-09 12:40:19	gnarface	the answer is "the same way you'd put it on any normal harddrive"
2016-02-09 12:40:21	gnarface	but
2016-02-09 12:40:35	gnarface	you should try a "live" image first
2016-02-09 12:40:44	dagget10	whats live image
2016-02-09 12:41:04	gnarface	grok this: https://www.debian.org/CD/live/
2016-02-09 12:41:04	GolBot	[ Debian -- Live install images ]
2016-02-09 12:41:39	gnarface	its like a pocket pre-made linux install you can carry on USB basically.
2016-02-09 12:41:47	gnarface	no installation necessary
2016-02-09 12:41:50	gnarface	it just boots
2016-02-09 12:41:55	dagget10	so i need a live version of mint
2016-02-09 12:42:15	stqn	I use syslinux
2016-02-09 12:42:18	gnarface	not NEED.  WANT.  you *could* just do a regular install of mint on a USB key too.  unlike windows, linux doesn't care
2016-02-09 12:42:29	gnarface	but the live versions make it alot easier
2016-02-09 12:42:31	stqn	grub and lilo are dead ;)
2016-02-09 12:42:32	qptain_Nemo	aren't all mint distributions livecd/usbs by default?
2016-02-09 12:42:33	gnarface	and more portable
2016-02-09 12:42:49	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: honestly i don't know that much about mint
2016-02-09 12:43:02	qptain_Nemo	i think they are
2016-02-09 12:43:34	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: they might be hybrid-iso by default now because debian is, but that's not necessarily the same as it being "live"
2016-02-09 12:43:51	qptain_Nemo	i'm pretty sure they are

2016-02-09 12:47:17	dagget10	alright, so how do i install it on
2016-02-09 12:47:33	gnarface	dd
2016-02-09 12:47:43	gnarface	dagget10: on linux, you'd just put it on a USB key with dd
2016-02-09 12:47:54	dagget10	dd?
2016-02-09 12:48:10	gnarface	dagget10: yep.  dd, a very old native program in linux.  from windows, you need a 3rd party program called rawrite i think

2016-02-09 12:49:59	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: are you?

2016-02-09 12:56:00	dagget10	took 30 seconds
2016-02-09 12:56:03	gnarface	oh
2016-02-09 12:56:07	gnarface	that uh... sounds way too fast
2016-02-09 12:56:11	gnarface	what did you try?

2016-02-09 12:56:35	gnarface	you did that from windows?
2016-02-09 12:56:42	dagget10	yea
2016-02-09 12:56:48	gnarface	windows has dd now??
2016-02-09 12:56:55	dagget10	cygwin
2016-02-09 12:57:07	gnarface	fascinating
2016-02-09 12:57:21	gnarface	well you're already in over my head.  like i said, i haven't used windows in almost 20 years
2016-02-09 12:57:39	dagget10	should i try it?
2016-02-09 12:57:40	gnarface	it should take a lot longer than 30 seconds to DD a 1GB iso to a usb key though
2016-02-09 12:58:22	dagget10	if i open the usb key should i see any files?
2016-02-09 12:58:41	gnarface	dagget10: on linux you would.  i don't know crap about windows, and even less about cygwin
2016-02-09 12:59:36	gnarface	dagget10: i expect due to the short copy time that it won't work though
2016-02-09 13:00:39	gnarface	dagget10: frankly, i can't advocate you do anything at all until you're sure.  i won't be responsible for you accidentally hosing your windows install

2016-02-09 13:01:02	dagget10	3.5 seconds
2016-02-09 13:01:14	dagget10	and the key is empty
2016-02-09 13:01:18	gnarface	dagget10: in a fair world, it should be a simple matter of calling a dd command like that, but in linux the paths would look all different, and due to the physical limitations of usb keys, it should take ... the better part of an hour really
2016-02-09 13:01:33	gnarface	at least
2016-02-09 13:02:03	gnarface	i'm sure someone has done this successfully from windows, but i have not
2016-02-09 13:02:20	dagget10	they have, i looked it up earlier
2016-02-09 13:02:28	dagget10	i need 2 usb keys and i only have 1
2016-02-09 13:03:04	gnarface	you said you had linux running in a VM?  maybe try it from inside the linux VM
2016-02-09 13:03:28	dagget10	i could try, but ill have to download an ubuntu iso
2016-02-09 13:03:45	dagget10	vmware wont load mint
2016-02-09 13:03:47	gnarface	dagget10: how big is the "linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-64bit.iso" file?
2016-02-09 13:04:10	dagget10	1.47gb
2016-02-09 13:04:17	gnarface	sounds right
2016-02-09 13:04:23	gnarface	ballpark at least
2016-02-09 13:05:44	gnarface	but its not *physically possible* for it to copy all that to a USB flash key in less than about 20 minutes
2016-02-09 13:05:59	gnarface	for most cheap USB flash keys it would probably take twice that amount of time
2016-02-09 13:06:50	gnarface	all i can tell you for sure is i think you're on the right path now
2016-02-09 13:06:58	gnarface	just ... be careful where you point dd
2016-02-09 13:07:04	gnarface	you can cause a lot of damage with it
2016-02-09 13:09:00	dagget10	im using something called linux live usb creator
2016-02-09 13:09:08	dagget10	live or persistent
2016-02-09 13:09:14	dagget10	and what is persistent linux
2016-02-09 13:09:45	gnarface	oh so, a normal live usb won't save your stuff after reboot.  it resets to stock after every reboot.  you probably want persistent
2016-02-09 13:10:27	gnarface	a persistent live image will behave more like a normal install; but be warned, it will cause additional wear on your USB key
2016-02-09 13:11:03	gnarface	(as in, do NOT do this if your USB key has some sort of sentimental value, or if you cannot afford to replace it)
2016-02-09 13:12:39	dagget10	well it was a $10 key from walmart, its only value is 32 gb
2016-02-09 13:13:34	gnarface	there's no guarantee it will die quickly either
2016-02-09 13:13:55	gnarface	its hit&miss
2016-02-09 13:14:56	gnarface	they can last a very long time being used like this too, but occasionally you find one with a flaw, and doing persistence will tend to expose those flaws much quicker
2016-02-09 13:15:29	dagget10	should i just use live and then use onedrive?
2016-02-09 13:15:51	gnarface	up to you really
2016-02-09 13:16:22	gnarface	that would probably significantly reduce wear though, yes
2016-02-09 13:16:30	gnarface	since it would be read-only
2016-02-09 13:16:39	gnarface	its the writes that cause the extra wear
2016-02-09 13:17:19	gnarface	due to the way linux filesystems are (journaling by default) writes cause a lot more wear to flash than with fat32, which is NOT journalin g
2016-02-09 13:17:23	gnarface	*journaling

2016-02-09 14:39:10	drumr	um yeah
2016-02-09 14:39:12	drumr	of course
2016-02-09 14:39:18	Mneuro	?
2016-02-09 14:39:50	Mneuro	g3258 performs about 50% as well on linux as windows, but i'm noticing the i5-4590 is basically exactly the same on windows and linux
2016-02-09 14:40:03	Mneuro	i'm guessing since it's a cpu there is no reason to have performance loss, but the g3258 seems to be bad
2016-02-09 14:40:28	drumr	yeah its worse than a celeron
2016-02-09 14:40:41	Mneuro	Either way, I am so glad to be able to play my games acceptably on linux now
2016-02-09 14:40:57	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:41:03	Mneuro	Tried alien.  On the g3258 i got like 30fps on medium settings and with the i5 i get 60fps on ultra
2016-02-09 14:41:07	drumr	what did you have before
2016-02-09 14:41:29	drumr	yeah the g3258 is not a gaming cpu
2016-02-09 14:41:30	Mneuro	I had a G3258 CPU and GTX 960 GPU
2016-02-09 14:41:34	Mneuro	yea it is
2016-02-09 14:41:49	Mneuro	it's a special dual core that can be overclocked a lot
2016-02-09 14:41:56	Mneuro	it actually outperforms most/all i3's

2016-02-09 14:44:23	Mneuro	it is right neck and neck with an i3-4130 at stock
2016-02-09 14:44:28	Mneuro	and can be overclocked to 4.5ghz
2016-02-09 14:44:48	Mneuro	it doesn't really matter because on linux it is absolute rubbish
2016-02-09 14:45:10	Mneuro	The i5-4590 is amazing
2016-02-09 14:45:24	drumr	i would never use an i3 for gaming
2016-02-09 14:45:29	drumr	ever
2016-02-09 14:45:51	Mneuro	me either, the g3258 was just a stopgap solution to hold me over until i could get an i5.  it was only $50 so no real loss
2016-02-09 14:46:02	drumr	ah
2016-02-09 14:46:08	Mneuro	i3's aren't really worth the price
2016-02-09 14:46:10	drumr	that would be different since boards support so many
2016-02-09 14:46:18	Mneuro	i can also play grid now on ultra <3

2016-02-09 14:48:46	Mneuro	in windows they are alright.  I'm not sure what is the difference really
2016-02-09 14:48:58	Mneuro	in windows i can play alien on 60fps locked with the g3258 on ultra
2016-02-09 14:49:14	Mneuro	maybe just that linux ports seem to be more cpu dependent
2016-02-09 14:49:28	drumr	could be
2016-02-09 14:49:44	drumr	if it was multiplayer it would probably be more dependent on the gpu too
2016-02-09 14:50:14	drumr	yeah gxxxx series is the new celeron

2016-02-09 14:50:33	drumr	i used to view as i3 as those until
2016-02-09 14:50:35	Mneuro	you get a pretty decent bang for your buck with them for sure
2016-02-09 14:50:40	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:50:42	Mneuro	I've never understood i3's
2016-02-09 14:50:47	Mneuro	they just make no sense for their price
2016-02-09 14:50:48	drumr	i would use them in a mini comp or something
2016-02-09 14:50:53	drumr	yeah
2016-02-09 14:51:20	Mneuro	if you are going to pay over 100 USD for a CPU, you might as well get a decent i5 for 150-180

2016-02-15 00:26:11	openfbtd	Also if linux systems become as popular, they will become so because they will cater to the lowest common denominator, so shit
2016-02-15 00:26:46	openfbtd	I see myself using something else in 10 years sitting there sad about not having any games >_>
2016-02-15 00:27:04	openfbtd	Because linux distros became unuseable
2016-02-15 00:27:06	homerj	MS is already on the way out in general
2016-02-15 00:27:18	homerj	but I don't know how much they can hold on
2016-02-15 00:27:52	homerj	Microsoft's real bread & butter has been small and medium range business
2016-02-15 00:28:04	homerj	Exchange license, Active Directory, etc.
2016-02-15 00:28:16	homerj	but that's getting phased out via various cloud offerings
2016-02-15 00:29:00	homerj	10 years ago, if I had a 100 person company and wanted email, that was Exchange
2016-02-15 00:29:17	homerj	today? that's either Google, or 100 other people doing it, and I don't have to manage it
2016-02-15 00:29:41	baizon	i hate that cloud stuff :/
2016-02-15 00:29:46	openfbtd	We have a 100 person IT company and we use a local Exchange because security
2016-02-15 00:29:58	openfbtd	No trust in other companies to not sell our info
2016-02-15 00:30:26	homerj	when you actually use Google for that, they aren't sending you ads
2016-02-15 00:30:47	homerj	when you get into the paid tiers
2016-02-15 00:31:22	openfbtd	It's still pretty idiotic to host corporate email with Google
2016-02-15 00:31:48	baizon	we use office 365 :(
2016-02-15 00:31:59	baizon	thank god i dont have to write, so i can use ubuntu
2016-02-15 00:33:17	homerj	openfbtd, why?
2016-02-15 00:33:34	homerj	Google is about as secure as you can be
2016-02-15 00:33:56	homerj	more so than the VAST majority of Exchange installs

2016-02-15 00:35:46	homerj	openfbtd, what kind of polish do you use for your tin foil hat?
2016-02-15 00:37:38	homerj	but if you REALLY want local, there's things like Zimbra(now owned by vmware)

2016-02-15 00:38:48	homerj	it's generally about $500/year to put Microsoft email on a company desktop
2016-02-15 00:39:26	linux_gamer	GermainZ, WHAT GPU?
2016-02-15 00:39:49	homerj	Exchange/Service licensing, CALs, Office licenses, etc.
2016-02-15 00:40:07	homerj	not to mention another Server install for AD
2016-02-15 00:40:45	linux_gamer	laptop: when its good weather outside you cant see shit or its too cold or you laptop drowns
2016-02-15 00:41:11	homerj	you start adding things like Service Center into the mix, putting an average computer in front of someone can be over a grand a year in MS licenses alone
2016-02-15 00:41:47	homerj	that's how MS makes their cash
2016-02-15 00:42:05	homerj	all this other stuff, mobile, xbox, etc. loses money
2016-02-15 00:43:16	homerj	all the other stuff is where people are going, but they don't want the MS stuff
2016-02-15 00:43:29	homerj	despite MS spending billions trying to be people to use it

2016-02-15 22:37:45	Ysblokje	build a game like a  painting lib ?
2016-02-15 22:38:59	Smilex	oh it's not a library necessarily. It's a editor. But it's difficult and no one seems interested, so I question if I'm going mad. Also I decided to take a break this week sort of, and created a game

2016-02-15 23:00:57	linux_gamer	Samsai, you think 99% of syrians is against the president?
2016-02-15 23:01:13	linux_gamer	and only the soldiers fight for him?
2016-02-15 23:01:28	@Samsai	i mean, if you are fighting for him then yeah
2016-02-15 23:01:40	@Samsai	kinda makes you part of the syrian military, right?
2016-02-15 23:01:45	linux_gamer	im not syrian
2016-02-15 23:02:01	Ysblokje	Samsai, they shoot ppl who wont join the army
2016-02-15 23:02:07	linux_gamer	i can confess, unlike 60-80% of "syrian" "rebels"
2016-02-15 23:02:45	Ysblokje	no matter which side, you're fucked
2016-02-15 23:03:52	linux_gamer	thats right
2016-02-15 23:05:02	@Samsai	being on the russian's side significantly reduces your chances of getting hit by an air strike
2016-02-15 23:05:09	@Samsai	provided you are not within syria
2016-02-15 23:06:18	linux_gamer	russian blames us for some some of the bombing in aleppo
2016-02-15 23:06:36	@Samsai	sounds familiar
2016-02-15 23:06:47	@Samsai	are you sure it wasn't an artillery strike?
2016-02-15 23:06:56	linux_gamer	to keep in mind russia is active <6 months -> IS has lost massive area
2016-02-15 23:07:10	Smilex	Ysblokje: I didn't mention it, but maybe you figured it out. To compile you run the build.sh in the build directory
2016-02-15 23:07:23	linux_gamer	coalition forces (2 year) -> IS spread like cancer
2016-02-15 23:07:53	Ysblokje	Smilex,  I am trying to resist writing a CMakeLists.txt file \;)
2016-02-15 23:07:54	linux_gamer	Smilex, ./configure; make; make install
2016-02-15 23:08:11	@Samsai	i imagine IS would be a lot smaller threat if russia directed more of their weaponry at them
2016-02-15 23:08:30	linux_gamer	bs, look at the borders left to right
2016-02-15 23:08:44	linux_gamer	government, "rebel", IS
2016-02-15 23:08:53	@Samsai	currently only about 10% of their capability targets IS targets
2016-02-15 23:08:57	linux_gamer	how to attack IS, makes not much sense
2016-02-15 23:09:03	@Samsai	rest of it is kinda all over the place
2016-02-15 23:09:13	linux_gamer	10% is way better than 0%
2016-02-15 23:09:18	@Samsai	sure
2016-02-15 23:09:35	linux_gamer	remember US needed month to save kobane?

2016-02-15 23:11:30	frankyboy_	who needs prove? it is a fact that civilians are suffering from airstrikes
2016-02-15 23:12:45	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, US: russia attacked a hospital a (obscure) source said! RU: "give us the name and location" US: We can't its secret. RU: OK, got it
2016-02-15 23:12:55	frankyboy_	thing is there are sooo many russian air strikes every day... i start wondering if situation is too bad out there
2016-02-15 23:13:36	linux_gamer	there are russian but where the fuck are any coalition strikes?
2016-02-15 23:14:05	linux_gamer	IS can showcase their equipment freely in deir-Ezzor
2016-02-15 23:14:06	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, are there reports of stries?
2016-02-15 23:14:13	frankyboy_	strikes*
2016-02-15 23:14:29	@Samsai	well, the coalition has also struck a hospital with an air strike
2016-02-15 23:14:35	@Samsai	that stuff got spread around quite nicely
2016-02-15 23:15:04	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, just imagine US needed 10 weeks to free Kobane, a fcking village
2016-02-15 23:15:10	linux_gamer	Samsai, thats riht
2016-02-15 23:15:49	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, yup, but syrian army is fighting long time too against rebels or "rebels"
2016-02-15 23:16:19	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, they didnt secure the borders any country with openborders is fcked up
2016-02-15 23:16:43	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i don't think it is that easy to secure borders
2016-02-15 23:17:04	linux_gamer	you see the map and you can clearly see the IS(back then) and rebel now supply route to turkey
2016-02-15 23:17:12	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats the problem
2016-02-15 23:17:44	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, Merkel said its impssible to secure the border to Germany
2016-02-15 23:17:58	frankyboy_	problem is that coalition isn't working together
2016-02-15 23:18:43	linux_gamer	bs, theres like 7cm of border per inhabitant in germany
2016-02-15 23:18:52	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i've seen videos how refugees get to eu with interviews how much they pay to travel to eu.
2016-02-15 23:19:09	linux_gamer	greek border is hard to secure
2016-02-15 23:19:18	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, you ought to read documents about refugees.
2016-02-15 23:19:31	frankyboy_	and how this status is occured and what it grants
2016-02-15 23:19:57	linux_gamer	i myself could build a wall like at least 100m high for my personal 7cm of german borders
2016-02-15 23:20:27	linux_gamer	problem is one just has to take a step left or right
2016-02-15 23:20:58	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, eu and border?
2016-02-15 23:21:08	@Samsai	well, obviously the solution to this problem is to build walls around ourselves and just shield ourselves from that scary scary world outside
2016-02-15 23:21:11	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats a joke i know
2016-02-15 23:21:24	@Samsai	because addressing the symptom and not the cause has always worked
2016-02-15 23:21:26	linux_gamer	Samsai, look at the isreali
2016-02-15 23:21:44	@Samsai	i have, looks kinda terrible
2016-02-15 23:22:01	linux_gamer	suicide bombings every now and then -> wall -> no explosive attacks for years
2016-02-15 23:22:05	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, i don't quite understand... are you against people saving their lives from wall?
2016-02-15 23:22:26	linux_gamer	no, wall saves lives
2016-02-15 23:22:27	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, suiciders are using another tacics now
2016-02-15 23:22:44	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, thats sadly true
2016-02-15 23:22:48	frankyboy_	life in Israel isn't that easy even nowdays.
2016-02-15 23:23:06	frankyboy_	so i don't think your example with Israel suits well
2016-02-15 23:23:15	@Samsai	it's easy to build a wall and then simply ignore anything that goes on behind it
2016-02-15 23:23:18	frankyboy_	imho, tho
2016-02-15 23:23:23	linux_gamer	at least the people have the feeling the gov wants to support them
2016-02-15 23:23:40	linux_gamer	Samsai, are you against firewalls
2016-02-15 23:24:01	@Samsai	i am against blinding myself from the world
2016-02-15 23:24:14	linux_gamer	we could tear down all firewalls and pay the virus-programmers for a better live
2016-02-15 23:24:22	linux_gamer	so that they stop attacking us
2016-02-15 23:24:33	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, how many real refugees and how many fake refugees in germany? what's your opinon?
2016-02-15 23:24:54	linux_gamer	good idea? that would even work for win users ;-) ;-P
2016-02-15 23:25:20	@Samsai	so you think everyone behind the wall is evil and out to kill you?
2016-02-15 23:25:37	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, there cant be refugees because nobody is beeing persecuted in austria
2016-02-15 23:25:47	@Samsai	great, you even have the right attitude
2016-02-15 23:25:53	linux_gamer	Samsai, depends on the wall
2016-02-15 23:25:54	@Samsai	now all that you need is the wall
2016-02-15 23:26:35	linux_gamer	Samsai, wont happen
2016-02-15 23:27:20	linux_gamer	bs to build a wall between germany and austria
2016-02-15 23:27:38	linux_gamer	that would have been 90 years too lake
2016-02-15 23:27:43	frankyboy_	linux_gamer, so refugees can't travel across eu?
2016-02-15 23:28:12	linux_gamer	frankyboy_, many eruropean countries are starting to secure their border
2016-02-15 23:28:20	linux_gamer	european

2016-02-15 23:35:19	linux_gamer	ok one shouldnt as its from cnn (sry for bbc)
2016-02-15 23:35:27	frankyboy_	Samsai, what to trust?
2016-02-15 23:35:45	linux_gamer	you shouldn't trust any "news"
2016-02-15 23:35:52	@Samsai	frankyboy_, not a single source and definitely not a russian source
2016-02-15 23:36:12	frankyboy_	Samsai, well, lol... why definitely?
2016-02-15 23:36:45	frankyboy_	not that i am offended cause i am russian, but curious why definitely?
2016-02-15 23:36:47	@Samsai	because all russian sources are government-owned and they spread bullshit

2016-02-15 23:38:01	Smilex	or at least was
2016-02-15 23:38:09	@Samsai	frankyboy_, the problem is more that the russian sources are owned by the russian government
2016-02-15 23:38:28	frankyboy_	also, how do you know that rt is spreading bullshit? what confirm this?
2016-02-15 23:38:45	@Samsai	i've checked their articles every now and then
2016-02-15 23:38:56	@Samsai	there's an obvious bias against western countries
2016-02-15 23:39:21	frankyboy_	ok, so no obvious bias from western countries againt russia?
2016-02-15 23:39:29	@Samsai	the one good thing that can be said about them is that they aren't as openly anti-finland as other sources
2016-02-15 23:39:35	linux_gamer	Samsai, us are owned by us, finish are ...
2016-02-15 23:40:07	@Samsai	frankyboy_, when it comes to US sources, there's definitely a huge bias against russia
2016-02-15 23:40:18	frankyboy_	Samsai, so same bullshit?
2016-02-15 23:40:25	@Samsai	with US sources, definitely
2016-02-15 23:40:43	frankyboy_	and why definitely only to russian sourses? ^^ that is of what i am curios
2016-02-15 23:40:46	Smilex	The US had the right idea. Privatize media, but keep the sound waves public property, and only distribute frequencies to those that air non-profit news at 7pm
2016-02-15 23:41:18	@Samsai	frankyboy_, because i consider russian sources to be even more untrustworthy than the US media
2016-02-15 23:41:45	frankyboy_	 i see... that is personal point, right?
2016-02-15 23:41:53	frankyboy_	point of view*
2016-02-15 23:42:15	@Samsai	let's just say it's a point of view from someone living right next to russia

2016-02-16 05:28:39	aspidites	ping tumocs
2016-02-16 05:28:56	aspidites	I bought the game a month ago and have yet to be able to play it on my desktop
2016-02-16 05:29:10	tumocs	waddap?
2016-02-16 05:29:13	tumocs	it works
2016-02-16 05:29:15	tumocs	fine
2016-02-16 05:29:32	aspidites	no usable logs, can't inspect it with gdb, filing a ticket was useless ("did you lower graphics settings? Please provide an error log")
2016-02-16 05:29:40	aspidites	are you using an nvidia graphics card, tumocs ?
2016-02-16 05:29:44	tumocs	nope
2016-02-16 05:29:49	tumocs	amd with mesa
2016-02-16 05:29:55	tumocs	my friend run it with nvidia
2016-02-16 05:29:57	tumocs	and arch
2016-02-16 05:30:21	tumocs	in the beginning I had to move the game_x64 to launcher folder for it to work
2016-02-16 05:30:29	tumocs	don't know if you still have to do it
2016-02-16 05:30:34	aspidites	huh, let me try that
2016-02-16 05:30:55	tumocs	if it doesn't, clean the shit up, uninstall and reinstall and do that before updating
2016-02-16 05:31:22	tumocs	yup, I still can log in
2016-02-16 05:31:39	aspidites	is it enough to delete everything from the albiononline directory, or are there transient files elsewhere?
2016-02-16 05:31:55	tumocs	I wouldn't remember
2016-02-16 05:32:16	aspidites	ah ok, thanks anyway
2016-02-16 05:32:31	aspidites	so i'm redownloading the installer after nuking the old directory (and running the installer script)
2016-02-16 05:32:43	aspidites	after that i'll just move game_x64 to launcher and cross my fingers

2016-02-16 05:34:23	aspidites	i'm wondering if there's some library i'm missnig -- I remember reading about audio issues some where
2016-02-16 05:34:34	aspidites	me too -- -Syu'd 10 minutes ago
2016-02-16 05:34:39	tumocs	with the launcher script it should preload necessary libraries
2016-02-16 05:35:21	mirv_	Samsai, article inactive?
2016-02-16 05:35:51	aspidites	nope. Completely black
2016-02-16 05:35:56	aspidites	tumocs: what DE/WM are you using>?
2016-02-16 05:36:09	tumocs	I've run it with xfce and plasma5

2016-02-16 05:36:35	tumocs	check the ldd and the prepackaged libraries and see if you miss something
2016-02-16 05:36:55	aspidites	did that already, but i'll do it again

2016-02-16 05:47:39	aspidites	if only i3 would allow a universal title bar
2016-02-16 05:47:45	aspidites	so much wasted screen real estate

2016-02-16 05:49:10	aspidites	thanks for the info Spl-it
2016-02-16 05:49:12	Spl-it	title bars ? I disabled those

2016-02-16 05:50:23	aspidites	and i didn't want them to be super loud as that was distracting
2016-02-16 05:50:37	aspidites	so border change + single title where my dmenu pops up was a nice compromise

2016-02-16 07:02:26	DrMcCoy	I do have certain legal arguments I can use, like the interoperatibility clauses
2016-02-16 07:02:37	DrMcCoy	But these are defenses
2016-02-16 07:02:53	gnarface	should be protected by "clean-room reverse-engineering" clause, no?
2016-02-16 07:02:55	DrMcCoy	They don't safe me from being hit by a legal threat in the first place

2016-02-16 07:04:19	DrMcCoy	So by going a straight "No piracy" route, and orienting myself at existing project like ScummVM, GemRB and OpenMW, I'm hoping that it doesn't come this far
2016-02-16 07:06:41	DrMcCoy	Will that be enough? I can never be 100% sure
2016-02-16 07:07:09	DrMcCoy	That's the same, of course, for ScummVM, GemRB and OpenMW
2016-02-16 07:11:16	@Samsai	it's weird that a company even has a case if they sue a reverse-engineered project that only ships a binary and nothing else
2016-02-16 07:12:07	@Samsai	but laws and judges are weird
2016-02-16 07:13:06	gnarface	well its not really that they have a case its more that they have a right to sue even without a case
2016-02-16 07:13:20	DrMcCoy	Yes
2016-02-16 07:13:43	DrMcCoy	And a lawsuit takes times, money and nerves
2016-02-16 07:13:55	gnarface	which is frankly bullshit, but not as bullshit as the fact that you would have to *counter-sue* to recoup damages for accrued legal fees defending yourself, even if the case is thrown out with prejudice
2016-02-16 07:14:05	@Samsai	gnarface, knowing how the current system operates in many places there would be a case
2016-02-16 07:14:13	DrMcCoy	gnarface: Well, that depends on the jurisdiction
2016-02-16 07:14:29	@Samsai	and i am afraid a project like xoreos or openmw would end up losing if a company really decides to run them over
2016-02-16 07:14:36	gnarface	i think if you lose the lawsuit *and you were the plaintiff* you should *automatically* also have to cover the defense's legal costs
2016-02-16 07:16:36	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdictions do that
2016-02-16 07:16:39	gnarface	hopefully it would be simple though in the case of xoreos to just show the code and prove it was all based on purely reverse-engineered knowledge, none of it literally stolen from their office development code repos, and then get the case succinctly thrown out
2016-02-16 07:16:58	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdiction let the court decide how both sides' costs are split
2016-02-16 07:17:23	DrMcCoy	Some jurisdictions let the court just mandate a flat fee (which often doesn't cover basically anything)
2016-02-16 07:19:06	DrMcCoy	The problem, still, is of course that you need to have a whole wad of cash upfront first
2016-02-16 07:24:29	DrMcCoy	If I were sued, I'd first contact the Software Freedom Conservancy and the Software Feedom Law Center. That's not quite their speciality (they do GPL enforcement), but they might have some pointers
2016-02-16 07:24:47	gnarface	yea, that sucks, and at least here in the US, alot of big companies aim law suits at smaller competitors knowing that it will bankrupt them regardless of the outcome of the case
2016-02-16 07:25:23	DrMcCoy	As for a lawyer here in Germany, my sister's BF has lawyer in the family (none of the specializing on copyright law, though), and my father's cousin works in court. So I might have referals there
2016-02-16 07:25:29	gnarface	the EFF has been known to champion such causes though
2016-02-16 07:25:40	gnarface	(Electronic Frontier Foundation)
2016-02-16 07:25:52	gnarface	they've provided legal backing for smaller projects that couldn't afford their own defense
2016-02-16 07:25:53	DrMcCoy	Right, yes :)
2016-02-16 07:26:45	gnarface	i would, in such a position send the first email to the EFF and the second one to Slashdot

2016-02-16 07:27:12	DrMcCoy	There's also the question where someone will sue me. Whether it'll be in Germany or in the US. For the latter case, I'm not sure I'd be extradicted for a civil suit
2016-02-16 07:27:30	gnarface	yea i don't think they could do shit to you from here
2016-02-16 07:28:19	DrMcCoy	And in Germany, courts are in general more sane
2016-02-16 07:28:20	gnarface	but i guess where they even *can* sue you depends on where they even hold copyrights
2016-02-16 07:28:47	gnarface	if the specific content isn't copyrighted in germany that makes you a lot safer
2016-02-16 07:29:13	DrMcCoy	The Berne Convention pretty much makes it an international thing

2016-02-16 07:30:19	lemony123	what have I missed?
2016-02-16 07:30:27	DrMcCoy	For a big corporation, it's no problem getting them registered "everywhere"
2016-02-16 07:30:58	gnarface	but retroactively? isn't a lot of this content a couple decades old in the first place?
2016-02-16 07:31:18	gnarface	would it still count for older games if they weren't registered "everywhere" back then?
2016-02-16 07:31:40	DrMcCoy	Well, "BioWare" is probably registed everywhere
2016-02-16 07:31:44	DrMcCoy	As is "Star Wars"
2016-02-16 07:32:06	gnarface	ah, yea
2016-02-16 07:32:08	gnarface	hmm
2016-02-16 07:32:12	DrMcCoy	Neverwinter Nights probably too, since there's also WotC/Hasbro in it
2016-02-16 07:32:42	homerj	you see, the flaw with these kinds of projects, people just need to do them and release it when it's complete

2016-02-16 07:55:16	DrMcCoy	Fenix2412: C++
2016-02-16 07:55:40	DrMcCoy	C++03, to be precise
2016-02-16 07:55:51	Gallomimia	03??
2016-02-16 07:55:53	Fenix2412	k
2016-02-16 07:55:58	DrMcCoy	For compatibility reasons, I'm eschewing C++11
2016-02-16 07:56:11	gnarface	DrMcCoy: i still plan on joining your project but i have some emotional issues to overcome first (primarily a fundamental mistrust of github) and i'd in all honestly be learning a lot more from what you wrote than actually contributing anything of value, i'd be dead weight probably
2016-02-16 07:56:51	gnarface	still, it sounds like a good way to grow skills
2016-02-16 07:56:52	DrMcCoy	gnarface: You are free to use xoreos as a learning thing any time, of course
2016-02-16 07:57:25	DrMcCoy	And yes, I'm not all too keen on GitHub either, especially since GitHub itself is proprietary code
2016-02-16 07:57:34	gnarface	maybe i could help migrate some of the opengl 1.x code to opengl 3.x :-p
2016-02-16 07:57:47	gnarface	then it would only be like 10 years out of date
2016-02-16 07:57:54	DrMcCoy	But it's currently the best option, "network-effect"-wise
2016-02-16 07:58:17	DrMcCoy	Thankfully, the repos being in git, it's easy to move if it's necessary
2016-02-16 07:58:36	Gallomimia	i got the same issue as gnarface
2016-02-16 07:58:55	Gallomimia	learn more than contribute. but it's not the first time i've done that for a project
2016-02-16 07:59:22	Gallomimia	also yes. mistrust for github
2016-02-16 08:01:01	DrMcCoy	When I joined ScummVM back in 2006 to take up the gob engine (Coktel Vision games: Gobliiins, Woodruff and the Schnibble, ...), I learned a lot
2016-02-16 08:01:17	Ysblokje	DrMcCoy, what comp. issues do you expect with c++11?
2016-02-16 08:01:50	DrMcCoy	Ysblokje: For example, my Mac OS X cross-compiler, that produces Mac OS X >= 10.5 binaries on my Linux system, would choke :P
2016-02-16 08:02:11	DrMcCoy	It's a gcc 4.2.1
2016-02-16 08:02:38	Ysblokje	ah, okay.
2016-02-16 08:02:45	gnarface	i agree with the avoiding C++11 for now; you wouldn't be able to run scummvm on a palm pilot if it'd been written in C++11
2016-02-16 08:03:02	DrMcCoy	Hell, ScummVM doesn't even use the STL or exceptions
2016-02-16 08:03:03	*	Ysblokje loves c++11
2016-02-16 08:03:15	gnarface	portability is king
2016-02-16 08:03:18	Ysblokje	saves a few bytes over boost::
2016-02-16 08:03:25	Ysblokje	std:: ;)
2016-02-16 08:03:34	DrMcCoy	lol
2016-02-16 08:03:59	Ysblokje	But I only write stuff for linux systems that have to at some point work on windows. so thats luxery

2016-02-16 08:04:58	DrMcCoy	gnarface: Apropos ScummVM: ScummVM could also use porters for various platforms. Some of the current ones are starting to not have time, not having the device anymore, etc. There's some platforms that didn't have a release in ages now, unfortunately
2016-02-16 08:05:25	DrMcCoy	gnarface: So if you have too much time on your hands, you might want to look there as well
2016-02-16 08:05:43	gnarface	DrMcCoy: well, if the last build still works i dunno why one would need to update it, but my palm tungsten t5 does still work....
2016-02-16 08:06:00	DrMcCoy	gnarface: To get support for more games, for example
2016-02-16 08:06:05	DrMcCoy	And bugfixes

2016-02-16 08:14:51	Ysblokje	well not perse
2016-02-16 08:14:58	Ysblokje	some errors are part of a chain
2016-02-16 08:15:00	madmachinations	Hey everyone, just wondering if anybody has a laptop with a combo 3.5mm audio socket instead of the typical 2? If so have you tried it with a headset and did it give you any bullshit? Mine flat out refuses to detect anything other than the internal microphone.
2016-02-16 08:15:07	Smilex	Ysblokje: chain?
2016-02-16 08:15:21	Ysblokje	You call a function that creates a something
2016-02-16 08:15:50	Ysblokje	if you dont call the destruct for that thing some other things stay too
2016-02-16 08:15:57	Smilex	What? I do a lot of that.
2016-02-16 08:16:15	Smilex	Oh! Yeah I don't deinitialize or free my memory. I let the kernel take care of taht
2016-02-16 08:16:24	Ysblokje	for instance ;)
2016-02-16 08:16:26	Fenix2412	madmachinations, I think that you need a spliter but give me a sec I will ask my friend
2016-02-16 08:16:29	Ysblokje	I saw it in the code
2016-02-16 08:16:40	Ysblokje	but decided to let you find out for your self :D

2016-02-16 08:17:18	Ysblokje	why ?
2016-02-16 08:17:22	Ysblokje	its dirty
2016-02-16 08:17:25	madmachinations	Fenix2412: My headset is a combo connector, in theory it should just work. But when its plugged in my laptop refuses to recognise the microphone at all.
2016-02-16 08:17:31	Ysblokje	wipe your ass so to speak ;0
2016-02-16 08:17:33	gnarface	madmachinations: (i don't have one myself, but this seems to be a more and more common question lately)
2016-02-16 08:18:00	madmachinations	gnarface: I've tried that, it just keeps insisting the device is busy whenever I try and override any of the pins, it also crashes pulse audio.
2016-02-16 08:18:18	Fenix2412	madmachinations, oh ok
2016-02-16 08:18:28	Fenix2412	I was thinking it was just microphone

2016-02-16 08:18:55	Smilex	Ysblokje: Because more code is bad, and much worse than the nothing that happens from not cleaning up my resources
2016-02-16 08:19:11	Fenix2412	gnarface, well my friend is saying it's also tricky on windows to get it to work in combo mode
2016-02-16 08:19:16	madmachinations	Fenix2412: Unfortunately no lol, but thanks for trying to help all the same :)
2016-02-16 08:19:20	Ysblokje	Well returning in the middle of code is also ugly ;)
2016-02-16 08:19:46	Fenix2412	madmachinations, what is your laptop name?
2016-02-16 08:19:55	Smilex	Ysblokje: When the application closes, the kernel also cleanes up everything associated with it. I don't see why I should do that as well
2016-02-16 08:20:05	Smilex	Ysblokje: What?
2016-02-16 08:20:25	madmachinations	gnarface: I have a feeling its an alsa bug, its not a really new laptop, I think this model is a year or two old. Its an Acer ES1-111M
2016-02-16 08:20:39	gnarface	madmachinations: did you ask about this in #alsa?
2016-02-16 08:20:47	Ysblokje	set a retval followed by a break and clean your stuff before main exits
2016-02-16 08:21:06	DrMcCoy	Ah, yes, the "don't use early return, but instead keep nesting those ifs" mindset. I think that's pretty silly

2016-02-16 08:21:59	Ysblokje	because leaving memory in use for the kernel to clean up doesnt work on all OSes ?
2016-02-16 08:22:01	madmachinations	gnarface: I did not, I actually just stopped bothering after the last couple of hours of messing with it and ordered a usb sound card. But I am at least trying to figure out exactly where the problem is still, as it would be nice to have it working without 2 adapters between the headset and the laptop ;P
2016-02-16 08:22:24	Smilex	Ysblokje: No, but it works on the ones I'll be dealing with

2016-02-16 23:14:39	arnej_	I also read that from KDAB earlier today and now I'm hyped again :)

2016-02-16 23:50:41	mirv_	I'd be very surprised if vulkan was released before gdc
2016-02-16 23:50:58	Fenix2412	Hello
2016-02-16 23:51:09	mirv_	only mildly surprise if the bloody thing is unveiled at gdc
2016-02-16 23:51:15	mirv_	*surprised
2016-02-16 23:51:36	dnlbaines	I think it could, gives time for any driver updates etc to be released to support any launch titles
2016-02-16 23:52:28	tadzik	I'm still a naysayer
2016-02-16 23:52:44	tadzik	I still heard nothing more than rumours and people repeating those rumours as facts
2016-02-16 23:52:50	homerj	no, vulkan will be the future of things
2016-02-16 23:52:57	homerj	it's just how hardware works now

2016-02-16 23:56:24	homerj	mesa is an opengl implementation
2016-02-16 23:56:34	mirv_	remains to be seen if mesa will encompass vulkan as a sub-project or not
2016-02-16 23:56:51	Ysblokje	So when you're on MESA you're fucked once again?
2016-02-16 23:56:54	homerj	I'm sure there will be a couple competing implementations
2016-02-16 23:57:06	homerj	Ysblokje, you're thinking gallium

2016-02-16 23:57:18	*	Ysblokje wouldn't know ;)
2016-02-16 23:57:41	mirv_	theoretically, at release, there should be an intel driver to play with
2016-02-16 23:57:50	homerj	graphic stack looks like this.... mesa(opengl) -> galilum3d(talks to hardware) -> drivers
2016-02-16 23:58:13	homerj	that's why you replace mesa with galilum 9, and get d3d 9 support
2016-02-16 23:58:22	homerj	gallium doesn't care about apis
2016-02-16 23:58:32	homerj	you add another statetracker to it and get support for a new spi

2016-02-16 23:58:36	GolBot	homerj meant to say: you add another statetracker to it and get support for a new api
2016-02-16 23:59:12	homerj	it's confusing, because really OpenGL until now is the only real api in town
2016-02-16 23:59:22	Ysblokje	Ehm if gallium talks to hardware, what are the drivers for?
2016-02-16 23:59:38	homerj	gallium talks to the kernel drivers
2016-02-16 23:59:52	dnlbaines	Did AMD announce something about it today?
2016-02-16 23:59:52	dnlbaines	http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/20160216_743842.html?ref=rss

2016-02-16 23:59:57	homerj	like an abstration layer
2016-02-17 00:00:35	homerj	so for instance, it's not maintained anymore, but there used to be a glide statetracker
2016-02-17 00:00:40	Ysblokje	homerj,  I forgive you your error earlier ;)
2016-02-17 00:01:40	homerj	so if you used that, then any hardware gallium could talk to, would be accelerated glide
2016-02-17 00:01:57	homerj	it's why gallium 9 works well for wine
2016-02-17 00:02:21	homerj	but wine doesn't want to support it, because it's two different codepaths, one for gallium users, one for everyone else
2016-02-17 00:02:51	tadzik	. o O ( wine-nine )
2016-02-17 00:03:23	homerj	not to mention gallium is linux specific
2016-02-17 00:05:11	homerj	tadzik, yeah
2016-02-17 00:05:33	homerj	it kind of sucks for people wanting to use d3d9 in wine to need a fork, but there's a good reason to not support it
2016-02-17 00:06:47	homerj	although, with vulkan, I'd assume they WILL support that, and have later d3d support though a d3d11/d3d12->vulkan translation

2016-02-17 02:20:09	magamo	Is it known at this time what nvidia drivers that the Vulkan support was introduced?
2016-02-17 02:20:47	magamo	... That came out a tad bit disjointed.  Nvidia claims their drivers support Vulkan.  What version introduced that support, anyone know?
2016-02-17 02:21:13	@Samsai	the new beta driver
2016-02-17 02:21:24	@Samsai	356.something
2016-02-17 02:21:47	magamo	Looks like it was in Linux driver 355.xx
2016-02-17 02:22:21	stqn	that would be nice since it’s the only one I can use :)
2016-02-17 02:22:42	Raven67854	Samsai, It's not new its an older driver :p
2016-02-17 02:23:33	dnlbaines	So apparently only that one special release of 355 supports it
2016-02-17 02:23:44	dnlbaines	So if you have newer releases they dont actually have support

2016-02-17 03:51:38	Ysblokje	okay nvm
2016-02-17 03:51:43	linux_gamer	anyone has done a vulkan demo vid yet? xpander69?
2016-02-17 03:51:43	tadzik	because we got that awesome cross-platform graphics api now

2016-02-17 04:17:33	EddDeDuck	Getting sone grief for beter support on mesa than AMD closed source on XCOM 2 :(
2016-02-17 04:17:37	EddDeDuck	Can’t win
2016-02-17 04:18:08	tumocs	EddDeDuck using mesa is always a win
2016-02-17 04:18:50	EddDeDuck	It is the same for me, Mesa+AMD is a mess for most of my games. I hope this won't be the case for XCOM 2.
2016-02-17 04:18:55	FutureSuture	EddDeDuck, refer that joker to this IRC channel so he can be set straight.
2016-02-17 04:19:03	EddDeDuck	So do I get you right if you say that if at all you will only support AMD on Mesa but not on Crimson?
2016-02-17 04:19:04	EddDeDuck	Becaues for me this would mean that I either would have to switch all the time (all other games I own work *way* better on the prop. drivers) .
2016-02-17 04:19:37	magamo	Agreed.  Even though I'm pretty firmly in the camp of buying nvidia hardware for now, I'm always of the opinion that better support for open solutions is a great thing.

2016-02-17 04:21:39	EddDeDuck	He is also upset as he bought the game before the spec was released and is now saying “OK, but you have to understand that as customers, we should know whether AMD will be supported (and if so, on which drivers) or not before purchasing.”
2016-02-17 04:21:43	EddDeDuck	Shrug :)
2016-02-17 04:21:54	EddDeDuck	Hard to answer that one
2016-02-17 04:22:00	Ysblokje	He's got a point
2016-02-17 04:22:18	EddDeDuck	Well he has a point but that’s not what we did
2016-02-17 04:22:32	EddDeDuck	We didn’t annouce any spec until we could confirm what would be supported
2016-02-17 04:22:55	EddDeDuck	if you buy a game on pre order before any spec is annouced it’s hard to see what we could do
2016-02-17 04:23:04	Ysblokje	true
2016-02-17 04:23:16	magamo	Truth.  One of the reasons I don't preorder much.
2016-02-17 04:23:24	EddDeDuck	I mean we had no clue what the min spec would be, if we could support AMD or not
2016-02-17 04:23:33	EddDeDuck	what about Intel or Nvidia min spec
2016-02-17 04:23:43	Ysblokje	but my guess is that at least one month before the final release, you (and others) should have a pretty decent idea about the requirements right?

2016-02-17 04:24:03	EddDeDuck	Final min spec was signed off 48 hours prior to release :)

2016-02-17 04:26:57	EddDeDuck	Well I guess you could delay XCOM 2 on all platforms for a month ;)
2016-02-17 04:27:07	EddDeDuck	SO you can get the min spec earlier :)
2016-02-17 04:27:13	Ysblokje	neh
2016-02-17 04:28:00	Ysblokje	Well you could have released it (earlier) to testers.
2016-02-17 04:28:14	EddDeDuck	We have an internal QA team
2016-02-17 04:28:14	Ysblokje	But that was out the question I guess
2016-02-17 04:28:31	EddDeDuck	external testers are a sanity test on top of that
2016-02-17 04:28:50	EddDeDuck	External testers would not effect knowing the min spec to any real degree
2016-02-17 04:29:18	Ysblokje	So the QA only in the last 48 hours decided what was good enough? Sounds...weird..
2016-02-17 04:29:26	EddDeDuck	No
2016-02-17 04:29:37	EddDeDuck	In development there are these things called bugs… :)
2016-02-17 04:29:42	EddDeDuck	and these things called fixes....
2016-02-17 04:29:52	Ysblokje	Dont get me wrong, you guys do a really fine job.
2016-02-17 04:29:58	EddDeDuck	You do as many of the second to fix the first ones :)
2016-02-17 04:30:21	EddDeDuck	If you make a call 4 weeks before release then anything you do beyond that point doesn’t matter
2016-02-17 04:30:30	Ysblokje	I never produce bugs *cough*

2016-02-17 04:31:54	EddDeDuck	Basically when you’re on a tight deadline and your aiming at a moving target knowing what the min spec will be ahead of time is tricky.
2016-02-17 04:32:21	EddDeDuck	When you have a port of a game that has shipped already and you have a large window for release then it’s much easier to nnouce spec aheadc of time.

2016-02-17 04:35:07	EddDeDuck	when preload went live
2016-02-17 04:35:23	@Samsai	might be bad to say that as a dev though
2016-02-17 04:35:25	EddDeDuck	So you could still preorder bonus
2016-02-17 04:35:47	EddDeDuck	To be fair XCOM 2 is not a standard release
2016-02-17 04:36:01	DerRidda	There are refunds anyway, so even if somebody pre-orders and can't run it there's no harm done.
2016-02-17 04:36:30	EddDeDuck	It’s only a few poeple and it’s a hard problem to get 100% right
2016-02-17 04:37:00	EddDeDuck	no matter what you do it will be the wrong option for some people’s situation
2016-02-17 04:37:15	EddDeDuck	You just need to try and find the best overall choice
2016-02-17 04:37:20	@Samsai	indeed

2016-02-17 09:37:51	Yakumozo	The problem is that I see screen tearing during  for expample youtube videos, games or chrome site scrolling. I use Ubuntu Gnome 15.10 and updated my nvidia drivers to 316.28.

2016-02-17 12:29:06	gnarface	i know, its a complete joke now, but so was linux, not so long ago
2016-02-17 12:30:19	gnarface	give it another decade or so and i bet we'll see serious strides to abolish proprietary hardware entirely
2016-02-17 12:31:11	No1RL355	open software is easier to make than open hardware. Haiku, Kolibrios and other just-for-fun OS'es confirms it

2016-02-17 12:32:30	gnarface	yes, that's true, but open software also helps enable open hardware.  there's already an *almost* completely open laptop (but it sucks for gaming) and there's a purportedly completely open new server board project (mislabeled "workstation" IMO) based on i think POWER8 chips, actually backed by IMB

2016-02-17 12:59:37	Mneuro	Steam's download speeds are insane
2016-02-17 12:59:48	Mneuro	like either super fast or super slow
2016-02-17 13:00:57	gnarface	Mneuro: they use 3rd party CDNs, not all of which are very high quality.  its been recommended to me in the past (and proven to work fairly reliably) that if you can switch your download locale to somewhere else in the general region, you might have better luck, even if its further away (due to the fact that latency is not material to the download process)
2016-02-17 13:01:25	Mneuro	Hmm maybe I should try dallas
2016-02-17 13:01:41	gnarface	Mneuro: oh you're in the US too?  yes, try dallas.  the LA one is fucking garbage
2016-02-17 13:01:54	gnarface	Mneuro: not only is the LA one garbage, it will occasionally give you back corrupted save files
2016-02-17 13:01:55	Mneuro	I am currently using Minneapolis
2016-02-17 13:01:57	Mneuro	it seems like garbage
2016-02-17 13:02:21	gnarface	dallas seems to be (for now) the best US one
2016-02-17 13:02:28	Mneuro	it's like it caps out at 8.0MB/S
2016-02-17 13:02:37	Mneuro	my speed is 15.0MB/S
2016-02-17 13:03:25	gnarface	heh, well... since i'm in 3rd-world LA, my speed caps at 2MB/s but the LA one will still do worse than that.  definitely try dallas.  there's probably a good reason its the default setting for US accounts
2016-02-17 13:03:50	Mneuro	it's slowed down to around 2MB/sec
2016-02-17 13:03:53	Mneuro	:(
2016-02-17 13:04:30	Mneuro	did a speedtest, getting 125 KB/sec

2016-02-17 13:04:41	gnarface	KB/s??
2016-02-17 13:04:45	gnarface	maybe your problem is local

2016-02-17 13:05:54	gnarface	Mneuro: comcast throttles but NOT 3rd party speed tests.  they're not idiots
2016-02-17 13:06:00	Mneuro	wow seriously?
2016-02-17 13:06:15	gnarface	(though their helpdesk support staff might make it seem otherwise)
2016-02-17 13:06:31	Mneuro	I really hate comcast
2016-02-17 13:06:41	stqn	I can usually dl at 1MB/s from Steam, which is the best my line can do
2016-02-17 13:06:43	gnarface	Mneuro: yea, its flat out illegal.  they've been sued at least twice by the FCC but they always settle out of court
2016-02-17 13:06:45	Mneuro	I have another option but I would get charged way more for less internet
2016-02-17 13:07:55	gnarface	Mneuro: what you gotta decide is whether its still way more for less internet AFTER comcast starts throttling you (i think they throttle after 300GB of download in a month, and also they throttle anything encrypted down to like a pinhole stream.    then they have other obscure rules for how they throttle swarm-stream traffic like torrents and Blizzard Battle.net patching)

2016-02-17 13:09:18	stqn	there are honorable liars?
2016-02-17 13:09:34	gnarface	Mneuro: my current download caps at 2MB/s (not mb/s) but if i set my steam locale to dallas, i almost always actually GET it
2016-02-17 13:09:41	Mneuro	i would go from $80 for 150 megabits and 2000gb data cap to the other company being $130 for 50 megabits and no data cap
2016-02-17 13:09:42	gnarface	stqn: well, theoretically, yes
2016-02-17 13:10:41	Mneuro	Man, I hope Vulkan drivers release soon

2016-02-17 13:11:29	gnarface	Mneuro: just fyi, 2000GB/month is only 6mb/s (NOT MB/s)  how much have you downloaded so far this month? you could have just hit the cap.  this could be nothing to do with steam
2016-02-17 13:11:49	Mneuro	huh?  my cap does not affect my speed
2016-02-17 13:11:58	Mneuro	my speed is 150 megabits per second

2016-02-17 13:13:08	Mneuro	comcast's data cap is just the total amount of GB you are allowed to download per month before they charge you for additional GBs
2016-02-17 13:13:17	gnarface	Mneuro: i'm fairly clear that they throttle after the cap
2016-02-17 13:13:28	Mneuro	I went over last month, they didn't throttle me
2016-02-17 13:13:34	Mneuro	I only had a 1000gb cap
2016-02-17 13:13:38	Mneuro	i monitored it
2016-02-17 13:13:42	gnarface	they don't always police it very well
2016-02-17 13:13:46	gnarface	especially with new customers
2016-02-17 13:13:52	Mneuro	I should repeat, I'm not technically a comcast customer
2016-02-17 13:13:56	Mneuro	My ISP is mediacom
2016-02-17 13:13:59	Mneuro	a subsidiary of comcast
2016-02-17 13:14:13	gnarface	all that would mean is mediacom is powerless to help you if you complain
2016-02-17 13:14:56	gnarface	but i no longer feel sorry for you if you're only paying 80$/month and still getting 8MB/s
2016-02-17 13:15:17	Mneuro	outside of steam I get 15MB/s
2016-02-17 13:15:47	gnarface	i get 2MB/s its my flat out max, and at 98$/month its the cheapest, fastest no-cap hard line you can get in LA
2016-02-17 13:15:57	Mneuro	I don't know if I could live in LA
2016-02-17 13:15:58	gnarface	(in a residentially-zoned building, at least)
2016-02-17 13:15:59	Mneuro	it sounds horrible

2016-02-17 13:17:21	Mneuro	it's not huge, but not small
2016-02-17 13:17:34	gnarface	eh, that's kinda small actually, but if its +1500 i'm legitimately very jealous, at least in the summer when the weather isn't trying to kill you
2016-02-17 13:17:48	Mneuro	yea, winters are nasty here

2016-02-17 13:18:45	gnarface	yea, without roommates its difficult to pull off
2016-02-17 13:18:47	Mneuro	so more money in your paycheck
2016-02-17 13:18:53	gnarface	10% sales tax
2016-02-17 13:18:59	Mneuro	6% here
2016-02-17 13:19:07	gnarface	your gasoline is cheaper too
2016-02-17 13:19:21	Mneuro	its about 1.70 right now for gas here

2016-02-17 13:20:25	Mneuro	there aren't even 1 million people in the entirety of south dakota

2016-02-17 13:21:00	gnarface	the average commute here is maybe still half an hour an hour, but its rarely more than about 7 miles
2016-02-17 13:21:02	Mneuro	the whole town is only 2 or 3 miles
2016-02-17 13:21:18	Mneuro	i think i spend $20 every 2 weeks in gas
2016-02-17 13:21:31	gnarface	most people spend all their commute time basically waiting in line to get into downtown, hollywood, or santa monica

2016-02-17 13:23:17	Mneuro	Having tried a bunch of other distros, I really have a lot of respect for Xubuntu
2016-02-17 13:23:17		[13:23]
2016-02-17 13:23:26	Mneuro	They do a really amazing job
2016-02-17 13:24:09	gnarface	know what worked for me? trying a lot of different distros, then eventually going BACK to debian after i'd gotten really good at linux
2016-02-17 13:24:20	gnarface	then i gained a new appreciation for debian
2016-02-17 13:24:36	gnarface	of course that was before their maintainers were all replaced by evil alien bodysnatchers
2016-02-17 13:25:27	gnarface	i can't claim i know anything about xubuntu though
2016-02-17 13:28:09	Mneuro	I love debian
2016-02-17 13:28:24	Mneuro	I just don't use it
2016-02-17 13:30:19	gnarface	it can get a bit tedious if you need new stuff and quality control at the same time
2016-02-17 13:30:24	gnarface	since they don't seem to accomplish that
2016-02-17 13:30:46	gnarface	but i'm not convinced that ubuntu or any of the derivatives thereof have accomplished it either
2016-02-17 13:31:40	Mneuro	I used Debian Testing for a while
2016-02-17 13:31:41	gnarface	i've been frequently tempted to go back to slackware or gentoo lately, over the whole systemd fiasco, but devuan does so far seem to be showing promise
2016-02-17 13:31:52	Mneuro	It was definitely pretty stable, even thought it was testing
2016-02-17 13:32:17	Mneuro	The distro I "want" to use is Arch, but something always breaks during an update and I don't feel like spending all day fixing issues
2016-02-17 13:33:06	gnarface	*before* systemd i would have said to use debian unstable for gaming rigs, but keep frequent backups, and that debian stable is fine for headless servers, so long as you're competent enough to properly manually backport anything newer than they distribute yourself if you require it
2016-02-17 13:33:24	Mneuro	I don't think systemd affects me
2016-02-17 13:33:32	Mneuro	I don't do anything with it
2016-02-17 13:33:41	Mneuro	and so far it doesn't affect my xubuntu install
2016-02-17 13:34:14	gnarface	yea, re: arch, that's why i had to stop using gentoo.  i really WANTED to be able to make gentoo my only distro, but there were too often really hamfisted breakages that just represented utterly sloppy or non-existent QA; in the end i decided it was better to have old software with security patches than having to risk hosing your install on every update
2016-02-17 13:34:48	Mneuro	I know I shouldn't expect "stable" out of Arch updates, but arch users always claim that updates don't break their system
2016-02-17 13:34:56	Mneuro	but I have had my system break from updates twice on arch in the last year
2016-02-17 13:35:25	gnarface	its hard enough in life to find people capable of being truly honest with *themselves* much less strangers on IRC
2016-02-17 13:35:33	Mneuro	true
2016-02-17 13:36:22	gnarface	i really like the ideas behind arch
2016-02-17 13:36:41	Mneuro	me too, and I think pacman is worlds better than apt
2016-02-17 13:37:08	gnarface	i see it as a slightly saner, more vetran user's gentoo:  better adherence to using open tools already in the ecosystem than rolling their own stuff
2016-02-17 13:37:34	gnarface	but the whole "just suck everything in verbatim from upstream source" is just obviously not gonna help anyone get real work done
2016-02-17 13:38:01	gnarface	unless the "real work" you're trying to get done is testing alpha builds of every single piece of software you need
2016-02-17 13:38:10	Mneuro	I do really love the latest and greatest software, but the first time it gets in the way of me getting work done or just wanting to play a game on steam, i'm done
2016-02-17 13:38:41	gnarface	yea

2016-02-17 13:49:20	gnarface	1997 here
2016-02-17 13:49:43	gnarface	my only regret being that i didn't hear of it in 1992
2016-02-17 13:49:59	Mneuro	I had been interested in linux when I was using Windows XP around 2003 or 2004, but it wasn't until I bought a Vista laptop in 2007 that I was done with windows
2016-02-17 13:50:06	gnarface	also: windows-free since 2000
2016-02-17 13:50:14	Mneuro	unfortunately i'm not windows-free
2016-02-17 13:50:15	gnarface	(since the year 2000, not the windows version)
2016-02-17 13:50:17	Mneuro	we have a windows gaming machine
2016-02-17 13:50:20	Mneuro	hooked to our tv
2016-02-17 13:51:08	Mneuro	It wasn't supposed to be
2016-02-17 13:51:11	Mneuro	It's an alienware steam machine
2016-02-17 13:51:14	gnarface	heh, i'd heard people refer to windows vista as "windows: annoying edition"
2016-02-17 13:51:19	Mneuro	but SteamOS on the alienware machine is horrible
2016-02-17 13:51:33	gnarface	you should try installing debian on that machine
2016-02-17 13:51:46	Mneuro	i installed regular ubuntu and it was okay
2016-02-17 13:52:03	Mneuro	but my fiance wanted Witcher 3 and Dragon Age so windows it is
2016-02-17 13:52:37	gnarface	well, you gotta do what you gotta do
2016-02-17 13:53:05	Mneuro	yea, I bet it will have steamos on it again soon
2016-02-17 13:53:08	gnarface	i still buy stuff from Nintendo frequently
2016-02-17 13:53:13	Mneuro	Windows on a TV is horrible
2016-02-17 13:53:16	gnarface	so there is taint on my soul too
2016-02-17 13:54:07	Mneuro	I actually wish I didn't hate apple with a fiery passion
2016-02-17 13:54:07		[13:54]
2016-02-17 13:54:27	gnarface	nintendo is hardly a champion of fair usage rights or open software, but at least their Unity implementation works better than Linux's
2016-02-17 13:54:30	Mneuro	Then instead of windows I could probably just have a hackintosh
2016-02-17 13:55:44	Mneuro	I hope Vulkan makes steam machines a lot better
2016-02-17 13:55:54	gnarface	i was actually an Apple hater until the original OSX which made me change my mind 100% about them, unfortunately for them, after whatever the release was just after Jaguar, i quickly saw their "planned obsolescence" profit strategy and was quickly fed up with them again
2016-02-17 13:56:13	gnarface	i think its freaking hilarious that Vulkan is "cross-platform, except for Apple" lol
2016-02-17 13:56:21	gnarface	we'll see how that works
2016-02-17 13:57:16	gnarface	and all the iPhone remote-bricking crap
2016-02-17 13:57:20	gnarface	just sad really
2016-02-17 13:57:39	gnarface	i had a bunch of friends who are still apple fanatics to this day
2016-02-17 13:57:41	Mneuro	I admit I use an iPhone
2016-02-17 13:57:45	gnarface	emphasis on *had*
2016-02-17 13:57:48	Mneuro	I just switched from android this past weekend
2016-02-17 13:58:03	Mneuro	I couldn't take buggy android phones anymore
2016-02-17 13:58:03	gnarface	(though i didn't unfriend them all because of their continued loyalty to Apple, it *seems* to be just coincidence)
2016-02-17 13:58:56	gnarface	i'm still using a dumb phone with buttons
2016-02-17 13:59:13	gnarface	its frankly useless i'm just about to cancel it but i keep thinking my grandma might want to actually call me one day
2016-02-17 13:59:23	Mneuro	From my past experiences, android is far too buggy and battery hungry for me
2016-02-17 13:59:50	gnarface	nobody i actually want to talk to anymore can't reach me on my computer
2016-02-17 14:00:01	gnarface	so the phone is just about only used to pay its own bill
2016-02-17 14:00:09	Mneuro	my phone is mainly a podcast machine at work
2016-02-17 14:00:18	gnarface	or send the occasional SMS message when i'm trying to meet someone at a resturant and didn't plan carefully enough
2016-02-17 14:00:32	gnarface	i keep it largely just so if my car breaks down i can call AAA
2016-02-17 14:00:42	gnarface	but even then, its barely worth it
2016-02-17 14:00:48	gnarface	phones are dead tech
2016-02-17 14:01:01	Mneuro	Unfortunately in South Dakota you have to have a cell phone
2016-02-17 14:01:09	Mneuro	your car could break down 50 miles from the nearest town
2016-02-17 14:01:15	gnarface	oh yea, i know all about it

2016-02-17 14:01:36	gnarface	you don't want to be 50 miles outside of town in winter when you could freeze to death before the next person drives by
2016-02-17 14:01:42	Mneuro	and since I only pay $45 for unlimited talk/text and data (first 5GB at LTE speeds) I can't complain
2016-02-17 14:01:48	Mneuro	it makes an amazing podcast machine
2016-02-17 14:04:25	gnarface	maybe i'd like my phone more if i did any podcasts
2016-02-17 14:05:28	gnarface	due to my usage patterns, i bought the phone best for sending text messages (hint: qwerty keyboard, real buttons, NO TOUCHSCREEN)
2016-02-17 14:05:54	Mneuro	that definitely makes sense
2016-02-17 14:08:14	gnarface	mostly anyone i talk to at length in voice that i can't meet in person locally just connects to my mumble server
2016-02-17 14:08:31	gnarface	on average i use about 3 minutes of voice to pay the phone's own bill
2016-02-17 14:09:04	gnarface	and maybe 50-100 SMS messages to other people's phones who connect their IM clients to their phones, when i'm away from my computer and can't IM them from it directly
2016-02-17 14:09:56	gnarface	(working from home makes this all much easier)
2016-02-17 14:09:56		[14:09]
2016-02-17 14:10:22	gnarface	but like i said, i still keep it in case i'm ever driving somewhere and need to call AAA cause my car broke down, or if Grandma wants to reach me
2016-02-17 14:11:00	gnarface	or you know, *occasionally* still (more and more rare) you might have a client who will be insulted if you don't give them your phone number
2016-02-17 14:11:18	gnarface	so rarely, but sometimes its good to have a phone number
2016-02-17 14:11:25	Mneuro	yea
2016-02-17 14:11:33	Mneuro	it's a necessary evil right now
2016-02-17 14:11:35	gnarface	i think phone numbers will die out completely in our lifetimes though
2016-02-17 14:11:40	Mneuro	I probably won't have a phone in the next year or two
2016-02-17 14:12:19	gnarface	i think phones will remain, but the whole phone call routing stuff is just primitive and not really necessary
2016-02-17 14:12:33	gnarface	its redundant to current internet technology
2016-02-17 14:13:49	gnarface	the concept that internet tech is less reliable is less of a physical fact and more just anecdotal incidents based on the fact we so far haven't put the same reliability regulations on "internet" services that we previously did on the phone carriers
2016-02-17 14:14:12	gnarface	there's no practical reason for it anyway either
2016-02-17 14:14:22	gnarface	i think ISPs should be classified as common carriers
2016-02-17 14:14:34	gnarface	and regulated like city water and electricity
2016-02-17 14:14:36	Mneuro	definitely
2016-02-17 14:15:47	gnarface	the problems with most big ISPs today getting away with such misbehaviors as Comcast et al, is that they assume all the RIGHTS of common carriers, without any of the RESTRICTIONS
2016-02-17 14:16:47	gnarface	the law clearly states they CAN'T have it both ways
2016-02-17 14:16:59	 < 	Marezz (~Marezz@unaffiliated/marezz) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-17 14:17:10	gnarface	but ... for some reason they've already accumulated enough money to seemingly bully the FCC around instead of just having to suck it up and do their jobs right
2016-02-17 14:17:26	Mneuro	it's because Mediacom is too large
2016-02-17 14:17:27	gnarface	am i bitter about this? hell yes
2016-02-17 14:17:29	Mneuro	err, comcast
2016-02-17 14:18:35	gnarface	well, its not just mediacom
2016-02-17 14:18:41	gnarface	there's a handful of very bad players
2016-02-17 14:18:58	gnarface	but unfortunately they're also the ones who effectively have monopolies in the largest amount of US territory
2016-02-17 14:19:02	Mneuro	wow, retroarch added vulkan to it's backend today
2016-02-17 14:19:24	gnarface	and the worst ones started as *cable* companies, which adds insult to injury, because those networks were NEVER designed for data
2016-02-17 14:19:37	gnarface	well, not that the old copper wires were either, strictly speaking
2016-02-17 14:19:54	gnarface	but coax networks represent an additional security issue at the physical level

2016-02-17 14:21:13	Mneuro	So it feels a bit dirt but I'm not using wine for 2 windows games
2016-02-17 14:21:20	Mneuro	the only 2 I really needed from my windows days
2016-02-17 14:21:31	 > 	Marezz (~Marezz@unaffiliated/marezz) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-02-17 14:21:34	Mneuro	Everquest and League of Legends
2016-02-17 14:21:39	Mneuro	both run flawlessly
2016-02-17 14:21:56	gnarface	hmm. yea the very popular stuff is generally pretty well supported in wine
2016-02-17 14:22:21	gnarface	not sure about "flawlessly" but usually you can get like 90% of the high-quality graphics with only about a 50-75% hit to your framerates
2016-02-17 14:22:24	Mneuro	I had basically given up on wine a few years ago
2016-02-17 14:23:22	gnarface	its a big mess but they're really doing about as well as they possibly can while dodging legal restrictions
2016-02-17 14:24:06	gnarface	microsoft's eula on directx for example makes it nearly impossible for anyone who actually knows shit about directx to contribute to wine
2016-02-17 14:24:23	gnarface	it literally legally *has* to only be made from code written by people who don't know what the fuck they're doing
2016-02-17 14:24:35	gnarface	considering that, it works AMAZINGLY well
2016-02-17 14:24:46	Mneuro	yea i'm surprised with these 2 games
2016-02-17 14:24:50	Mneuro	I'm not sure that I'll try any others
2016-02-17 14:24:57	Mneuro	on Steam, if it's not linux native I don't bother
2016-02-17 14:24:57		[14:24]
2016-02-17 14:25:38	gnarface	where there is a will there is a way, the very popular stuff works pretty well in wine through sheer brute force and reverse engineering, but only for while its actually popular enough that the developers can keep getting bug reports from actual users
2016-02-17 14:26:21	 > 	mETz (~DermETz@port-25074.pppoe.wtnet.de) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-02-17 14:26:57	gnarface	so while current games like EQ, LoL, WoW, SC2, D3, etc, still work, games from just 5-10 years ago often stopped working the year later, and getting them working in wine requires actually USING the wine version from that long ago
2016-02-17 14:27:21	gnarface	for wine to work for everything, it relies on users contributing good bug reports
2016-02-17 14:27:30	Mneuro	I like playonlinux
2016-02-17 14:27:33	gnarface	as soon as a game stops being played, regressions creep in
2016-02-17 14:27:39	Mneuro	it basically let's you pick a version of wine that is known to work
2016-02-17 14:27:50	gnarface	yea, playonlinux seems like the right idea, i just wish they could pull their job off without introducing MORE bugs
2016-02-17 14:28:08	Mneuro	it made LoL a one click install
2016-02-17 14:28:08	gnarface	maybe they've gotten better lately
2016-02-17 14:28:12	Mneuro	I was impressed
2016-02-17 14:28:35	Marezz	gnarface, do you know to troubleshoot kernel panics? xD
2016-02-17 14:28:43	gnarface	i do admit i've had to learn *WAY* too much about wine just to play games
2016-02-17 14:28:52	gnarface	Marezz: occasionally, pastebin it?
2016-02-17 14:29:05	Marezz	gnarface, I cant, it wont let me xD http://i.imgur.com/6iRwY0U.jpg
2016-02-17 14:29:05	GolBot	[ jpeg (3264 x 2448) ]
2016-02-17 14:29:14	gnarface	Marezz: there's only a small set of things that can cause a kernel panic
2016-02-17 14:30:08	gnarface	Marezz: i'd put my money on your initrd.img not having your filesystem driver in it, or you forgot to load your initrd.img with your new grub config
2016-02-17 14:30:39	gnarface	Marezz: "unable to mount root fs" is pretty conclusive in that regard; but its possible your'e just pointing it at the wrong partition too
2016-02-17 14:30:43	Marezz	gnarface, probably grub, since i had to install and use grub 2
2016-02-17 14:30:56	Marezz	could not find a solution to add windows to its menu for dualboot
2016-02-17 14:31:22	gnarface	Marezz: there's a way but last time i had to do it was in lilo, for windows 95.  i'm sure its changed since then
2016-02-17 14:31:32	Marezz	heheh
2016-02-17 14:32:11	gnarface	Marezz: keep that image handy, try to get help from the grub people maybe?
2016-02-17 14:32:12	Marezz	sigh, source distros arent all that what ppl say >.< it seems im a binary person after all :D
2016-02-17 14:32:23	Marezz	its going to get wiped
2016-02-17 14:32:36	gnarface	Marezz: noooo!!!!
2016-02-17 14:32:41	gnarface	Marezz: don't panic and wipe it!
2016-02-17 14:33:12	gnarface	Marezz: go into #grub and try to get help, probably this is a very simple grub or initrd.img misconfiguration you can fix easily i just don't know how myself
2016-02-17 14:33:19	Marezz	but what am i supposed to do with it? i cant boot my os..
2016-02-17 14:33:34	gnarface	Marezz: well you're in IRC now, you can probably repair it
2016-02-17 14:33:53	gnarface	Marezz: you can repair it with a livecd/usb image
2016-02-17 14:33:59	Marezz	oh
2016-02-17 14:34:39	gnarface	Marezz: in the future, you can avoid this type of problem by statically compiling your root filesystem driver into the kernel instead of loading it as a module, in the old days that's what i'd do.  eventually i just learned to avoid making a mess...
2016-02-17 14:35:15	gnarface	Marezz: in the old days, i'd always make sure 3 drivers were NOT modules: 1) ethernet 2) filesystem 3) soundcard
2016-02-17 14:35:18	Marezz	gnarface, well its a precompiled debian kernel that they have in funtoo so ppl can get going
2016-02-17 14:35:48	gnarface	Marezz: i know.  so maybe you just messed up one line in the grub config and forgot to load the initrd.img, or maybe you forgot to update the initrd.img with the new kernel's drivers?
2016-02-17 14:36:40	Marezz	Well I dont remember doing that last time and it worked without problems
2016-02-17 14:36:45	gnarface	Marezz: or maybe you messed up the grub line that tells it what partition to try to boot from; i see you have it set to block (0,0) ... that could very well be wrong.  you have to get those numbers right, the ones in parenthesis
2016-02-17 14:36:54	Marezz	it probably is grub related since i didnt use grub 2 last time
2016-02-17 14:37:04	gnarface	Marezz: well i wasn't watching what you did, so i can only speculate
2016-02-17 14:37:28	gnarface	Marezz: next time you do something this crazy, you should livestream it to hitbox.tv then i can stop you before you make any gratuitous errors :-(
2016-02-17 14:37:36	Marezz	i had someone help me with manual grub boot entry config last time so i did it manually. this time it was grub 2 with os prober
2016-02-17 14:37:56	gnarface	Marezz: i fucking HATE grub2
2016-02-17 14:38:00	Marezz	are you a gentoo person? or just debian?
2016-02-17 14:38:07	Marezz	well now i hate it as well lol :)
2016-02-17 14:38:28	gnarface	Marezz: mostly debian/devuan; haven't used gentoo since about 2007 or 2008 i think, but grub2 should be the same everwhere
2016-02-17 14:38:48	gnarface	Marezz: what's probably different is the tools you use to make the initrd.img and the kernel
2016-02-17 14:39:06	Marezz	What's your honest opinion on source distros? Are they worth the hassle?
2016-02-17 14:40:08	gnarface	no
2016-02-17 14:40:08		[14:40]
2016-02-17 14:40:56	gnarface	i mean, yes, if you want to learn alot about linux real fast the hard way by breaking stuff and having to start over alot
2016-02-17 14:41:30	gnarface	but its the equivalent to trying to teach a 5-year-old to swim by throwing them into the deep end of an olympic swimming pool and then laughing while they thrash around and almost drown themselves
2016-02-17 14:42:04	gnarface	i don't sense from you that you have that much willpower
2016-02-17 14:42:08	gnarface	and frankly i don't either
2016-02-17 14:42:15	gnarface	or i'd still be using gentoo
2016-02-17 14:42:36	Marezz	debian/devuan is just so much easier, im used to apt-get :(
2016-02-17 14:42:50	gnarface	but for example if i was hired to teach a CLASS on linux, i'd pick a source distro like arch or gentoo for sure
2016-02-17 14:42:51	Marezz	but i hate that it comes with alot of stupidly packaged packages >.<
2016-02-17 14:43:22	Mneuro	Alien: Isolation is so good, but it makes me want to cry in a corner
2016-02-17 14:43:42	gnarface	haha, that's quite an endorsement, Mneuro
2016-02-17 14:44:01	Mneuro	when you can see the save point but the alien pops out
2016-02-17 14:44:09	Mneuro	it makes you want to cry
2016-02-17 14:46:42	Mneuro	So alcoholic root beer is pretty amazing
2016-02-17 14:46:49	Mneuro	i don't drink often but this is pretty good
2016-02-17 14:46:50	gnarface	Marezz: maybe grub or arch's IRC channels can help you.  don't panic and delete it all yet
2016-02-17 14:47:00	Marezz	well 5am, i hate not being able to sleep properly. going to try and get some rest
2016-02-17 14:47:07	gnarface	time for me to get some dinner
2016-02-17 14:47:09	Marezz	gnarface, thanks for the help bud, see you tomorrow
2016-02-17 14:47:11	gnarface	peace out y'll

2016-02-17 19:46:06	EddDeDuck	So much Vulkan to read
2016-02-17 19:46:15	EddDeDuck	600 pages of spec
2016-02-17 19:46:35	EddDeDuck	That said it’s pretty much very similar to AMD’s Mantle
2016-02-17 19:46:41	gnarface	i'm still expecting them to scrap it entirely before the end of the year and say "woops"
2016-02-17 19:47:51	gnarface	basically

2016-02-17 19:53:11	@Samsai	i just don't see them scrapping the spec at all

2016-02-17 19:57:39	@Samsai	what are you citing as your source for these performance issues?

2016-02-17 19:57:42	@Samsai	talos principle?
2016-02-17 19:58:12	gnarface	i'm not citing any sources, but if either one had any chance of success at anything other than being a momentary distraction, Microsoft would have already sued them
2016-02-17 19:59:32	@Samsai	so... you are saying that vulkan has no chance because if it had microsoft would sue them for creating a new rendering API?
2016-02-17 19:59:46	@Samsai	hmm... that explains why the consoles rely on opengl and directx
2016-02-17 19:59:51	@Samsai	oh wait
2016-02-17 20:00:10	gnarface	what you've got to separate from reality is how much you WANT it to succeed
2016-02-17 20:00:48	@Samsai	i simply don't see a reason for it to not succeed
2016-02-17 20:00:50	@NaughtySquid	phoronix is still claiming he has insider info on a game
2016-02-17 20:00:51	@NaughtySquid	<_<
2016-02-17 20:01:17	gnarface	Samsai: i'll say it again, I WANT TO BE WRONG ABOUT THIS, but i'm not holding my breath this time.  i'm too old and tired.  i've seen this game too many times
2016-02-17 20:01:42	@Samsai	well, i suppose a pessimist is never disappointed
2016-02-17 20:01:53	@Samsai	but they also have a shorter life expectancy so that's also a thing
2016-02-17 20:02:02	@NaughtySquid	wow the tinfoil hats are out already about Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:02:16	gnarface	Samsai: lol, you'd think that, but you'd be surprised
2016-02-17 20:02:16	EddDeDuck	I was saying people need to dial back on the hype train
2016-02-17 20:02:27	@NaughtySquid	failure to deliver on performance? if you're on about talos benchmark, the developers said it themselves they haven't even done multi-threading in it
2016-02-17 20:02:43	@NaughtySquid	they aren't excluding os x either, apple didnt want it?
2016-02-17 20:02:50	EddDeDuck	Vulkan is defintely a better base than GL if you want low level perfomance for AAA titles but it’s still damn complex so will take time to shake out
2016-02-17 20:02:59	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-02-17 20:03:06	EddDeDuck	Drivers are jjst about working nothing more
2016-02-17 20:03:07	@NaughtySquid	like everything new, takes time
2016-02-17 20:03:26	EddDeDuck	spec is just about sighed off (but has loads of quetsions, holes etc that wil need filling in over time)
2016-02-17 20:03:27	@NaughtySquid	also
2016-02-17 20:03:33	@Samsai	i believe i have my hype under control
2016-02-17 20:03:35	@NaughtySquid	i think phoronix is confused about what gol does
2016-02-17 20:03:37	*	gnarface tries to be as pessimistic as physically possible, but somehow frequently still gets disappointed 
2016-02-17 20:04:03	@Samsai	but i am also not willing to simply call vulkan DOA on day 2 without a single reason to believe it is
2016-02-17 20:04:18	gnarface	Samsai: for me its about patterns
2016-02-17 20:04:23	EddDeDuck	Also more importantly Vulcan isn’t always faster than GL just like DX12 isn’t always faster than DX9
2016-02-17 20:04:28	@NaughtySquid	"Or in looking at your site today, all your Vulkan coverage seems to be well after the fact. " - phoronix about gol
2016-02-17 20:04:39	@NaughtySquid	it's not a race for gol for advert revenue heh
2016-02-17 20:04:58	@NaughtySquid	"My track record over the past 12 years pretty much shows I do get the job done with rather high accuracy while not everyone may agree with my tactics / methods" - because his tactics are often baiting and lying
2016-02-17 20:04:59	@Samsai	EddDeDuck, in optimal scenarios that is absolutely correct
2016-02-17 20:05:20	gnarface	Samsai: me, pronouncing Vulkan DOA would not be as easy if i'd been born the day before it was released.  a large part of my opinion is based on previous, unrelated, but statistically relevant events
2016-02-17 20:05:36	EddDeDuck	Vulcan has potentially improvemnts in the area of CPU usage
2016-02-17 20:06:00	EddDeDuck	It also by virtue of being newer has less legacy code and is designed wiht more modern architure in mind
2016-02-17 20:06:10	gnarface	nah they'll never let it actually save cpu cycles; that would inhibit new cpu sales
2016-02-17 20:06:25	gnarface	they'll be bribed by intel to stop that shit s.t.a.t.
2016-02-17 20:06:31	sigz	vulKan
2016-02-17 20:06:31		[20:06]
2016-02-17 20:06:31	@Samsai	gnarface, then dx12 would have never been made
2016-02-17 20:06:32	EddDeDuck	It will save CPU cycles for sure gnarface
2016-02-17 20:06:44	EddDeDuck	Because game devs will then use them all on beter physics, AI etc
2016-02-17 20:06:55	sigz	Edd you really don't like the K :p
2016-02-17 20:07:08	sigz	I already saw you a couple of times about this
2016-02-17 20:07:18	@NaughtySquid	gnarface: it has all ready been shown to save on cpu, intel even demod that fact
2016-02-17 20:07:20	EddDeDuck	Habit and autocorrect :p
2016-02-17 20:07:28	sebbu	after my new laptop, the bottleneck became the internet connection :( :'(
2016-02-17 20:07:33	EddDeDuck	As soon as you say we saved 20% CPU a game dev will say cool we can use that for XXX instead
2016-02-17 20:07:35	@Samsai	AMD also want to push these new APIs
2016-02-17 20:07:38	EddDeDuck	I know we do :)
2016-02-17 20:07:43	@Samsai	because they rely more on multi-core performance
2016-02-17 20:09:11	@NaughtySquid	i dunno why i bother commenting on phoronix forum
2016-02-17 20:09:22	@NaughtySquid	the guy is full of shit and will never change his tactics
2016-02-17 20:09:40	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, just yesterday you said you'd stop :P
2016-02-17 20:09:49	@NaughtySquid	until he pulled more shit Samsai
2016-02-17 20:09:52	EddDeDuck	I’d just walk away and take the high road
2016-02-17 20:10:01	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: sometimes i just can't :P
2016-02-17 20:10:13	EddDeDuck	I know it’s easy to get draw into a debate I can be guilty myself
2016-02-17 20:10:17	FutureSuture	EddDeDuck went from Vulkan to Vulcan and back to Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:10:34	EddDeDuck	but like Moon Hoaxers sometimes people don’t want to see the truth
2016-02-17 20:10:50	FutureSuture	What's a moon hoaxer?
2016-02-17 20:10:56	@NaughtySquid	just people claiming them have "secret anonymous sources" really fucks me off, when all they do is include info from SteamDB and don't even link to it
2016-02-17 20:11:00	gnarface	if this was Vegas, i'd be putting my $50 on vulkan and mantle both failing utterly, just for the record.  but again, WOULD like to be wrong
2016-02-17 20:11:03	@Samsai	FutureSuture, they believe man never made it to moon
2016-02-17 20:11:08	@NaughtySquid	he's so scared of losing visitors he wont even link to steamdb
2016-02-17 20:11:09	*	pdq thinks the moon is made of cheese
2016-02-17 20:11:15	FutureSuture	Ah, so that's the term used for such people
2016-02-17 20:11:34	*	FutureSuture thinks pdq is made of cheese.
2016-02-17 20:11:40	pdq	mmm
2016-02-17 20:11:52	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture is still arguing on the steam forums i see :P
2016-02-17 20:12:01	@NaughtySquid	we all have a place we like to argue heh
2016-02-17 20:12:03	EddDeDuck	I don’t think Vulkan will fail but I do think it won’t suplant DX12 as the weapon of choice for most AAA developers in the short term.
2016-02-17 20:12:16	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, yea, I do it every couple of weeks. Guy is a massive hypocrite.
2016-02-17 20:12:34	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: happens, im the same with phoronix :P
2016-02-17 20:12:42	pdq	i've been on the vulkan hype train since august 2014 :P
2016-02-17 20:12:46	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, you argue with Michael?
2016-02-17 20:12:54	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: all the time

2016-02-17 20:13:12	@NaughtySquid	see the gif, perfection
2016-02-17 20:13:12	FutureSuture	NaughtySquid, yea, you call him out, but does he talk back?
2016-02-17 20:13:17	@NaughtySquid	FutureSuture: he did this time
2016-02-17 20:13:18	@NaughtySquid	:D
2016-02-17 20:13:23	EddDeDuck	^^ get some popcorn
2016-02-17 20:13:23	@NaughtySquid	i finally baited him into reply to me
2016-02-17 20:13:24	FutureSuture	That gif xDDDDDD
2016-02-17 20:13:26	@NaughtySquid	and it's hilarious
2016-02-17 20:13:52	pdq	if it's a secret why is not a secret
2016-02-17 20:14:23	@NaughtySquid	pdq: he claims to have insider info on tomb raider from an anon source, then mentions steamdb and that's all he did, didn't even link to steamdbn

2016-02-17 20:14:36	@NaughtySquid	hilarious really
2016-02-17 20:14:42	gnarface	OH wait INTEL says Vulkan will save cpu cycles????! come on guys.
2016-02-17 20:14:50	gnarface	you can't be THAT naive
2016-02-17 20:15:18	EddDeDuck	The fact Vulcan saves CPU is pretty much fact
2016-02-17 20:15:40	EddDeDuck	Just like DX12, some of the high end Nvidia stuff in 4.5 AZO etc
2016-02-17 20:15:54	EddDeDuck	It’s basically removing driver overhead (which saves CPU cyles)
2016-02-17 20:16:14	EddDeDuck	However as always the catch is coding in a way that takes advatange of this and gains performance
2016-02-17 20:16:23	sebbu	gnarface, and it'll make internet faster =)
2016-02-17 20:16:44	@Samsai	well, you can always write in a way that wastes CPU cycles
2016-02-17 20:16:48	sebbu	maybe my ping will go under 200ms
2016-02-17 20:16:50	EddDeDuck	Not a free lunch more a if you work very hard you can how get a beter solution than before kinda thing
2016-02-17 20:16:59	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: well its not just removing overhead, its the multi-threading which OpenGL just doesn't do right?
2016-02-17 20:17:17	EddDeDuck	We’ve had MT GL for years on Apple it’s more than just that
2016-02-17 20:17:24	EddDeDuck	It’s about rmeoving dirver sync points
2016-02-17 20:17:29	@NaughtySquid	on apple yeah, not Linux :P
2016-02-17 20:17:48	sigz	does the nvidia driver 361.28 supports vulkan ? ( nvidia published the 355 compatible driver, don't know if they included it in following releases )
2016-02-17 20:17:49	@Samsai	well, nvidia has some multithreading in their opengl driver
2016-02-17 20:18:07	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: which only works in specific games and has to be manually enabled though remember
2016-02-17 20:18:11	@NaughtySquid	some games it makes worse
2016-02-17 20:18:18	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, that is true
2016-02-17 20:18:50	@NaughtySquid	which is a specific reason why Vulkan is better than OpenGL, it's one of the reasons it was made after all
2016-02-17 20:19:11	pdq	maximum performance graphics
2016-02-17 20:19:48	pdq	^^ i said that in coming attractions movie voice by the way
2016-02-17 20:20:29	@Samsai	hopefully talos devs optimize the renderer a little and bring it to linux soon
2016-02-17 20:20:49	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: well, it will be more interesting when they add in more multi-threading
2016-02-17 20:20:52	*	gnarface just waits for the other shoe to drop and you all find out that to get "maximum use" of Vulkan you all have to buy the new as-yet-to-be-released Intel CPU, maybe they'll call it the i8 just for fun
2016-02-17 20:20:57	@NaughtySquid	then we will see what Vulkan can do
2016-02-17 20:21:00	@Samsai	it's worth noting however that even in its current non-multithreaded state it beats opengl
2016-02-17 20:21:05	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-02-17 20:21:09	@NaughtySquid	that's quite important
2016-02-17 20:23:21	pdq	i wonder if dota 2 will be 1st game to actually utilize it since steamdb has that dota2 vulkan id
2016-02-17 20:23:21		[20:23]
2016-02-17 20:23:39	pdq	like not just use it like talos did
2016-02-17 20:23:54	@Samsai	i would say it's quite likely
2016-02-17 20:24:32	@NaughtySquid	to use what pdq? since Talos already uses Vulkan it has beat everyone :P
2016-02-17 20:24:45	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, runs slower than dx11
2016-02-17 20:24:55	pdq	it doesn't utilize the multi threading etc or any of the features, it is 'just working so far'
2016-02-17 20:25:16	pdq	yeah which still beats opengl in the benchmarks whic his cool
2016-02-17 20:25:47	@NaughtySquid	considering they have the basics down
2016-02-17 20:25:53	@NaughtySquid	i imagine it will do it fully before others
2016-02-17 20:26:08	@NaughtySquid	valve will probably wait for it to be in stable drivers
2016-02-17 20:26:16	@Samsai	hmm, i don't think so
2016-02-17 20:26:19	@NaughtySquid	since dota 2 is such a big game for them
2016-02-17 20:26:27	@Samsai	i think valve wants to put out as much vulkan stuff in as short time as possible
2016-02-17 20:26:40	pdq	maybe another beta or a new option in video settings?
2016-02-17 20:26:45	@Samsai	especially stuff that showcases vulkan's potential
2016-02-17 20:27:01	pdq	my fav game is csgo for sure that's waht i'm looking forward to, source2 and vulkan :]
2016-02-17 20:27:42	EddDeDuck	Basica understanding / overview
2016-02-17 20:27:43	EddDeDuck	OpenGL - higher level so a little less optmisation possible but you gain boosts from driver improvements and new hardware
2016-02-17 20:27:43	EddDeDuck	Vulkan - Lower level so much more potential for performance but easier to make mistakes, also new hardware will require the game to be reoptimsed per hardware as the drivers no longer do this for you.
2016-02-17 20:27:59	JayVii	i agree. Valve might put out an opt-in Beta for Dota2-Vulkan
2016-02-17 20:28:04	JayVii	that would be cool
2016-02-17 20:28:28	pdq	i wish i liked dota as much as csgo but still very cool yeah, i jealous of their source 2

2016-02-17 20:29:23	@NaughtySquid	more talos vulkan info
2016-02-17 20:29:24	JayVii	i always wondered, why the Windowsversions of Valve games remain directX, when all of valve's benchmarks show that OpenGL performs better for their games (for example L4D2)
2016-02-17 20:30:29	pdq	i thoguht they still use dx to opengl wrapper for all their games
2016-02-17 20:30:43	@NaughtySquid	pdq: dota 2 is native opengl
2016-02-17 20:31:01	pdq	but only now cause of soruce 2 ?
2016-02-17 20:31:04	pdq	source 2
2016-02-17 20:31:31	pdq	source and all gld src still use the togl?
2016-02-17 20:31:49	@NaughtySquid	yes
2016-02-17 20:32:00	 - 	saiGone is now known as sairuk
2016-02-17 20:32:05	@NaughtySquid	performance in dota 2 is much better now with native opengl too
2016-02-17 20:32:10	pdq	i can't wait for all their games to be native source 2/opengl/vulkan :)
2016-02-17 20:32:31	pdq	yeah, it seems like it is coming along
2016-02-17 20:34:51	JayVii	yeah. Dota2 now performs reasonably well on my crappy old GPU even with free drivers
2016-02-17 20:35:11	JayVii	i pretty much get the same performance as i would with Catalyst
2016-02-17 20:35:19	pdq	sweet
2016-02-17 20:35:22	JayVii	which is kinda odd, but i'm not complaining
2016-02-17 20:36:42	frankyboy_	JayVii, you mean that redist folder?
2016-02-17 20:37:30	JayVii	sorry?

2016-02-18 09:57:37	gnarface	stqn: that supports my theory actually
2016-02-18 09:58:04	stqn	it doesn’t use sdl2 though, or loads it dynamically

2016-02-18 09:58:29	gnarface	stqn: well my theory may actually be valid for other libraries besides SDL2

2016-02-18 09:59:08	stqn	I’m tired of these libs issues… the system linux uses doesn’t work for binary distribution
2016-02-18 09:59:19	gnarface	stqn: basically, steam is sticking its own version of some library in there, but its not compatible with the rest of your system.  when you run the game from the terminal, the proper version of that library that is distributed with your distro gets loaded instead of whatever junk steamos version steam put in
2016-02-18 09:59:24	stqn	nobody understands what’s going on
2016-02-18 09:59:52	stqn	sure.
2016-02-18 10:00:08	stqn	but some unity games still work, many other games still work
2016-02-18 10:00:34	gnarface	right, because many of those developers actually ARE smart enough to bypass steam's library and bundle their OWN that's more generally compatible

2016-02-18 10:00:54	stqn	hm maybe, although for unity games I doubt that :]
2016-02-18 10:01:08	gnarface	in either case, if you can figure out which library it is, you can just force its use instead from the steam launcher with LD_PRELOAD

2016-02-18 10:03:50	gnarface	stqn: for example, when bioshock infinite broke for me a while back due to steam's libsdl2 being updated and bioshock infinite not being packaged with its own yet, putting this in my steam launcher options fixed it for me, by forcing bioshock infinite to use the debian version instead: LD_PRELOAD="/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libSDL2-2.0.so.0.2.0" %command%
2016-02-18 10:04:40	gnarface	stqn: afterwards i went through all my other games to try to figure out why they worked when BI didn't, and i discovered that unlike BI, the developers of all the *other* games had already anticipated steam's broken libsdl2 and put their OWN version in with the game data itself
2016-02-18 10:05:43	gnarface	stqn: i'd bet this is the exact same situation your'e in right now - maybe the exact library isn't libsdl2, but it could be, and either way the breakage is probably formulaically similar to fix,
2016-02-18 10:07:00	stqn	interesting
2016-02-18 10:07:34	stqn	too bad finding the culprit is so tedious
2016-02-18 10:07:45	gnarface	stqn: i also required the exact same fix for Battleblock Theater.  the steam client's default was version 0.2.1, which was a version that only worked on ubuntu
2016-02-18 10:08:12	gnarface	stqn: i'd say its worth a gamble to try this yourself on your game, it can't hurt
2016-02-18 10:08:12		[10:08]
2016-02-18 10:08:33	stqn	I’m also tired of the steam games being hidden is such a layer of subdirectories :p
2016-02-18 10:08:49	gnarface	stqn: figure out which sdl2 version your distro is using, and ld_preload it like i did, there's a good chance it'll turn out to be a lucky guess

2016-02-18 10:09:29	gnarface	stqn: yes i don't like the nightmarish mess the steam client's subdirectory structures are either
2016-02-18 10:10:49	stqn	quick check: yes, paint it back, a unity game that works, uses ld_library_path to use its own libs

2016-02-18 10:11:53	stqn	but the hive doesn’t either, and yet works
2016-02-18 10:12:07	gnarface	stqn: yea, the situation as i gathered it after WEEKS of pulling teeth with the support staff of various porters is that valve has their own library versions in the steam client that are separate from the distro's versions which they offer for "maximum compatibility" and heavily encourage all the developers to rely on, but most the developers have discovered its all a lie and have learned to bundle their own
2016-02-18 10:12:33	gnarface	sometimes the steam client versions work, sometimes they don't
2016-02-18 10:12:49	gnarface	they don't track non-steamos distros very well for compatibility issues therein, is the basic issue

2016-02-18 10:46:50	gnarface	i was enabling the forced composition pipeline to try to fix some other bugs i was having related to compositing
2016-02-18 10:46:59	gnarface	it didn't work, made something else break or made it break differently
2016-02-18 10:47:02	Mneuro	what desktop environment are you using?
2016-02-18 10:47:06	gnarface	eventually i just gave up on compositing altogether
2016-02-18 10:47:35	gnarface	i'm using e17 but i've no reason to believe that any compositing setup would be materially different except perhaps in performance
2016-02-18 10:47:51	gnarface	with e17 at least it can be disabled
2016-02-18 10:48:08	Mneuro	Maybe I should run xfce without compositing and with vsync in games then

2016-02-18 11:20:09	frankyboy_	lads, what you think about gold linker aka ld.gold?
2016-02-18 11:20:25	stqn	nothing, but they say it’s good
2016-02-18 11:20:29	stqn	never used it myself
2016-02-18 11:21:07	stqn	was it for linking huge code bases that it was recommended?

2016-02-18 11:23:06	frankyboy_	there is workaround to use dynamic linker to load steam if there is issues with steam runtime
2016-02-18 11:23:22	frankyboy_	so i think is gold one will improve perfomance?
2016-02-18 11:23:38	stqn	uh
2016-02-18 11:23:43	stqn	I’m tired.
2016-02-18 11:23:50	frankyboy_	lol me too :D
2016-02-18 11:24:27	stqn	I haven’t had a good game to play in a while

2016-02-18 11:26:31	stqn	I had already read about the modem or whatever chip thing
2016-02-18 11:27:08	frankyboy_	also will be there goty edition of total war attila... what are your thoughts?
2016-02-18 11:27:19	stqn	I don’t like these games
2016-02-18 11:27:28	stqn	dunno about any goty

2016-02-18 11:28:24	stqn	so… now I just click "not interested"
2016-02-18 11:28:27	frankyboy_	what keyboard you have?
2016-02-18 11:28:30	stqn	bépo
2016-02-18 11:28:50	stqn	I mean a bépo layout. The kb is a Typematrix.
2016-02-18 11:29:41	frankyboy_	are these kyeboards slim types?
2016-02-18 11:30:00	stqn	sort of

2016-02-18 11:32:33	frankyboy_	i am afraid to play ladder, because i spent so much time in sc:bw lol
2016-02-18 11:33:16	frankyboy_	so just co-op missions to train a bit of control to be more successfull in brutal campaing :D
2016-02-18 11:33:24	stqn	I bought starcraft + broodwar a long time ago, but never got to play broodwar (which was why I bought the game)
2016-02-18 11:33:51	stqn	and running the game now is too much work…
2016-02-18 11:33:53	frankyboy_	ye, brood war is epic
2016-02-18 11:34:37	stqn	it’s not adapted for current screens, there is a patch but sigh… maybe it will work, maybe not…
2016-02-18 11:34:55	frankyboy_	according to winehq it works
2016-02-18 11:35:25	frankyboy_	but after sc2 i can't look at brood war pixels =\
2016-02-18 11:36:15	frankyboy_	stqn, i think bw will launch perfectly in wine's emulated desktop
2016-02-18 11:36:25	stqn	and I can zoom that?
2016-02-18 11:36:38	stqn	because the original 800×600 is really small
2016-02-18 11:36:55	stqn	(or was it 640×480?)
2016-02-18 11:37:22	frankyboy_	640x480... omg so low
2016-02-18 11:38:38	stqn	sc2 works in wine?
2016-02-18 11:38:59	frankyboy_	perfect
2016-02-18 11:39:08	gnarface	slow, but it works
2016-02-18 11:39:10	frankyboy_	well, there are some issues
2016-02-18 11:39:30	frankyboy_	gnarface, i switched to wine-staging, also some gallium nine patches
2016-02-18 11:39:42	frankyboy_	and everything on ultra... 30+ fps
2016-02-18 11:40:03	frankyboy_	at least in campaing ^^

2016-02-18 11:40:35	frankyboy_	also in 64-bit wine prefix
2016-02-18 11:40:42	gnarface	yea at the beginning of the rounds its fine in single player
2016-02-18 11:41:02	gnarface	where it falls apart for me is in 4 vs. 4 ranked gameplay
2016-02-18 11:41:17	gnarface	towards the end of the match when there are very high unit counts performance starts to drag badly
2016-02-18 11:41:28	frankyboy_	no wonder lol
2016-02-18 11:42:29	frankyboy_	800vs800 units xD
2016-02-18 11:42:55	gnarface	hmm. not sure i've tried it in 64-bit mode yet though
2016-02-18 11:43:02	gnarface	i think last time i couldn't get it working
2016-02-18 11:43:12	gnarface	i got the 64-bit wow client working though, so it was odd
2016-02-18 11:43:37	gnarface	maybe there wasn't a 64-bit sc2 client yet last i tried it
2016-02-18 11:43:37	frankyboy_	gnarface, are you launching games directly or via battle.net?
2016-02-18 11:43:58	gnarface	i'm sure i would have tried both
2016-02-18 11:44:19	gnarface	but by default i launch via battle.net unless something goes wrong
2016-02-18 11:44:32	gnarface	i don't have them all in the same prefix though
2016-02-18 11:45:07	frankyboy_	sandboxed prefixes?
2016-02-18 11:45:32	gnarface	i'm not sure what you mean by sandboxed in this context, but separate wine prefixes for *most* my games, yes
2016-02-18 11:47:16	frankyboy_	when prefix doesn't have access to home folders
2016-02-18 11:47:16		[11:47]
2016-02-18 11:47:40	gnarface	oh, well i've removed the default mount to / they put in winecfg under z:\ if that's what you mean
2016-02-18 11:47:50	gnarface	but games still manage to write shit to my home directory anyway :(

2016-02-18 11:48:30	frankyboy_	just to clarify what i meant
2016-02-18 11:48:32	gnarface	so it might be a wine version issue i'm having
2016-02-18 11:48:57	gnarface	i'm always hesitant to upgrade because there are frequent regressions of course
2016-02-18 11:50:51	frankyboy_	well, i am keeping games not inside prefixes now, so it is not a big problem for me now to make new prefixes

2016-02-18 12:31:04	jcastro	yeah, trusty and xenial

2016-02-18 12:34:53	stqn	gnarface: any idea if wow 64 bit runs faster than 32 bit ?
2016-02-18 12:36:22	gnarface	stqn: it seemed to, but it was difficult to quantify.  i think it helped my minimum and average framerates in large crowded areas (like the Ashran pvp zone) more than it affected the maximum framerates
2016-02-18 12:38:33	gnarface	stqn: i'd expect similar performance gains from starcraft2 in 64-bit mode but like i said earlier, was unable to test it successfully
2016-02-18 12:38:33		[12:38]

2016-02-18 12:44:55	jcastro	I'm not sure what his plans are but I can ask
2016-02-18 12:44:55	stqn	I have WoW 32 bit installed at the moment. If I finally decide to play it and it runs slow I’ll try 64 bit.
2016-02-18 12:45:10	linux_gamer	stqn, 64 bit is double as good as 32-bit
2016-02-18 12:45:17	stqn	I was surprised to see a big impact for the 64 build of Talos in phoronix’ benchmarks
2016-02-18 12:45:21	stqn	lol :)
2016-02-18 12:45:46	drumr	phoronix is a benchmark to measure against and others
2016-02-18 12:45:47	gnarface	stqn: the old world for some reason is actually very fast comparatively.  you'll only really notice material computer load in the zones added by the new er expansion s
2016-02-18 12:45:50	gnarface	*expansions
2016-02-18 12:45:57	drumr	so in some ways it has become legitimate
2016-02-18 12:46:20	stqn	gnarface: I see… I have only tried the old world recently.
2016-02-18 12:46:43	stqn	And I only have burning crusade and lych king
2016-02-18 12:46:45	drumr	tough part is translating to compare to other benchmarks for equivalenc
2016-02-18 12:47:20	gnarface	stqn: it wasn't until pandaria and draenor that the performance started to get bad (sub-30's) for me
2016-02-18 12:47:44	stqn	gnarface: what hardware do you have?
2016-02-18 12:48:31	gnarface	stqn: admittedly very old hardware, gtx 560ti and a phenom II x4 3.6GHZ but graphical settings don't change the framerate notably
2016-02-18 12:48:45	gnarface	the game seems to be cpu-bound
2016-02-18 12:48:58	gnarface	but you said before you were using the CSMT patch from staging didn't you? that's supposed to help a lot
2016-02-18 12:49:17	gnarface	in fact it probably helps more than switching to the 64-bit client
2016-02-18 12:49:38	gnarface	because the game only is currently capable of using about 30% of my cpu

2016-02-18 12:51:19	stqn	I tried with and without csmt, it ran a bit faster with csmt
2016-02-18 12:51:40	gnarface	again, where it matters most is in the new continents, in crowded areas
2016-02-18 12:51:55	gnarface	if you're alone in the wilderness the load is pretty light
2016-02-18 12:52:15	gnarface	the cpu overhead seems to grow in direct proportion to the amount of other players are on the screen
2016-02-18 12:53:07	gnarface	(if i had to guess its due to them all causing a separate network connection with its own thread, which would be utterly stupid but there you have it, congrads blizzard, Intel must love you)
2016-02-18 12:54:58	gnarface	CSMT supposedly implements some sort of very microsoft-style non-posix type of threading mechanism, as i vaguely understand it, that mitigates some of the overhead of doing stuff in this really stupid and unscaleable fashion
2016-02-18 12:54:58		[12:54]
2016-02-18 12:56:33	gnarface	maybe it detects threads that are doing the same thing at the same time and collapses them somehow so you don't have to be smart enough to optimize the game itself
2016-02-18 12:56:51	stqn	no idea
2016-02-18 12:58:15	gnarface	i used to have a bunch of free 10-day trials i could give out i think, but they stopped doing that program so they all expired
2016-02-18 12:59:11	gnarface	now the base vanilla areas are free, with item and level restrictions, but i don't think will get you anywhere where you can test the game's max load
2016-02-18 12:59:46	gnarface	its all very dependent on exactly where you're standing and how crowded it is there

2016-02-18 13:04:15	gnarface	oh hmm. yea i may have actually had to manually edit the registry to add the serial keys that identify my gpu properly, because a lot of games failed to auto-detect it right without that
2016-02-18 13:04:30	gnarface	that is definitely important for several games

2016-02-18 13:37:46	Lightkey	well, last time I corrected gnarface on the DOOM 3 source, he apparently ignored me, better late than never :p
2016-02-18 13:38:08	gnarface	Lightkey: i must have missed it, when was it?
2016-02-18 13:38:31	gnarface	i was having some issues last week
2016-02-18 13:38:52	Lightkey	logs say November
2016-02-18 13:39:06	gnarface	if it was last year, probably i just had already passed out drunk then it escaped my scrollback log, sorry
2016-02-18 13:39:21	Lightkey	no, you kept on talking :p
2016-02-18 13:39:28	gnarface	i drank more heavily than usual through november, its largely a blur
2016-02-18 13:39:59	gnarface	but the new release of the doom3 source is not the same as the dhewm3 fork, or is it?
2016-02-18 13:40:38	Lightkey	and "give them time" won't work, they got plenty of time already because it was updated last September, not released, that was four years earlier
2016-02-18 13:40:59	gnarface	no way, they didn't really release the full source 4 whole years ago??
2016-02-18 13:41:06	gnarface	i find that tough to believe
2016-02-18 13:41:09	Lightkey	at least we have The Dark Mod
2016-02-18 13:41:37	gnarface	traditionally, they'd always released the mod source separately, earlier with every version of quake, before releasing the whole engine source
2016-02-18 13:41:47	gnarface	which means you could make new mods, but not necessarily full conversions
2016-02-18 13:41:49	gnarface	or forks
2016-02-18 13:42:06	gnarface	i'd believe that 4 years ago they released the source of the mod library, but not the whole engine
2016-02-18 13:42:17	Lightkey	why is that hard to believe? that's still six years after the game came out
2016-02-18 13:42:42	Lightkey	make that seven
2016-02-18 13:42:48	drumr	doom 3?
2016-02-18 13:42:49	gnarface	well, primarily because "why hasn't anyone done anything with it yet?" is baffling to me if its really been 4 years since the whole engine was open-sourced
2016-02-18 13:42:53	drumr	that came out in 2003 or 2004
2016-02-18 13:43:25	gnarface	and also because i really expected i'd have heard of it since i heard of the first 3 on *the day* they were open sourced (both the mod source and the full engine sources)
2016-02-18 13:43:48	gnarface	so something is weird here
2016-02-18 13:43:53	gnarface	did they not GPL it this time?
2016-02-18 13:44:37	Lightkey	the only thing weird here is that you don't seem to know how to google, come on
2016-02-18 13:46:12	gnarface	hmm. it does say its GPL
2016-02-18 13:46:48	Lightkey	as I said last time, they even released the Doom 3 BFG source three years ago, one month after the game, that one was genuinely surprising as it's not just updated id Tech 4 but a cut-down id Tech 5

2016-02-18 19:39:33	anonkun	is it possible to install dotnet fx for wine/
2016-02-18 19:41:26	qptain_Nemo	yes
2016-02-18 19:41:29	qptain_Nemo	use winetricks
2016-02-18 19:41:43	anonkun	winetricks says mono is not installed, even though it is
2016-02-18 19:41:50	anonkun	and some error about 64 bit not working for other versions
2016-02-18 19:42:19	qptain_Nemo	you probably should use a 32 bit prefix yes
2016-02-18 19:42:39	qptain_Nemo	also mono should be uninstalled
2016-02-18 19:42:50	anonkun	why so?
2016-02-18 19:42:51	qptain_Nemo	because it's another implementation of the same thing
2016-02-18 19:43:00	anonkun	ah ok
2016-02-18 19:43:04	qptain_Nemo	look up instruction on winehq
2016-02-18 19:43:16	qptain_Nemo	they're quite straightforward and detailed
2016-02-18 19:43:26	anonkun	ok cool
2016-02-18 19:43:32	qptain_Nemo	just find the version of .net that you need
2016-02-18 19:45:18	qptain_Nemo	successfully installing everything up to 4.0 can be a bumpy ride though, but i've managed it, it's doable. also a clean prefix with just all version up to dotnet 4.0 installed is like 1 gb :V
2016-02-18 19:45:35	qptain_Nemo	(tbh don't remember if it was 4.0 or 4.5 though)
2016-02-18 19:45:58	qptain_Nemo	*versions
2016-02-18 19:46:02	anonkun	dang
2016-02-18 19:46:33	qptain_Nemo	i just remember i had to download one file manually and maybe restart the process one time but otherwise winetricks did everything for me
2016-02-18 19:46:48	qptain_Nemo	also make sure to set the windows version to the right value that it says in the instructions
2016-02-18 19:47:04	AciD`	are you guys experiencing a lot of crash in spec ops the line?
2016-02-18 19:47:10	AciD`	(using amd)
2016-02-18 19:47:15	qptain_Nemo	and also ideally just use a separate prefix for screwing around with .net imo
2016-02-18 19:47:28	anonkun	ok
2016-02-18 19:47:31	anonkun	I made a new prefix32
2016-02-18 19:47:39	anonkun	how do I execute stuff with the prefix32?
2016-02-18 19:48:36	qptain_Nemo	WINEPREFIX=/path/to/the/prefix wine "command"
2016-02-18 19:48:51	anonkun	game.exe?
2016-02-18 19:49:02	qptain_Nemo	yeah
2016-02-18 19:49:08	anonkun	okay
2016-02-18 19:49:08	qptain_Nemo	well the command itslef might need a path
2016-02-18 19:49:11	anonkun	thankss
2016-02-18 19:49:13	anonkun	ofc
2016-02-18 19:49:21	anonkun	unless pwd is the game folder
2016-02-18 19:49:25	qptain_Nemo	sure

2016-02-18 19:52:01	qptain_Nemo	also i used wine staging. which i heartily recommend. i think it's supposed to work in vanilla wine, but i'm not 100% sure, see if the instructions on winehq address that.

2016-02-19 01:39:33	EddDeDuck	Shield != Linux gaming
2016-02-19 01:39:41	EddDeDuck	also this is a steaming solution
2016-02-19 01:40:14	EddDeDuck	So it’s a bit like saying uising SteamLink from Windows to Linux = Linux gaming
2016-02-19 01:40:19	EddDeDuck	Meh
2016-02-19 01:41:19	@Samsai	EddDeDuck, yeah, that article was a bit of a fail
2016-02-19 01:41:35	@Samsai	annoying especially with that bait he threw
2016-02-19 01:44:10	EddDeDuck	Also I am pretty sure the streaming stuff is not powered by any native Linux solution in terms of the actual games.
2016-02-19 01:44:55	@Samsai	it's most likely a bunch of windows machines that you connect to via the geforce thing
2016-02-19 01:45:07	@Samsai	just like that one game streaming service

2016-02-19 01:46:31	@Samsai	so... the games are running on a mutated version of wine?

2016-02-19 01:48:35	EddDeDuck	I’d guess so
2016-02-19 01:48:50	EddDeDuck	Nvidia bought that compaby for their Wine based tech
2016-02-19 01:49:02	@Samsai	i suppose it would make sense
2016-02-19 01:49:12	@Samsai	provided the solution works slightly better than regular wine
2016-02-19 01:49:29	EddDeDuck	I’d assume they use that and specially compiled Windows builds with specific settings etc to come up with a streaming system runnig on a bunch of Linux based servers
2016-02-19 01:49:55	EddDeDuck	As the hardware type is 100% known it’s likely they can tune a lot more
2016-02-19 01:50:04	EddDeDuck	No need to support loads of different setups
2016-02-19 01:50:10	EddDeDuck	you tune for just one like console
2016-02-19 01:50:28	EddDeDuck	This is all me doing 2 + 2 = 4 (hopefully not 5)
2016-02-19 01:50:39	EddDeDuck	So I could be way off I’m just joining all the dots
2016-02-19 01:50:44	@Samsai	it's entirely possible that's the way they are going
2016-02-19 01:50:55	EddDeDuck	and guessing based on my knowledge of all the systems in play
2016-02-19 01:51:07	@Samsai	it would be cost effective as they can deploy basically as many linux boxes as they want for only the hardware and electricity cost
2016-02-19 01:51:28	EddDeDuck	Transgaming use to do Mac ports
2016-02-19 01:51:34	EddDeDuck	*used to
2016-02-19 01:51:36	EddDeDuck	using Cider
2016-02-19 01:51:52	EddDeDuck	So I have a fair bit of epxerience with the system back before NV bought it
2016-02-19 01:52:39	EddDeDuck	If you’re tuning for just one hardwrae setup and are streaming to a device yu remove a number of the issues Wine/Cider has
2016-02-19 01:52:39		[01:52]
2016-02-19 01:52:57	EddDeDuck	which is it isn’t as good as being high quality on multiple hardwrae and card variants
2016-02-19 01:53:05	EddDeDuck	As every setup needs a different tune
2016-02-19 01:53:09	EddDeDuck	A bit like Wine
2016-02-19 01:53:15	EddDeDuck	which it is mostly
2016-02-19 01:53:31	EddDeDuck	It is a good choice if you want to use it for somthing liek Nvidia are doing
2016-02-19 01:53:48	EddDeDuck	as your port costs are minimal as you are making a custom Windows version not a full port

2016-02-19 03:19:44	bernard__	why not
2016-02-19 03:19:58	bernard__	and what if you are looking for a horny gamer that runs linux? :D

2016-02-19 03:28:31	Ysblokje	Samsai, we should do another TF2

2016-02-19 03:30:12	Ysblokje	Did you try to get a coredump and or gdb ?
2016-02-19 03:30:27	stqn	I’ll wait a bit more before changing my steam review to negative then.
2016-02-19 03:30:54	@Samsai	it's a crash somewhere in driver, that much we already know
2016-02-19 03:31:47	@Samsai	but the bug is apparently not easily reproducible so it's likely some odd state triggered by multiple semi-random things
2016-02-19 03:31:49	Ysblokje	so a debug version and gdb ;)
2016-02-19 03:32:25	@Samsai	i haven't tried going in without reclocking, might try that next

2016-02-19 04:01:54	Gallomimia	they should try this thing called "testing" before releasing updates
2016-02-19 04:02:25	drumr	or games
2016-02-19 04:02:26	bernard__	like unit tests?
2016-02-19 04:02:28	drumr	for that matter
2016-02-19 04:02:34	Cracker	It's almost like Techland breaks Linux on purpose
2016-02-19 04:02:37	Gallomimia	yeah
2016-02-19 04:02:53	Cracker	I mean, why wouldn't they simply click launch on a Linux machine to verify it starts before releasing a patch
2016-02-19 04:03:10	Gallomimia	not enough machines?
2016-02-19 04:03:21	Cracker	it only takes 1 machine to catch most of the problems
2016-02-19 04:03:22	@Samsai	because surely a 1.6GB patch won't break anything
2016-02-19 04:03:31	Cracker	they have had
2016-02-19 04:03:47	@Samsai	i mean, why test if it's practically impossible?
2016-02-19 04:03:48	Cracker	and that can be an existing machine, with a 40 gig hard drive, with Linux installed
2016-02-19 04:04:33	@Samsai	it would be great if techland fixed their testing and porting methods
2016-02-19 04:04:47	FutureSuture	I guess it's no wonder that Dying Light has not made it to GOG considering how often it breaks.
2016-02-19 04:04:55	stqn	maybe they tested it and it worked on their machine(s)
2016-02-19 04:05:23	@Samsai	right, good old "works on my machine, ship it!"
2016-02-19 04:05:58	stqn	I mean assuming they didn’t test it *at all* is wrong.
2016-02-19 04:06:22	stqn	Update dling at 250 kB/s so I can’t test yet…

2016-02-19 04:08:13	FutureSuture	Samsai, I can't tell if you're serious or joking these days.
2016-02-19 04:08:25	FutureSuture	Okay, I assume you're serious.
2016-02-19 04:08:30	@Samsai	yes
2016-02-19 04:08:46	FutureSuture	So Trine 3 is still being worked on and what not. Cool.
2016-02-19 04:09:04	@Samsai	they pretty much said trine 3 is just a part of a longer thing
2016-02-19 04:09:14	@Samsai	because budget limits hit them pretty hard

2016-02-19 07:17:06	AciD`	abp, but without the 'allowed ad' (which I always disable)

2016-02-19 07:18:18	@Samsai	some time ago https was living aside the http version but then https was made default
2016-02-19 07:19:01	AciD`	baizon -> "As of December 2015, uBlock Origin continues to be actively developed and maintained by founder and lead developer Raymond Hill,[11] but he has withdrawn his support for uBlock, citing "serious incompatibilities in the spirit of the project".[12] The uBlock version of the software has seen little development since." from the wiki page, not very inspiring

2016-02-19 07:20:21	mETz	unless the webserver redirects to https I don't see any reason for it being wonky

2016-02-19 07:21:56	mETz	And since over https one gets a transport security header a browser will remember that and open the https version even if you open the http variant
2016-02-19 07:21:57	AciD`	oh
2016-02-19 07:22:00	@Samsai	you need to reproduce this with Piratelv
2016-02-19 07:22:10	disharmonic	ppl still use apache? :O

2016-02-19 07:23:45	AciD`	yes, let's encrypt ! :)

2016-02-19 07:24:17	AciD`	certificate problems? that is a thing of the past
2016-02-19 07:24:29	mETz	not really
2016-02-19 07:24:53	mETz	easy to misconfigure a webserver serving the wrong certificate by accident
2016-02-19 07:25:06	mETz	also expired certificates still greet me from time to time
2016-02-19 07:25:19	AciD`	and the drawbacks you are refering to, I imagine server overhead, well, there is a login option in GOL, so fuck yes, I want it to be https _only_
2016-02-19 07:25:26	AciD`	pardon my french.

2016-02-19 07:26:42	AciD`	good ! :)
2016-02-19 07:26:53	@Samsai	okay, one browser is getting the http page by default
2016-02-19 07:26:53	mETz	but not everybody uses letsencrypt
2016-02-19 07:27:13	AciD`	whatever float their boat
2016-02-19 07:27:25	@Samsai	chrome, which i basically never use, served the https page automatically and firefox likely has already gotten used to the https page
2016-02-19 07:27:27	AciD`	as long as I don't input my password in clear text.
2016-02-19 07:27:44	AciD`	because most user don't change password from a website to another
2016-02-19 07:28:04	AciD`	Samsai -> try a private tab in both, and see what it does
2016-02-19 07:28:05	mETz	that's what HSTS should at least help with
2016-02-19 07:28:22	mETz	open site over https once => browser remembers that (almost) forever
2016-02-19 07:28:27	mETz	And GOL sends that header
2016-02-19 07:29:08	mETz	I think youtube is https only by now, now I have to view those silly ads all day :/
2016-02-19 07:29:11	@Samsai	in fap fap mode firefox does get the http page
2016-02-19 07:29:26	@Samsai	i suppose there is an issue then
2016-02-19 07:30:01	AciD`	baizon -> oh so it seems ublock origin acts as abp + ghostery combined, am I right?
2016-02-19 07:30:16	mETz	nah, the only fix for that is permanently redirecting any access over http
2016-02-19 07:30:19	AciD`	ads, which ads mETz?
2016-02-19 07:30:29	AciD`	never saw one for years, thanks to ad blockers
2016-02-19 07:30:37	mETz	I do that for a few private services, like Horde

2016-02-19 07:31:49	AciD`	that issue is easily fixed by the 2 lines I pasted previously!

2016-02-19 07:42:23	AciD`	well, you missed some tests then ;)
2016-02-19 07:42:26	@NaughtySquid	i think the issue is on that specific page
2016-02-19 07:42:34	@NaughtySquid	there's probably something someone included that isn't https
2016-02-19 07:42:36	@NaughtySquid	let me check

2016-02-19 07:55:57	Piratelv	It is on purpes that there is no redirect to the https version of GOL, there are a few people who complained about not being able to view the site due to the high strength crypto settings GOL uses with ssl. However once you visit https once the HTST header should force the browser to always goto https, as pointed out by the other people
2016-02-19 07:56:00	AciD`	which version, and card ?
2016-02-19 07:56:15	AciD`	I have a radeon hd7950 with 16Gb of ram
2016-02-19 07:56:35	mirv_	a 6950, and also a kaveri
2016-02-19 07:56:41	mirv_	(kaveri = apu)
2016-02-19 07:56:48	AciD`	and fglrx 2:14.201-0ubuntu2.1
2016-02-19 07:57:33	mirv_	played it last maybe 6 months ago
2016-02-19 07:57:38	AciD`	Piratelv -> well, for non technical users, you should then change the way the login works
2016-02-19 07:57:41	mirv_	whatever fglrx was around then
2016-02-19 07:57:47	AciD`	so it's enabled only on https
2016-02-19 07:57:48	mirv_	and mesa has only improved since
2016-02-19 07:58:46	AciD`	it seems it's a case of "it-only-affects-me" problem then :(
2016-02-19 07:59:02	mirv_	try mesa
2016-02-19 07:59:46	Piratelv	That would effectively block those people who can not view the https site from commenting on GOL
2016-02-19 07:59:47	mirv_	mesa-git is best
2016-02-19 07:59:55	AciD`	hm
2016-02-19 08:00:19	AciD`	so you prefer their password to float in clear text to your server, hum, interesting
2016-02-19 08:01:39	Piratelv	But last time I heard complains about not being able to view the https site was literally multiple seasons ago (maybe even a year) so I could look into getting GOL ssl only
2016-02-19 08:01:48	AciD`	it's been a while since I compiled my own apps :)
2016-02-19 08:03:26	Piratelv	NaughtySquid, That (^) would probably require a little bit of code change to make GOL actually use the https as protocol everywhere instead of the regex replace it's using now
2016-02-19 08:03:35	AciD`	even if I don't thingk GOL as any seo problem, did you hear that google (and co) are lowering the ranks of http website
2016-02-19 08:03:43	AciD`	specially if it's the default mode
2016-02-19 08:04:20	@NaughtySquid	Piratelv: where is it doing the regex replace atm?
2016-02-19 08:04:35	Piratelv	AciD`, I know, google does prefer an https:// url to an http:// when sorting search results
2016-02-19 08:04:53	Piratelv	NaughtySquid, I'm doing that in nginx right before sending the html to the user
2016-02-19 08:05:43	Piratelv	not sure if it's still needed, it's been there since gol began using ssl
2016-02-19 08:06:29	@NaughtySquid	well, we seem to get more complaints about non-ssl than ssl
2016-02-19 08:06:29		[08:06]
2016-02-19 08:06:34	@NaughtySquid	so i guess it's time to force it?
2016-02-19 08:06:53	Piratelv	I'm fine with that
2016-02-19 08:07:05	@NaughtySquid	me too :)
2016-02-19 08:07:23	AciD`	yay ! \o/

2016-02-19 08:10:55	sziszi	AciD`, NSA used heartbleed(like bug or smtg), it was super effective

2016-02-19 10:02:58	stqn	I don’t get the appeal for VNs, they are terrible. I’d rather read a real book or watch an anime or read a manga/comic.

2016-02-19 10:47:41	hidekin	von: Higurashi is also really good and also fault milestone. I enjoy a lot of visual novels , I really like the experience
2016-02-19 10:49:26	openfbtd	bernard__, you can't buy the game without it rather
2016-02-19 10:49:26		[10:49]
2016-02-19 10:49:38	openfbtd	But yeah, it's included in the game right now
2016-02-19 10:50:30	von	hidekin, I'm not really a fan of the genrey, but I have fault and will probably find some time to play it, yeah
2016-02-19 10:51:19	bernard__	I mean, I bought the game a few months ago and didn't play it yet
2016-02-19 10:51:27	bernard__	if I play the game now, I guess I have it included
2016-02-19 10:51:34	von	I highly recommend Katawa Shoujo if you haven't played it yet, as well as Juniper's Knot.
2016-02-19 10:52:28	openfbtd	von, uploading the vide
2016-02-19 10:52:28	openfbtd	o
2016-02-19 10:52:34	openfbtd	There IS a performance hit
2016-02-19 10:52:39	openfbtd	But it's not ridiculous
2016-02-19 10:52:50	openfbtd	And I've not played with presets and the like yet
2016-02-19 10:53:03	openfbtd	Just ran SSR with default settings for h264
2016-02-19 10:54:01	hidekin	von: I played katawa shoujo but not juniper's knot. I heard from dev that they don't release the vn if they're voiced to other platforms because they need to pay the  license the voices for each platform.Tood bad :-(

2016-02-19 11:00:25	openfbtd	It runs at 50+ for me
2016-02-19 11:00:29	openfbtd	WIth 100 FOV

2016-02-19 11:01:33	stqn	thanks
2016-02-19 11:01:41	hidekin	before the following the game run better for me , i think it's worse
2016-02-19 11:02:01	stqn	I think the 164 one won’t work on linux because it relies on the new filters thing that’s not on linux
2016-02-19 11:02:13	stqn	hidekin: yeah, here too the game is now slower
2016-02-19 11:02:46	hidekin	i was on average at 70-80fps before and 40-50fps
2016-02-19 11:02:52	hidekin	now
2016-02-19 11:02:59	openfbtd	D:
2016-02-19 11:03:02	openfbtd	Interesting
2016-02-19 11:03:20	hidekin	i tried on windows , it's also worse than before
2016-02-19 11:03:22	openfbtd	Like, seriously, I played through the base game initially in a 720p window with 80 FOV
2016-02-19 11:03:29	openfbtd	And it was hovering just above 30
2016-02-19 11:03:49	stqn	that’s a huge difference :-/
2016-02-19 11:03:52	openfbtd	I've tested it on GTX680 and it was ~40 with the same settings
2016-02-19 11:03:53	hidekin	when was the last time you played the game ?
2016-02-19 11:04:03	openfbtd	And then I played the following
2016-02-19 11:04:11	openfbtd	And it's easily 50+
2016-02-19 11:04:18	openfbtd	Most of the time it's above 60
2016-02-19 11:04:22	hidekin	oh really ?
2016-02-19 11:04:33	openfbtd	I disabled film grain btw

2016-02-19 11:05:05	fs0ciety	i gave up on dying light ages ago, works.. doesn't work.. works.. i just ended up not playing it after a while
2016-02-19 11:05:26	stqn	Or maybe it was a cpu bottleneck and they improved that. For me the game is GPU-bound.
2016-02-19 11:05:44	openfbtd	For some reason while recording with nvenc, my mouse movement is jerky :(
2016-02-19 11:06:01	fs0ciety	isn't there like only dev designated to the linux build of dying light, i think i remember reading that ages ago

2016-02-19 12:32:57	openfbtd	Heh. We have seemingly low taxes

2016-02-19 12:34:16	openfbtd	You know there are pastebins, right? :)
2016-02-19 12:34:22	fs0ciety	yeah
2016-02-19 12:34:22	pdq	fs0ciety: yeah, when all is said and done (as soon as someone creates it) eventually you will be able to but, not with sli/crossfire, something specific through vulkan will allow for new configurations not dependant on sli or crossfire allowing for multi gpu :)
2016-02-19 12:34:51	fs0ciety	well i hope nvidia get off their ass and fix broken sli in the drivers then. haha
2016-02-19 12:35:44	fs0ciety	i just hope with the advent of vulkan that they would improve that element of their drivers
2016-02-19 12:36:18	pdq	they probably will but i'm sure something much better will also become the standard
2016-02-19 12:36:44	fs0ciety	i guess all in good time
2016-02-19 12:37:00	pdq	the old method depended lots on nvidia and their driver and vulkan will allow for morfe middleware and developer intnroduced things like that
2016-02-19 12:37:16	fs0ciety	i've been meaning to download the lastest git pull of retroarch as it supports vulkan
2016-02-19 12:37:43	pdq	yeah i read that retroarch blog on their site, cool
2016-02-19 12:38:03	pdq	also icculus is busy as can be doing vulkan things hehe
2016-02-19 12:38:16	fs0ciety	ahh yes forgot about mr icculus
2016-02-19 12:38:53	fs0ciety	its all in good timing since that rememdy dx12 cames out in april. microsoft are probably like "aww shit"
2016-02-19 12:39:23	fs0ciety	not to mention a dx12 title you can only buy in microsoft apps store
2016-02-19 12:39:56	pdq	yep, the thing which valve forseen over 5 years ago happening, even though who can blame ms doing wha tthey want with their own game :P
2016-02-19 12:40:10	pdq	i am loving it i have had a perma smile since last august :D
2016-02-19 12:40:19	pdq	2014
2016-02-19 12:41:05	pdq	is a sign of their business model and a good example showing the distiction between closed and open business models
2016-02-19 12:41:05		[12:41]
2016-02-19 12:41:39	fs0ciety	well lets be honest microsoft don't sell software anymore just malware. haha
2016-02-19 12:43:01	pdq	they have been easy to opt out of my life, long ago :P i never was a pc gamer though till steam for linux came
2016-02-19 12:43:46	fs0ciety	i was pc gamer in the 80s and 90s. then moved to consoles in the 00s. when games started not being platform exclusive anymore i decided to go back to PC as a gaming platform

2016-02-19 12:44:46	pdq	it can be i suppose but why not more customers as possible
2016-02-19 12:44:57	pdq	is very cool seeing what is happening now though and all the comments in all these articles of people stating how they want to ditch that os and are embracing open/free software or at the least embracing something new
2016-02-19 12:46:36	fs0ciety	well id imagine for most people moving away from windows wouldn't be because of the open-source ethos but more for the sake people don't want such an intrusive os.
2016-02-19 12:46:44	pdq	is still for early adopters of course but this is like the final piece needed
2016-02-19 12:47:03	pdq	fs0ciety: true is why i said embracing change hehe
2016-02-19 12:47:38	pdq	ideally people whould have morals and ethics and society not based on lies and debt and people who vote to be ruled over :P
2016-02-19 12:48:06	openfbtd	I see people who switch to have a “better windows” as a problem
2016-02-19 12:48:17	openfbtd	Because linux systems are not “better windows”
2016-02-19 12:48:22	openfbtd	They are different to the core
2016-02-19 12:48:28	fs0ciety	i have win10 on an alternate partition but it is only for steam and thats it
2016-02-19 12:48:52	openfbtd	People who switch just to have a free and better windows are morons and detrimental to the linux ecosystem
2016-02-19 12:49:21	fs0ciety	i went to linuxconf the other week, amazing how many people with mac books using mac os x at a linux conference
2016-02-19 12:49:32	fs0ciety	was like "ok.. sure"
2016-02-19 12:50:08	openfbtd	Don't you know
2016-02-19 12:50:15	openfbtd	Or rather haven't you noticed
2016-02-19 12:50:19	fs0ciety	what?
2016-02-19 12:50:32	openfbtd	linux has been the latest thing for tech hipsters for the last few years
2016-02-19 12:50:48	openfbtd	It's “in” these days
2016-02-19 12:51:01	openfbtd	Expect more idiotic projects to pop up
2016-02-19 12:51:17	openfbtd	It's only going to get worse till tech hipsters get bored with linux
2016-02-19 12:51:21	openfbtd	And that might take a while
2016-02-19 12:51:26	fs0ciety	haha. most tech hipsters i see just use ubuntu.. and go "i usssseeeee linux"
2016-02-19 12:51:39	openfbtd	Those are the mostly harmless ones
2016-02-19 12:51:51	openfbtd	I'm talking about Poettering and the Docker crowd
2016-02-19 12:51:58	fs0ciety	oh fuck i hate poettering

2016-02-19 12:52:15	fs0ciety	im waiting for him to make a package management system part of systemd and try to make all the distros use it
2016-02-19 12:52:24	openfbtd	The ones who tainted the perfectly nice term “DevOps” to such a degree no one I know wants to call themselves that anymore
2016-02-19 12:53:10	openfbtd	fs0ciety, I made a meta-distro to escape the madness: https://fleshless.org/pages/spark.html

2016-02-19 12:53:12	PaulDana	heh heh, heh heh...he said "taint"
2016-02-19 12:53:34	openfbtd	And just waiting for this latest thing to blow over in a corner
2016-02-19 12:54:06	openfbtd	To be fair, the experience of making an rc and a service manager taught me *a lot*
2016-02-19 12:54:18	fs0ciety	you made your own init system?
2016-02-19 12:54:22	fs0ciety	i'm looking at your page now
2016-02-19 12:54:43	openfbtd	You can say that, depending on what you actually mean. “init system” is a very ambigious term
2016-02-19 12:54:47	fs0ciety	i moved from arch to gentoo purely because of systemd. 
2016-02-19 12:54:52	openfbtd	I have an rc script and a service manager
2016-02-19 12:55:00	openfbtd	I use suckless.org's init
2016-02-19 12:55:19	fs0ciety	ahhh.. this is actually amusing.. cause i look at a bunch of suckless distros just a second ago
2016-02-19 12:55:58	openfbtd	All suckless distros are basically not useable, unfortunately
2016-02-19 12:56:14	fs0ciety	yeah i know.. i've tried a few off them
2016-02-19 12:56:14		[12:56]
2016-02-19 12:56:18	openfbtd	Partly because suckless software doesn't play well with sucky software
2016-02-19 12:56:36	fs0ciety	i try to make my desktop environment as suckless as possible
2016-02-19 12:56:47	fs0ciety	currently on my work machine its all driven with wmutils :)
2016-02-19 12:56:48	openfbtd	I'm pragmatic. My meta-distro sucks, but it sucks less than Arch :)
2016-02-19 12:57:05	openfbtd	I have a wmutils setup, but use bspwm.
2016-02-19 12:57:19	fs0ciety	there was a huge mailing list thread on putting openrc as an official choice back into arch
2016-02-19 12:57:27	openfbtd	It was fun to code, but in the end not quite what I wanted
2016-02-19 12:57:33	openfbtd	I've seen that
2016-02-19 12:57:39	openfbtd	That's actually stupid
2016-02-19 12:57:47	openfbtd	Arch is flexible
2016-02-19 12:58:01	openfbtd	You can opt put of the base group and do whatever
2016-02-19 12:58:07	openfbtd	out*
2016-02-19 12:58:15	fs0ciety	ive tried openrc with arch.. it is tempremental at the best of times
2016-02-19 12:58:35	openfbtd	I'm fine with Arch's dev team supporting one solid base
2016-02-19 12:58:42	fs0ciety	just not systemd.. lol
2016-02-19 12:59:01	openfbtd	Any solid base, even systemd. As long as they don't make my life harder
2016-02-19 12:59:03	openfbtd	And they are not
2016-02-19 12:59:12	openfbtd	...making it harder
2016-02-19 13:00:54	fs0ciety	you know, i have no issue with systemd, its the fact that the deliberate choice of making things like gnome require it is such a low move
2016-02-19 13:00:58	openfbtd	The best thing about Arch is that, by design, the dependencies in the system are pretty loose
2016-02-19 13:01:11	fs0ciety	it just goes against general unix ethos, thats my biggest complaint
2016-02-19 13:01:31	openfbtd	So, even while it's a binary distro, it allowed me to swap a very important component and not lose on anything
2016-02-19 13:01:34	openfbtd	That is impressive
2016-02-19 13:01:51	fs0ciety	arch is amazingly flexible, great distro. used it for years..

2016-02-19 13:03:45	fs0ciety	how to be the most pretentious developers successfully
2016-02-19 13:04:11	PaulDana	like i care
2016-02-19 13:04:14	openfbtd	That crown is with suckless.org

2016-02-19 13:04:35	openfbtd	Arch is a close second
2016-02-19 13:04:51	fs0ciety	is third - gentoo
2016-02-19 13:07:21	fs0ciety	openfbtd: your website amuses me :)
2016-02-19 13:07:32	openfbtd	It amuses me!
2016-02-19 13:07:46	openfbtd	That's all that matters
2016-02-19 13:07:53	fs0ciety	that is the point i guess
2016-02-19 13:08:11	openfbtd	Well, it's also sort of informational
2016-02-19 13:08:16	openfbtd	So that's good too
2016-02-19 13:08:35	fs0ciety	well i'm still reading it
2016-02-19 13:10:24	fs0ciety	currently reading about hyperboria :)
2016-02-19 13:11:00	openfbtd	Well, if it prompts people to check out what hype is, that's also very good
2016-02-19 13:11:51	fs0ciety	well you succeeded

2016-02-19 13:13:34	fs0ciety	blows dust off my pcboard floppies

2016-02-19 13:15:36	fs0ciety	had to translate your job into english :)
2016-02-19 13:15:54	openfbtd	It's in Russian because you have to know Russian to apply
2016-02-19 13:15:58	openfbtd	And live in Moscow
2016-02-19 13:17:44	fs0ciety	ahh.. i live many countries away..

2016-02-20 01:22:54	linux_gamer	EddDeDuck, it wasn't an attack on linux
2016-02-20 01:24:01	DrMcCoy	Debian Unstable as well

2016-02-20 01:29:28	Smilex	To pass data to a vulkan programmable pipeline, you need a VkPipelineLayout, with a number of VkDescriptorSet, each adhering to a VkDescriptorSetLayout. Motorhead - Overkill would be fitting right about now
2016-02-20 01:30:15	mirv_	it's not all that dissimilar to modern opengl as far as I'm aware
2016-02-20 01:30:26	mirv_	think of a descriptor set as a UBO

2016-02-20 01:32:23	Smilex	mirv_: I know that there exist simalies, and that in isolation it's all just a little much, I'm just not interested in criticising Vulkan from that lens, or maybe not at all. I'll make this cool thing, show people the thing, and that's it. My interest in Vulkan is only curiousity and how the driver situation will be for Linux and BSD
2016-02-20 01:33:34	DrMcCoy	Coming from someone with a naive fixed-function pipeline OpenGL 1.2 kind of understanding: the Vulkan examples looked like pure gibberish to me :P

2016-02-20 01:35:37	Smilex	But I know the programmable pipline for OGL
2016-02-20 01:35:39	arnej	EddDeDuck: You could checkout the mesa git repo and build it yourself. You will need to tell the app you want to run with the version where it is though. I think there are two variables for that. It takes some time to set up but after that you can easily switch between versions with git checkout && make

2016-02-20 02:19:52	stqn	and on a side note, runs almost twice faster than Dying Light, while at the same time looking better.
2016-02-20 02:20:01	Ysblokje	ouch :)
2016-02-20 02:20:08	Ysblokje	havent tried to run it again though

2016-02-20 02:59:12	@Samsai	tumocs, about the tf2 crash
2016-02-20 02:59:16	@Samsai	i have three theories
2016-02-20 02:59:52	@Samsai	1. recent update fixed it, 2. pyrovision goggles are OP and tf2 has entered p2w, 3. disabling reclocking fixes the issue
2016-02-20 03:00:39	frankyboy_	neat... galaxy for mac... aaand soon for linux :D
2016-02-20 03:00:58	@Samsai	i set my card to run on minimum clocks and played the game for 40 minutes without a crash
2016-02-20 03:00:58	mirv_	it's been soon for linux for...2 years or something now?

2016-02-20 03:03:31	frankyboy_	hmm... when mac version was released?
2016-02-20 03:04:03	mirv_	it was a few months after the first windows beta
2016-02-20 03:04:29	mirv_	since version 1.0.7.xxxx

2016-02-20 03:16:32	Smilex	it used to be annoying, but how is it now to install Windows after having installed linux? In the past longhorn replaced grub, and then you had to boot into a livecd and reinstall grub
2016-02-20 03:16:53	qptain_Nemo	Smilex: windows even casually nukes grub during updates.

2016-02-20 03:24:00	@Samsai	if your mobo has built-in hdmi port your i5 can likely act as a secondary GPU

2016-02-20 07:07:27	Yamagata	It is indeed shiny, though very beta atm ( Ran intel and nVidia demos; going to try Talos later today.)
2016-02-20 07:08:47	von	that game can haz very impressive performance drops, I'm rather curious about any chance of improving on that :)
2016-02-20 07:09:25	Yamagata	Vulkan appaears to currently be a strudy but not amazing performance boost with zero alteration to the game for what is a totally different rending paradigm.
2016-02-20 07:09:28	Yamagata	Which bodes well.
2016-02-20 07:09:29	von	openfbtd, it probably wants you to feel like a horrible person, you monster.

2016-02-20 07:10:00	disharmonic	Well there's nothing really interesting to run on Vulkan just yet. Even, Talos is currently just using a wrapper. Maybe once Valve publishes the DOTA2 port
2016-02-20 07:10:06	@Samsai	dynamic lighting seems to have been fixed in the talos beta
2016-02-20 07:10:16	@Samsai	so radeonsi doesn't have those flickering shadows anymore
2016-02-20 07:10:51	Yamagata	disharmonic, Talos is using Vulkan, whether the Vulkan procedures are being invoked through function symbols that were already in the code.
2016-02-20 07:11:28	Yamagata	It behaves very differently from OpenGL so some of the abstraction would have to remain ahead of decomposition of many engine parts.

2016-02-20 07:12:25	disharmonic	Yamagata: I didn't doubt that it's using Vulkan. It's just not providing any benefits in it's current state. See the dev blog from Croteam for more info. They will fully port the game eventually
2016-02-20 07:12:43	Yamagata	Ah yes. It is providing benefits, just not anything amazing.
2016-02-20 07:13:14	Yamagata	That is a promising thing though, in that its current situation with Vulkan is like early builds of games going from DX->OpenGL, only it's running way better than things like that usually do.
2016-02-20 07:13:55	Yamagata	That it doesn't run at 1fps is a fantastic sign.
2016-02-20 07:14:11	disharmonic	Yamagata: I would think, they wrapped the OpenGL backend, but i don't remember for sure tbh
2016-02-20 07:14:31	disharmonic	-,
2016-02-20 07:15:40	@Samsai	in any case the vulkan renderer runs faster than opengl
2016-02-20 07:15:44	Yamagata	I would imagine they probably just replaced the implementation of internal render calls; that would be the most expedient.
2016-02-20 07:16:03	@Samsai	so if you can get your hands on the vulkan enabled drivers vulkan actually provides a better talos principle experience than opengl
2016-02-20 07:16:11	Yamagata	The word "wrapper" is something I respond weirdly to at this point since what most folks seem to think it is is unmoored completely from how code works.
2016-02-20 07:16:21	stqn	someone posted on GOL that talos / vulkan is much slower than opengl
2016-02-20 07:16:41	Yamagata	It will be interesting to see how it runs on Linux, since OpenGL on Linux is usually faster than OpenGL on Windows (at least for nVidia).
2016-02-20 07:16:49	stqn	it will depend on the CPU used too
2016-02-20 07:17:13	Yamagata	stqn, wouldn't be surprised at all if it was on some systems. The majority of benchmarks being "published" as it were, seem to indicate a good boost over OpenGL.
2016-02-20 07:17:24	Yamagata	Who knows what hardware will affect atm though
2016-02-20 07:17:51	stqn	Yamagata: you have seen linux benchmarks?
2016-02-20 07:17:58	Yamagata	With more CPU involvement, even things as simple as the same clock frequency but different speeds and amount of cache or switching of various tasks could make performance wonky
2016-02-20 07:18:03	Yamagata	No, just the Windows ones.
2016-02-20 07:18:21	Yamagata	Because of the OpenGL performance difference between Windows/Linux, I'm interested to see how the Linux Vulkan version runs.
2016-02-20 07:18:22	disharmonic	What i'm hoping is that porting from DX12 -> Vulkan will be really easy.  Someone should write a tool that can convert HLSL to SPIR-V
2016-02-20 07:19:12	Yamagata	I think that already exists in some form; I know that there are already compiler backends for spitting out SPIR-V, as long as your frontend can consume the language of your choice anything->SPIR-V should be entirely possible.

2016-02-20 07:40:28	Yamagata	Actually, I need to figure out if anyone has just packaged the Vulkan beta driver for Ubuntu; I really don't want to mess with the command line installer.

2016-02-20 09:33:20	Half-Shot	Vulkan has been overhyped to shit really
2016-02-20 09:33:28	homerj	screw a new API, 50 different things in the graphics stack have "enable vsync" options
2016-02-20 09:33:34	homerj	no one knows which damn one to actually use
2016-02-20 09:33:48	Half-Shot	Haha

2016-02-20 09:35:54	homerj	the OpenGL idiots that say it's slow, because they learned OpenGL from some 20 year old tutorial on the internet, and have so many glBegin() and glEnd()'s in their code, if you searched for the it would crash grep
2016-02-20 09:36:15	homerj	and they are going to try a new API that gives these idiots LOWER level access?

2016-02-20 09:37:39	nitroflow	And that's the only reason you need
2016-02-20 09:37:58	Half-Shot	If your doing GL properly, you should be doing a lot of your work in shaders anyway imo.
2016-02-20 09:37:59	gnarface	this is fun.  for once i'm not the angriest person in the room.  i like it.
2016-02-20 09:38:17	homerj	yeah, MS, "oh you want a spinning cube in Direct3D, here download this 30G 'SDK' "
2016-02-20 09:38:38	Half-Shot	gnarface, I alternate between friendly and want to rip your throat out.
2016-02-20 09:38:45	Half-Shot	Depending on if I've spoken to Raven
2016-02-20 09:38:48	Half-Shot	And if i've eaten
2016-02-20 09:38:52	@Samsai	and on the third day of vulkan the whole API was cursed to hell and back and everyone agreed that opengl was what we needed after all
2016-02-20 09:39:13	nitroflow	So say we all
2016-02-20 09:39:27	Half-Shot	Samsai, nah OpenGL is sinking. It's already at sea level.
2016-02-20 09:39:28	homerj	and now people are talking about backing some of the compositors on vulkan
2016-02-20 09:39:34	Half-Shot	We need to convert ALL our CODE
2016-02-20 09:39:37	homerj	you know, how about you figure out how to get to Wayland first
2016-02-20 09:39:49	Half-Shot	Why does a compositor need vulkan, it does fuck all work anyway.
2016-02-20 09:40:10	homerj	and nvidia, you're a billion dollar company, you can't seriously finnish off that EGL support enough for Wayland to run?
2016-02-20 09:40:27	Half-Shot	I'm running one, my gpu is almost at idle. You don't need to accelerate the desktop with vulkan, the speed benefits are useless.
2016-02-20 09:40:50	Half-Shot	homerj, I think they need to do some kernel work as well. I don't think they have KVM yet?
2016-02-20 09:40:51	homerj	what am I talking about, nvidia can't even make steam not crash
2016-02-20 09:41:30	homerj	Half-Shot, and they can't get on the ball with that?
2016-02-20 09:41:37	homerj	I mean how many YEARS has it been?
2016-02-20 09:41:56	sziszi	guys, sorry, but i need to paste a thing, and im in need your help

2016-02-20 09:42:55	openfbtd	With max — 30
2016-02-20 09:42:58	homerj	yeah, it's called "install KDE"

2016-02-20 09:47:33	openfbtd	That infuriated me to no end until I googled it
2016-02-20 09:47:56	openfbtd	It literally can not be disabled within the WM, you have to tell firefox to stop being an annoying bitch
2016-02-20 09:48:37	sziszi	openfbtd, where do you live? I owe you a beer
2016-02-20 09:48:43	sziszi	or two

2016-02-20 09:54:24	stqn	firefox is only bringing itself to front when it knows it will annoy me
2016-02-20 09:54:45	stqn	that is to say when I clicked in a window that was partially on top of firefox
2016-02-20 09:55:02	stqn	so now firefox has its own workspace…

2016-02-20 10:02:37	openfbtd	Youtubers are finally trying to shout at Youtube collectively about their copyright strike/claim system
2016-02-20 10:02:43	openfbtd	Too bad Google gives zero shits
2016-02-20 10:02:59	openfbtd	I'm 99% certain Google won't even react in any way
2016-02-20 10:03:21	@Samsai	youtubers have been collectively complaining for ages
2016-02-20 10:03:26	@Samsai	it's no different today
2016-02-20 10:03:47	@Samsai	everyone knows the copyright systems are complete bullshit
2016-02-20 10:04:45	openfbtd	The fun part is they don't have to respond
2016-02-20 10:04:49	openfbtd	As in... why would they?
2016-02-20 10:05:25	@Samsai	any response would result in a PR disaster so they don't
2016-02-20 10:05:47	@Samsai	if they say "we aren't going to change shit" people will freak out
2016-02-20 10:06:15	@Samsai	and if they promise to change it they will be lying and the freak out will be slightly delayed
2016-02-20 10:07:32	openfbtd	Which is what I'm saying. Google won't change shit because they *don't care*
2016-02-20 10:07:59	openfbtd	It's insanely naive to think they do
2016-02-20 10:08:02	@Samsai	also copyright holders would choke them to death the second they would change it
2016-02-20 10:08:48	stqn	according to mozillazine, loadDiverted etc. "Note: Setting this preference to True will still bring the browser to the front when opening links from outside the browser."
2016-02-20 10:10:01	openfbtd	stqn, well it seems to be wrong. As it fixes the problem for me
2016-02-20 10:10:11	sziszi	stqn, same here
2016-02-20 10:10:26	stqn	ok

2016-02-20 16:52:04	Gallomimia	wow. injected popups?? what a good reason to use a VPN to do all your browsing...
2016-02-20 16:53:51	Gallomimia	depingus: there's a provider in my parts that has the same type of pricing. and their competitor that has limits posted on their ordering page but never ever enforces them
2016-02-20 16:53:52	depingus	Yep. The data caps and the warnings are new, but the injected crap is about 4 years old. They would inject warnings if virus traffic was detecting coming from your home network.
2016-02-20 16:54:06	Gallomimia	oh. i like that idea
2016-02-20 16:54:29	Gallomimia	i've toyed with the idea of cutting people off if their connection is spewing out junk like that.
2016-02-20 16:54:30	depingus	the idea is ok, but if you have 1 infected client, every one else in the house gets the injections
2016-02-20 16:55:05	Gallomimia	if you have literally no traffic on port 80 thru their line, you won't ever get injections
2016-02-20 16:55:08	depingus	they are less intrusive now with the data caps then before with the virus warning
2016-02-20 16:55:08	Gallomimia	or spied on :P
2016-02-20 16:55:20	depingus	true. no injections on https
2016-02-20 16:55:41	Gallomimia	i've actually seen an appliance made by mcaffee that claims to be able to spy on https
2016-02-20 16:56:07	depingus	i actually don't care about that. i care about the data caps. Supposedly they were always there just never enforced. But now they're getting an extra $10-$30 a month from me.
2016-02-20 16:56:12	Gallomimia	at least, i used a network that had it going on
2016-02-20 16:56:23	depingus	my pfsense router can do that
2016-02-20 16:56:42	Gallomimia	https where the S stands for suck?
2016-02-20 16:57:08	Gallomimia	sounds deadly.
2016-02-20 16:57:40	depingus	i haven't enabled it.its super buggy if you try the non-proxy way
2016-02-20 16:58:38	Gallomimia	i had a friend who experimented with a caching proxy. cool idea
2016-02-20 16:58:46	Gallomimia	but back then a 2gb cache was considered big
2016-02-20 16:59:14	Gallomimia	anyway. shower time.. cya
2016-02-20 16:59:29	depingus	peace out!

2016-02-21 01:07:19	disharmonic	Anyway that AMD promo has among others SR4, Civ:BE and Spce Run if you have a R9 class GPU
2016-02-21 01:08:04	baizon	<3 amd
2016-02-21 01:08:10	baizon	free game if you got amd hardware
2016-02-21 01:08:21	baizon	... tool which checks it is windows only
2016-02-21 01:08:52	disharmonic	Yeah. I'll try running it in Wine in a sec
2016-02-21 01:09:44	disharmonic	Err, looks like the site is a bit overloaded atm
2016-02-21 01:10:07	baizon	ofc it is, i mean is a good free game

2016-02-21 01:16:44	qptain_Nemo	do they give you steam keys so you can actually play them on linux though?

2016-02-21 01:23:02	disharmonic	Is Civ:BE even available outside of Steam?
2016-02-21 01:24:45	@Samsai	disharmonic, the nice thing is that wine will quite consistently tell its running on a GPU that is completely different to what you really have
2016-02-21 01:25:43	@Samsai	might need to jump through the registry to get it to show as an r9
2016-02-21 01:26:08	disharmonic	Samsai: Well i'm going to check anyway. I'm just waiting for Wine to install .Net 4.5

2016-02-21 01:27:22	anonkun	My case wont allow my HDMI cable to connect to my graphics card
2016-02-21 01:27:24	anonkun	lol
2016-02-21 01:27:36	disharmonic	Samsai:  They also give a game for R7 cards but the selection is more limited
2016-02-21 01:31:36	@Samsai	disharmonic, yeah, most likely some windows titles
2016-02-21 01:31:36		[01:31]
2016-02-21 01:31:43	@Samsai	not really all that interested

2016-02-21 01:35:13	disharmonic	Nope, Space Run seems to have a Linux port

2016-02-21 01:38:26	@Samsai	but messing with wine is hardly worth it so they can keep it as far as i'm concerned
2016-02-21 01:40:08	disharmonic	anonkun: you can't cut it either?
2016-02-21 01:40:36	anonkun	I think I figured it out
2016-02-21 01:40:41	anonkun	I need a mini-HDMI to a HDMI
2016-02-21 01:41:18	anonkun	Makes sense
2016-02-21 01:41:21	anonkun	Also
2016-02-21 01:41:28	anonkun	HDMI is better than VGA in what ways?
2016-02-21 01:41:45	anonkun	better latency?
2016-02-21 01:43:23	PaulDana_	well it carries sound as well as video
2016-02-21 01:43:42	 - 	PaulDana_ is now known as PaulDana
2016-02-21 01:45:34	anonkun	And thats it?
2016-02-21 01:46:03	egon2003	VGA is analog
2016-02-21 01:46:22	mETz	dvi and hdmi are a better comparison
2016-02-21 01:46:32	mETz	audio over dvi was never standardized
2016-02-21 01:46:45	anonkun	Assuming I don't use the Audio from my monitor
2016-02-21 01:46:45		[01:46]
2016-02-21 01:46:51	anonkun	Would it really make a difference?
2016-02-21 01:47:09	mETz	I'd prefer DisplayLink though, HDMI sucks bandwidth wise and HDMI 2.0 which fixes that seems to be rare
2016-02-21 01:47:35	mETz	For DVI vs. HDMI it does not matter
2016-02-21 01:47:58	stqn	anonkun: in 1080p or "1200p" there is not much difference between vga and hdmi
2016-02-21 01:48:09	stqn	(I have a 1920×1200 monitor)
2016-02-21 01:48:13	anonkun	ah
2016-02-21 01:48:16	anonkun	okay, fair enough
2016-02-21 01:48:37	stqn	but sometimes with VGA the picture may be slightly offset or blurry and you have to press the "auto" button on your monitor

2016-02-21 01:51:50	anonkun	So then, its worth the 3$ for the HDMI cable?
2016-02-21 01:52:21	disharmonic	Well, it doesn't work, as it doesn't find .NET 4.5 for some reason. It requires a Windows install
2016-02-21 01:52:51	egon2003	anonkun:  definitely, better colors and you wont have the blurryness that comes with vga
2016-02-21 01:52:55	stqn	anonkun: if you have a vga cable already, try it
2016-02-21 01:53:06	stqn	the picture quality is exactly the same :D
2016-02-21 01:53:12	stqn	for me anyway…
2016-02-21 01:53:20	egon2003	stqn: sure if you are a blind person :)
2016-02-21 01:53:27	stqn	I must be blind
2016-02-21 01:53:28	mETz	exactly
2016-02-21 01:53:30	anonkun	I do have blurriness, but its only with certain text and I think it has to do with linux fonts :P
2016-02-21 01:53:50	mETz	colors are washed out, picture is blurry in most cases
2016-02-21 01:53:58	stqn	not here
2016-02-21 01:54:03	mETz	vga died more than 10 years ago, do not try to resurrect it
2016-02-21 01:54:10	mETz	it made sense for a crt
2016-02-21 01:54:14	stqn	don't be stupid
2016-02-21 01:54:49	mETz	indeed :P
2016-02-21 01:54:58	disharmonic	VGA can't even handle the res of most new monitors

2016-02-21 06:02:34	Smilex	well it's equally likely that bugs arise more often from devs using 3rd party libraries that they don't understand everything about, and the larger the codebase, the more likely that is
2016-02-21 06:04:21	linux_gamer	and the vulkan code/command base is short?

It has existed for quite a long time, and there still doesn't seem to exist a good way to debug it, also I spent quite a bit of time writing code for every potential error, but it doesn't matter, because the thing just crashes and I get a 500 instead.

2016-02-21 10:17:57	gnarface	Smilex: PHP *can't* even cache your javascript, unless your javascript is dynamically generated by PHP anyway.
2016-02-21 10:17:59	Smilex	gnarface: I might have mixed what I was talking about. I didn't have issues with PHP and caching
2016-02-21 10:18:04	Smilex	also this was running locally
2016-02-21 10:18:12	stqn	muhahaha
2016-02-21 10:18:17	gnarface	Smilex: locally... well that rules out the ISP probably
2016-02-21 10:19:02	gnarface	Smilex: there's some well-known cache-busting headers you can set but they're different for IE and everything else, so you gotta blast both, usually you can get through *most* types of "transparent" proxies that are misbehaved but still created in good-faith that way
2016-02-21 10:19:46	gnarface	full cache-clearing in older IE versions requires first having it disabled then a manual ctrl-r refresh *twice to three times* depending on version though
2016-02-21 10:20:02	Smilex	gnarface: God. I was just writing a local javascript file. What's up with all this complexity
2016-02-21 10:20:03	gnarface	(because disabling cache in IE doesn't fully disable it)

2016-02-22 12:27:39	gnarface	presumably, its fixed now, this is all aftermath.  their servers got hacked last night and for a while the ISOs were infected
2016-02-22 12:28:05	gnarface	its a cautionary tale really about using wordpress and phpBB rather than hiring me to build you something secure from scratch

2016-02-22 12:28:40	Marezz	gnarface, heya
2016-02-22 12:29:01	gnarface	did you install Mint last night Marezz ?  if so uh... lol delete it and start over
2016-02-22 12:29:20	Marezz	gnarface, i havent
2016-02-22 12:29:22	Marezz	why?
2016-02-22 12:29:36	gnarface	their servers were hacked last night and for a while the ISOs were all infected with a botnet
2016-02-22 12:29:48	fs0ciety	i thought their servers were hacked like a week ago
2016-02-22 12:29:53	fs0ciety	or did they get hacked again
2016-02-22 12:30:13	gnarface	according to this they were hacked *twice* last night

2016-02-22 12:31:52	gnarface	oh so it happened before too
2016-02-22 12:32:03	gnarface	people really should stop relying on phpBB and wordpress
2016-02-22 12:32:04	gnarface	sigh
2016-02-22 12:34:34	*	fs0ciety gets out vim and codes html5
2016-02-22 12:34:42	Marezz	Is there a good online tactical first person shooter for gnu+linux?
2016-02-22 12:36:56	gnarface	i wish i knew, sorry Marezz

2016-02-22 12:40:11	Marezz	some time now*
2016-02-22 12:40:38	stqn	ok
2016-02-22 12:40:41	stqn	I don’t mind
2016-02-22 12:40:46	Marezz	why? dont you like tactical shooters?
2016-02-22 12:40:50	stqn	as long as I can use just "linux"
2016-02-22 12:40:53	gnarface	its proper, because just "Linux" notably also applies to Tivo and Android
2016-02-22 12:41:05	gnarface	and probably a handful of other things
2016-02-22 12:41:19	stqn	gnarface: technically maybe, but we all know what "linux" means when we say "linux"…
2016-02-22 12:41:45	gnarface	Marezz: i guess i just haven't tried them really.  they were really popular when that Rainbow Six game came out right?
2016-02-22 12:41:54	Marezz	gnarface, yeah
2016-02-22 12:41:59	stqn	Marezz: I don’t like "tactical turn-based strategy" … tactical shooters… I don’t know.
2016-02-22 12:43:56	Marezz	Shame that we dont have arma 2 & 3
2016-02-22 12:44:11	stqn	well arma 3 is available in beta I think

2016-02-22 14:43:02	gnarface	sigh
2016-02-22 14:43:13	Marezz	why the le sigh gnarface? :)
2016-02-22 14:43:13	gnarface	i want CSMT in wine but i REALLY don't want to compile it on debian again
2016-02-22 14:43:22	gnarface	its such a mess
2016-02-22 14:43:28	Marezz	whats csmt?
2016-02-22 14:43:44	gnarface	a multi-threading patch from wine staging that makes WoW run a lot better
2016-02-22 14:43:53	Marezz	ah
2016-02-22 14:44:10	Marezz	well WoW actually ran amazing for me, without any patching and meddling
2016-02-22 14:44:20	gnarface	but you were playing the free version only right?
2016-02-22 14:44:28	Marezz	i had around 150fps if i remember correctly
2016-02-22 14:44:59	gnarface	for some reason all the new pay-only expansions' areas run a lot worse than the "old world"
2016-02-22 14:45:13	Marezz	i played on a private server tho, wotlk, your mileage may vary
2016-02-22 14:45:24	gnarface	oh yea, that probably was a lot to do with it
2016-02-22 14:46:00	Marezz	hmm
2016-02-22 14:46:00		[14:46]
2016-02-22 14:46:06	gnarface	the lag gets worse in the new expansions' areas, and seems to be worst around big crowds
2016-02-22 14:46:11	Marezz	gnarface, what are your 3 most favorite games?
2016-02-22 14:46:54	gnarface	that's a really tough one
2016-02-22 14:47:06	Marezz	hah :)
2016-02-22 14:48:24	gnarface	well the thing is, you can't judge it necessarily by play time
2016-02-22 14:48:39	gnarface	judging by play time it'd have to be WoW but honestly that hasn't been true for a while that its my favorite game
2016-02-22 14:48:43	gnarface	now that's more an addition
2016-02-22 14:48:59	gnarface	if i had to say, i'd probably my *favorite* 3 games are on Nintendo right now
2016-02-22 14:49:10	Marezz	shoot
2016-02-22 14:49:50	Marezz	which ones? i nearly bought a wii u ~3 years ago
2016-02-22 14:49:57	gnarface	Yoshi's Wolly World, Xenoblade Chronicles X, and maybe ither Splatoon or Chronicles of Mystara
2016-02-22 14:50:55	Marezz	man, xenoblade looks so damn awesome
2016-02-22 14:51:06	gnarface	its fucking great to be honest
2016-02-22 14:51:10	gnarface	might be my top favorite
2016-02-22 14:51:25	gnarface	but my GF likes the Yoshi's Wooly World the most
2016-02-22 14:51:28	gnarface	so that's the one i play with her most often lately
2016-02-22 14:52:00	Marezz	regretfully i missed all the good consoles
2016-02-22 14:52:15	Marezz	i only had sega mega drive 2(?)
2016-02-22 14:52:37	gnarface	yea but SNES games run great in emulators these days :)

2016-02-22 14:54:28	gnarface	now, on *Steam* my favorite game is probably Portal or Portal2, maybe Civ5 and Ziggurat being close seconds
2016-02-22 14:55:02	gnarface	it'd be easier to break it down perhaps into categories like "favorite game i haven't beat yet"
2016-02-22 14:55:12	gnarface	and "favorite game i'd encourage anyone to play all the way through"
2016-02-22 14:55:32	Marezz	gimme few of the latter onezs
2016-02-22 14:55:34	Marezz	ones*
2016-02-22 14:56:08	gnarface	non-specific to steam/nintendo?  portal1&2, every Zelda game from Windwaker onward
2016-02-22 14:56:45	Marezz	pc only, i have no console
2016-02-22 14:56:53	gnarface	well, emulators though
2016-02-22 14:57:00	gnarface	hmm. lemme think more
2016-02-22 14:58:44	gnarface	Marezz: gimme a minute to get back to you, my GF is demanding my attention
2016-02-22 14:58:53	Marezz	hehe sure thing
2016-02-22 14:59:01	Gallomimia	loved portal. don't think i quite finished portal 2 tho
2016-02-22 14:59:11	Gallomimia	most important part of those games is the sound

2016-02-22 15:04:54		[15:04]
2016-02-22 15:05:21	stqn	mirror's edge is great too.
2016-02-22 15:05:50	gnarface	Marezz: lol my GF recommends Rollercoaster Tycoon in absolute seriousness
2016-02-22 15:06:05	gnarface	Marezz: (the original, not the sequels)
2016-02-22 15:06:09	Marezz	gnarface, i hate those kind of games
2016-02-22 15:06:33	Marezz	whenever my friend mentiones citiy skylines i cry every tiem
2016-02-22 15:06:34	Marezz	xD
2016-02-22 15:06:49	gnarface	lol
2016-02-22 15:07:04	gnarface	well in all seriousness, Portal 1 & 2 are definitely top of the list.  those are must-play
2016-02-22 15:07:16	gnarface	Portal2 is worth beating just to unlock the co-op mode (new content that you can't play alone)
2016-02-22 15:07:29	gnarface	you like real-time Strategy, Marezz ?
2016-02-22 15:07:34	Marezz	gnarface,  yeah
2016-02-22 15:07:38	gnarface	like starcraft etc?
2016-02-22 15:08:01	Marezz	well i dont dislike it but i didnt really get hooked

2016-02-22 15:08:07	gnarface	there is the one game called Kohan: Immortal Soverigns that was REALLY good.  a compelling type of RTS that's squad based
2016-02-22 15:08:14	gnarface	and they made a linux version
2016-02-22 15:08:24	Marezz	i loved c&c generals
2016-02-22 15:08:35	Marezz	CoH
2016-02-22 15:08:53	Marezz	played a lot of lotr middle earth back in the dayt
2016-02-22 15:09:04	gnarface	i played Kohan and beat it and my only complaint was was that it wasn't long enough. i wanted there to be more single-player missions.  i could never get anyone to play it multiplayer with me, but it had multiplayer too
2016-02-22 15:09:11	Marezz	i always wanted to get into total war series
2016-02-22 15:09:20	gnarface	hmm. i hear that one is good
2016-02-22 15:09:23	gnarface	never played it either
2016-02-22 15:09:55	Marezz	oh also
2016-02-22 15:10:19	Marezz	age of mythology
2016-02-22 15:10:22	Marezz	loved that game
2016-02-22 15:10:37	gnarface	sounds familiar...
2016-02-22 15:11:21	gnarface	Marezz: check out Kohan
2016-02-22 15:11:44	gnarface	Marezz: i liked it becuase there was troop formations.  it wasn't like starcraft where everyone just runs into battle in a disorganized mob
2016-02-22 15:12:02	gnarface	Marezz: you could actually make a line, and make the troops hold the line
2016-02-22 15:12:40	gnarface	Marezz: or make them go into formations that were more defensive vs offensive, and set them up in little platoon/legion style groups with carefully selected mixes of heroic troops and ranged/melee scrub units
2016-02-22 15:12:50	Marezz	i love that as well
2016-02-22 15:12:55	Marezz	making op troop combos
2016-02-22 15:13:25	gnarface	its a pretty old game by now, it should run very well on any hardware
2016-02-22 15:13:25	Marezz	omg, also rise of nations
2016-02-22 15:13:32	Marezz	man i really loved those old games..
2016-02-22 15:13:34	gnarface	hmm. rise of nations sounds familiar too
2016-02-22 15:13:37	Marezz	bringing back memories
2016-02-22 15:14:12	gnarface	I'd recommend any Final Fantasy game if you like RPGs for the story line, but most especially #'s 4, 7, 9 and 10
2016-02-22 15:14:24	Marezz	i think that was my one of the most favorite games for me back then and most favorite rts
2016-02-22 15:14:33	gnarface	but one thing they have in common is the combat can get very repetetive and "grindy" which is a downside of any Final Fantasy game
2016-02-22 15:14:55	Marezz	lol final fantasy is so confusing for me, i could never understand it, what is it about and all. granted, i havent played their games
2016-02-22 15:15:07	gnarface	i know there were PC releases of 7 and 9, and the others should run in linux on recent emulators
2016-02-22 15:15:27	gnarface	oh wait, my bad, i meant final fantasy 8 when i said 9
2016-02-22 15:15:29	gnarface	i never played 9
2016-02-22 15:15:38	stqn	yeah FF is really strange… well not the first one, the first one is ok
2016-02-22 15:15:47	Marezz	btw, would you mind telling me something more about emulators? you can pm if its not allowed here
2016-02-22 15:15:50	stqn	for an indie game
2016-02-22 15:15:52	gnarface	the PC releases of 7 and 8 should run in Wine.  i think that you can get 10 to run in the psx emulator
2016-02-22 15:16:04	gnarface	(the PS2 version of FF10 that is)
2016-02-22 15:16:52	gnarface	Marezz: i don't think the emulators are illegal.  the illegal part is stealing roms instead of buying the game yourself, but its none of my business where you get your game roms.  for all i know your country doesn't enforce US/JP copyright law anyway.  *shrug*
2016-02-22 15:17:14	fs0ciety	ff10 in pcsx2 runs fine
2016-02-22 15:17:18	fs0ciety	even ff12 runs fine
2016-02-22 15:17:33	gnarface	Marezz: but you know, fair use even in the US grants you the right to use an emulator to play ripped roms of games you actually own
2016-02-22 15:17:45	fs0ciety	i use the pcsx2 emulator to play my xenosaga series of games
2016-02-22 15:18:33	Marezz	one game that stayed in my memory from ps, i played it briefly. legacy of kain
2016-02-22 15:18:35	gnarface	i heard the later playstation and nintendo gamecube emulator (pcsx2 and dolphin i think they're called) even can play games in higher res than the original console could, with out needing special data
2016-02-22 15:18:48	Marezz	i just want to get all of the parts one day and play it one by one
2016-02-22 15:19:04	fs0ciety	legacy of kain
2016-02-22 15:19:07	fs0ciety	thats a blast from the past
2016-02-22 15:19:33	Marezz	really a great game
2016-02-22 15:19:36	gnarface	Marezz: there's a few emulators that are in the debian repo too
2016-02-22 15:19:45	Marezz	also i hate ms for their halo bullshit
2016-02-22 15:20:31	gnarface	how you feel about puzzle games like the point&click adventure games like Myst and Monkey Island series, Marezz ?
2016-02-22 15:20:31		[15:20]
2016-02-22 15:20:33	Marezz	they hook you up with first 2 games then they want to make you buy their console, thanks but no thanks
2016-02-22 15:21:04	gnarface	or old Lucas Arts games that run in Scummvm like Full Throttle
2016-02-22 15:21:26	gnarface	man, Full Throttle... yea i'd definitely put that on the list of "must play games of all time" if you don't hate point&click adventures
2016-02-22 15:22:04	gnarface	you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel righteous anger, and you'll hate minivans for the rest of your life
2016-02-22 15:22:16	Marezz	gnarface, well i dont think i ever played those kind of games (click puzzles) but myst seems ok-ish
2016-02-22 15:22:54	Marezz	they dont seem like my cup of tea
2016-02-22 15:23:00	gnarface	Marezz: they can get tedious if you get stuck in a corner, but these days those games all have full walkthroughs googleable, so if you get really stuck its not like you can't just cheat by looking up the answer to the puzzle so you can get past it and beat the game to see the end
2016-02-22 15:23:17	gnarface	with those games, its as much about story as gameplay
2016-02-22 15:23:26	gnarface	but some people don't like "pixel hunting"
2016-02-22 15:23:37	gnarface	i felt like Full Throttle was worth it though
2016-02-22 15:23:59	gnarface	Myst may not have aged so well with time, since its so old, i haven't played it in a long while.  i re-played Full Throttle repeatedly though
2016-02-22 15:24:22	gnarface	part of Myst's attraction early on was the graphics were so visually stunning but i'm sure they'll look pretty dated by now
2016-02-22 15:24:39	gnarface	whereas Full Throttle... the graphics don't matter so much, its kinda comic-book cartoon style.  its more about the story and the soundtrack
2016-02-22 15:24:47	gnarface	oh man the soundtrack... i bought the soundtrack to that game
2016-02-22 15:24:53	gnarface	haha
2016-02-22 15:24:56	gnarface	good stuff
2016-02-22 15:25:34	gnarface	more recently on steam in linux: Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP
2016-02-22 15:25:36	gnarface	that game was GREAT
2016-02-22 15:25:37	gnarface	but short
2016-02-22 15:25:55	gnarface	and i would say if you're zelda fan, also especially haunting but only tangentially reminiscent
2016-02-22 15:26:07	gnarface	but i would say only worth it if you find it on a steep discount, because its so damn short
2016-02-22 15:26:35	gnarface	i payed 14$ for it when it was one of the first few linux games on steam and i wanted to be charitable, but man... its honestly not worth more than $2.50
2016-02-22 15:26:48	gnarface	the soundtrack is really great for a video game though
2016-02-22 15:26:54	gnarface	so if you get it, make sure to get the deluxe version
2016-02-22 15:27:03	gnarface	but don't pay more than about $5 max
2016-02-22 15:27:34	gnarface	Marezz: how do you feel about platformers?  like mario/metroid/castlevania type games?
2016-02-22 15:28:28	gnarface	Marezz: i got Shovel Knight on my Nintendo but its on Steam now too and i'd 100% recommend it to anyone who likes the "metroid-vania" genre of 16-bit graphics style platformers
2016-02-22 15:28:33	gnarface	story is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:35	gnarface	music is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:37	gnarface	gameplay is epic
2016-02-22 15:28:40	gnarface	they knocked it out of the park
2016-02-22 15:28:45	gnarface	but its not an easy game
2016-02-22 15:28:56	gnarface	not by any stretch of the imagination
2016-02-22 15:29:41	Marezz	well i liked super mario back then when i had sega
2016-02-22 15:29:46	gnarface	Marezz: unfortunately, there's a large blind spot with regards to "tactical shooters" for me.  i can't help you much there
2016-02-22 15:29:48	Marezz	i havent played those other games
2016-02-22 15:30:06	gnarface	if you liked super mario you'd likely enjoy Shovel Knight
2016-02-22 15:30:26	gnarface	its like mario but you get an attack other than "jump on stuff"

2016-02-22 16:07:59	gnarface	fs0ciety: i never played tales of phantasia, but i played tales of symphonia on the Wii which i've heard was very much a similar style of game and i'd absolutely add it to the must-play list, now that i think of it
2016-02-22 16:08:16	gnarface	fs0ciety: sorry, scratch that, i typed Wii but my head said GameCube
2016-02-22 16:08:44	fs0ciety	well its the first in the tales series
2016-02-22 16:08:46	fs0ciety	its on snes
2016-02-22 16:08:58	gnarface	fs0ciety: also, to a lesser degree gamewise in single-player quality but in a very similar thread for multiplayer quality, phantasy star online 1&2 (also on the gamecube)
2016-02-22 16:09:20	gnarface	pso3 they turned it into a card game, f that
2016-02-22 16:09:25	fs0ciety	i remember playing pso on the dreamcast :)
2016-02-22 16:09:26	gnarface	i'm not all about that
2016-02-22 16:09:26	fs0ciety	memories
2016-02-22 16:09:36	gnarface	oh yea, it was on the dreamcast first when i played it! i'd forgotten
2016-02-22 16:09:46	gnarface	then they made a re-release for gamecube that was 1&2 on one disk
2016-02-22 16:09:50	fs0ciety	i really do love that console
2016-02-22 16:10:00	fs0ciety	i'm itching for shenmue 3
2016-02-22 16:10:02	gnarface	it was a great console, i should have bought one
2016-02-22 16:13:16	gnarface	they still making those?
2016-02-22 16:13:16		[16:13]
2016-02-22 16:13:32	gnarface	that was an epic immersive RPG experience i'd loved to have actually experienced too
2016-02-22 16:13:49	gnarface	for the longest while it was on my todo list but eventually i gave up when i gave up on ever owning a dreamcast
2016-02-22 16:14:24	gnarface	years after they were discontinued, thinkgeek supposedly found a lost palette of unsold dreamcasts in mint condition
2016-02-22 16:14:28	homerj	I played Shenmue 3
2016-02-22 16:14:30	gnarface	they liquidated them at 90$ each
2016-02-22 16:14:38	homerj	called Warehouse Worker Simulator 2016
2016-02-22 16:14:40	gnarface	not buying one is my biggest regret of my life
2016-02-22 16:14:48	gnarface	not buying TWO is my second biggest regret of my life
2016-02-22 16:16:02	gnarface	(don't get me wrong, i've got PLENTY of regrets, but its important to keep perspective)
2016-02-22 16:21:39	gnarface	(and in case you were wondering, i'd have kept one to play games and the second one to install BSD on

2016-02-23 01:46:21	gkeen_	haha upgraded :D
2016-02-23 01:46:23	qptain_Nemo	Smilex: considering they have allegedly elevated the upgrade to w10 to being a necessary update, it might be impossible now
2016-02-23 01:46:43	Raven67854	Not impossible you just have to avoid about 12 or so specific updates and keep the auto updater off
2016-02-23 01:47:00	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: so you can still unselect it?
2016-02-23 01:47:03	Raven67854	Yes
2016-02-23 01:47:08	qptain_Nemo	i see
2016-02-23 01:47:11	Raven67854	It still downloads though automagically though
2016-02-23 01:47:18	Raven67854	takes up like what 4-8gb of HD space
2016-02-23 01:47:24	qptain_Nemo	:D
2016-02-23 01:47:40	gkeen_	one would assume there is like a way to writeprotect the directory it downloads the w10 update to
2016-02-23 01:47:40	Smilex	I think I can't get direct x because my Win 7 is too old, so I want a  few updates.

2016-02-23 01:48:15	Smilex	Or maybe I'll just get Win 10. I mostly just need windows for builds

2016-02-23 02:00:17	qptain_Nemo	does it enable you to play dx11+ games for instance?
2016-02-23 02:00:17	Raven67854	When it works it works as expected

2016-02-23 02:01:20	Raven67854	Don't know
2016-02-23 02:01:21	gkeen_	thats what i see people use when i check youtube
2016-02-23 02:01:25	Raven67854	Also don't honestly care :P
2016-02-23 02:01:41	gkeen_	well could be fun to try out :P
2016-02-23 02:01:51	Raven67854	Nothing involving windows is fun
2016-02-23 02:02:17	qptain_Nemo	well
2016-02-23 02:02:27	qptain_Nemo	i genuinely like using wine sometimes
2016-02-23 02:02:27	gkeen_	good point
2016-02-23 02:02:39	qptain_Nemo	but generally yeah i agree
2016-02-23 02:02:40	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Go for it nobody is stopping you
2016-02-23 02:02:40	Raven67854	Also

2016-02-23 02:03:44	Raven67854	Yep
2016-02-23 02:03:51	Smilex	Now I can play a functional solitaire
2016-02-23 02:03:56	Raven67854	Nobody cares
2016-02-23 02:04:18	gkeen_	Smilex: i had solitare running in wine in the 90s ;)
2016-02-23 02:04:34	Raven67854	Linux solitare has more cards
2016-02-23 02:04:40	Raven67854	Also looks the same as it always has
2016-02-23 02:04:42	Raven67854	Never changed
2016-02-23 02:04:53	Smilex	gkeen_: It's great for watching progress timers
2016-02-23 02:05:22	Smilex	Raven67854: The solitaire I got, which I think is GNOME, is broken, which was why I mentioned it
2016-02-23 02:05:31	Raven67854	Smilex, Stop using broken gnome stuff
2016-02-23 02:05:32	Raven67854	Also
2016-02-23 02:05:40	Raven67854	The Windows 10 solitare cracks me up
2016-02-23 02:05:48	Smilex	if you cycle the stack too many times, it goes away
2016-02-23 02:05:49	Raven67854	Video ads or $9.99/y or $1.99/m
2016-02-23 02:06:04	Smilex	Video ads!? No fucking way.

2016-02-23 02:06:38	Smilex	I laughed at seeing solitaire on Win8 have a premium thing.
2016-02-23 02:06:50	Raven67854	win8 has two solitares
2016-02-23 02:06:54	Raven67854	The old one which works fine

2016-02-23 02:07:11	Raven67854	Because fuck you that's why
2016-02-23 02:07:23	Smilex	I couldn't find the old one then. I used the search function, but it gave me Bing results
2016-02-23 02:07:39	Raven67854	win8 doesn't have bing search results
2016-02-23 02:07:56	Raven67854	Pretty sure you were using windows 10
2016-02-23 02:08:01	Smilex	My sister's Win8 laptop does
2016-02-23 02:08:15	Raven67854	Then she added that
2016-02-23 02:08:22	Raven67854	Because by default win8 doesn't have bing search results
2016-02-23 02:08:34	Smilex	unless they upgraded to Win10 without me knowing, which could have happened because of Windows Update. There's no way they'd do it themselves
2016-02-23 02:08:50	Raven67854	Well you see it happen
2016-02-23 02:08:53	Raven67854	Also you'd know
2016-02-23 02:08:58	Raven67854	Win10 looks different from win8
2016-02-23 02:09:28	Smilex	it doesn't have the Metro UI thing?
2016-02-23 02:09:31	Raven67854	No
2016-02-23 02:09:36	Raven67854	Also its modern ui not metro ui
2016-02-23 02:09:47	Smilex	oh then it was Win8
2016-02-23 02:09:55	Raven67854	Most people never used the modern ui anyway
2016-02-23 02:09:55		[02:09]
2016-02-23 02:10:00	Raven67854	So it'd just be a desktop
2016-02-23 02:10:07	Smilex	what's metro ui then? I remember Windows trying to get me to develop for it at some point
2016-02-23 02:10:20	gkeen_	Smilex: its the same thing
2016-02-23 02:10:23	Raven67854	Its original name before they changed it
2016-02-23 02:10:23	gkeen_	they renamed it
2016-02-23 02:10:31	Raven67854	They renamed it BEFORE the launch of win8
2016-02-23 02:10:34	Smilex	I used the search function in the modern ui, and it showed bing results
2016-02-23 02:10:45	Raven67854	Then your sister added bing search results
2016-02-23 02:10:45	Smilex	I think it does that when it doesn't find anything local
2016-02-23 02:10:48	Raven67854	Tell her good job
2016-02-23 02:10:55	Raven67854	No it doesn't
2016-02-23 02:11:00	Raven67854	It doesn't have that by default
2016-02-23 02:11:15	qptain_Nemo	tell her to use linux
2016-02-23 02:11:20	qptain_Nemo	:V
2016-02-23 02:11:26	Smilex	I guess she added it then
2016-02-23 02:11:26	Raven67854	What qptain_Nemo said
2016-02-23 02:11:43	Raven67854	I'm with qptain_Nemo on this
2016-02-23 02:12:12	Smilex	qptain_Nemo: I did change my mother's laptop to Linux
2016-02-23 02:12:43	Smilex	so they do use it
2016-02-23 02:13:09	Raven67854	Shame
2016-02-23 02:13:53	hidekin	my mother is also using linux now since I installed it on her new laptop xD
2016-02-23 02:14:04	hidekin	she even prefer ubuntu to windows
2016-02-23 02:14:12	Raven67854	hidekin, Not a shock really
2016-02-23 02:14:31	Raven67854	people that just browse the web, write emails. Will surprise by how much they prefer linux which stays out of there way
2016-02-23 02:15:10	Future_Suture	hidekin, same. I feel a lot safer with my parents on Linux. Less crapware e.g. toolbars that install themselves and the like.
2016-02-23 02:15:13	hidekin	It's also easier for non technical people to use the side label with the shortcuts
2016-02-23 02:15:24	hidekin	*side panel
2016-02-23 02:15:49	Smilex	one problem was that I didn't commit to it, and decide to install Zorin. Bad idea. It just got worse and worse over time. Now it has lubuntu, which is much better

2016-02-23 02:17:30	Future_Suture	Also, Raven67854, that whole security issue you kept mentioning regarding Linux Mint, was the recent fiasco part of your complaint initially?
2016-02-23 02:17:59	EddDeDuck	If I have to give a machine for internet emails etc then it’s OS X or Linux never Windows.
2016-02-23 02:18:12	qptain_Nemo	heh i was actually considering asking Raven67854 if he gloated about it just a few moments ago
2016-02-23 02:18:29	Raven67854	Future_Suture, what do you mean initially?
2016-02-23 02:18:36	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, I didn't say a word because its mint.
2016-02-23 02:18:39	Raven67854	Mint hates security
2016-02-23 02:18:41	Raven67854	Look at what happens
2016-02-23 02:18:49	qptain_Nemo	well
2016-02-23 02:18:51	qptain_Nemo	on one hand yes
2016-02-23 02:18:57	qptain_Nemo	on another hand the exploit was through wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:07	qptain_Nemo	putting security and php in one sentence is a joke to begin with
2016-02-23 02:19:16	qptain_Nemo	it's not like you can succeed at it
2016-02-23 02:19:17	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Again we go back to Mint hates security. Because only someone who hates security would use wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:18	qptain_Nemo	:V
2016-02-23 02:19:28	qptain_Nemo	hah, a fair point
2016-02-23 02:19:45	Raven67854	You can make php secure to be fair. But not if you use wordpress
2016-02-23 02:19:53	qptain_Nemo	can you though?
2016-02-23 02:19:55	Raven67854	Yes
2016-02-23 02:20:05	Raven67854	Afterwards you'll be bold and probably have commited a few murders
2016-02-23 02:20:07	Raven67854	But yes you can
2016-02-23 02:20:20	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: "register globals" is no longer the default configuration.  it was *never* recommended
2016-02-23 02:20:21	Future_Suture	Raven67854, I remember you taking issue with the distro itself, but the recent fiasco seems to be all about the website

2016-02-23 02:20:40	Raven67854	Future_Suture, So ? I haven't said anything about the recent fiasco
2016-02-23 02:21:04	Raven67854	The recent issues with mint have nothing to do with my stance on mint
2016-02-23 02:21:08	Raven67854	It's just something that happened
2016-02-23 02:21:16	Future_Suture	I am asking if your issues were with the distro itself or the distro/team/website/whatever in general, that's all
2016-02-23 02:21:20	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: if you say so.i have hard time imagining it happening in any meaningful and long term sense though :V
2016-02-23 02:21:44	Raven67854	Future_Suture, The distro/dev team
2016-02-23 02:21:49	Raven67854	None of which has much to do with the recent issue
2016-02-23 02:21:56	Raven67854	So again I don't really get why you're even asking this
2016-02-23 02:22:16	qptain_Nemo	i respect their ability to make easy to use things but it's a shame they appear to be lacking in other areas...
2016-02-23 02:22:22	Future_Suture	Judging from comments, the team, specifically Clem, are very much at fault regarding the recent issues, hence my curiosity
2016-02-23 02:22:32	Raven67854	They forsake security for all else
2016-02-23 02:22:36	Raven67854	This is what happens
2016-02-23 02:23:07	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, But its not any easier to use than Ubuntu. And quite frankly Ubuntu has never had these issues :p. I just put Ubuntu on any new users machine. Fuck mint
2016-02-23 02:23:27	Raven67854	I give them a choice between Ubuntu 14.04/Latest or ElementaryOS
2016-02-23 02:23:32	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: fair enough, i just had virtually 0 experience with ubuntu

2016-02-23 03:52:12	PaulDana	in a film, even if someone else wrote the screen play, sometimes the film reflects the personality of the director as much as or more than it reflects the story being told. it is as if the director is the "author" (french autuer) of the film
2016-02-23 03:52:37	PaulDana	to use it in the context of a game seems sort of pretentious

2016-02-23 10:23:53	qptain_Nemo	wait a second you're getting more than 60 fps with vsync on? how is that possible?
2016-02-23 10:24:14	qptain_Nemo	or do the extra frames just get discarded visually
2016-02-23 10:24:33	stqn	vsync is off ingame of course
2016-02-23 10:24:50	qptain_Nemo	oh so the game thinks it's showing more than 60
2016-02-23 10:24:57	stqn	yes
2016-02-23 10:24:59	qptain_Nemo	right

2016-02-23 10:27:33	stqn	I did a quick test with Dying Light and the difference is slightly bigger, but it’s not a benchmark so characters are moving differently…
2016-02-23 10:28:03	stqn	anyway it’s a bit better with ForceCompositionPipeline than with Compton

2016-02-24 07:24:01	AciD`	I lived for many, many years hard reseting my linux box when something went wrong, and corrupting my ext2 fs..
2016-02-24 07:24:06	AciD`	then I discovered that

2016-02-24 07:26:45	AciD`	but I had to do it few days ago, because of a shitty written game : spec ops the line
2016-02-24 07:27:20	Piratelv	I wonder if that also works with a kernel level hard lock (vmware locks my pc ever 2 out of3 times I use it :/ )
2016-02-24 07:27:30	AciD`	(which keeps crashing, and not letting go of the controls)
2016-02-24 07:27:59	AciD`	Piratelv -> not enough free ram and a swappiness set to 0 perhaps?
2016-02-24 07:28:31	qptain_Nemo	AciD`: i can usually switch to a tty from programs that grab all input
2016-02-24 07:29:56	Piratelv	AciD`, Doubt full it's an ram issue (got 16gb ram with another 12g swap) I'm thinking too little cpu left for software raid to keep up with the i/o or pulseaudio
2016-02-24 07:30:54	AciD`	weird
2016-02-24 07:31:49	AciD`	I too have 16GB ram, but I manage to use it entirely some times, and with 0 swap ; welcome to kernel-hell-that-does-not-OOM-like-it's-supposed-to
2016-02-24 07:31:50	AciD`	:|

2016-02-24 07:41:07	Piratelv	They were disabled for a short while, but re-enabled since ubuntu 12.04. Starting 12.10 it's enabled but limited to but a few commands (sync,remount,reboot)

2016-02-24 08:39:10	drumr7	samsai there is a fix for that
2016-02-24 08:39:16	drumr7	i had similar issue
2016-02-24 08:39:45	drumr7	obs has a room on quakenet too and i believe the founder and some devs are on there
2016-02-24 08:39:55	@Samsai	drumr7, nah, there isn't a fix until OBS gets patched i'm afraid
2016-02-24 08:40:05	drumr7	i forget what fixed mine but i also had reported a bug i think they fixed too
2016-02-24 08:40:23	@Samsai	or mesa starts accepting behavior considered to be against the spec
2016-02-24 08:40:41	drumr7	or just not use mesa

2016-02-24 08:41:24	@Samsai	yeah, that kind of defeats the point
2016-02-24 08:41:45	drumr7	of course
2016-02-24 08:42:09	@Samsai	might as well throw the card out the window at that point and switch back
2016-02-24 08:44:34	drumr7	i used it with amd
2016-02-24 08:44:38	drumr7	obs that is
2016-02-24 08:46:27	drumr7	did you try their irc channel on quakenet?
2016-02-24 08:46:48	@Samsai	nope, but i did expect them to read their mantis

2016-02-24 13:24:09	calexil	Code needs to read a sensor input and send that information through a LoRaWAN to a cluster of lorawan hubs, the signal needs to include code detailing the location of the sensor ie:(geolocation).

2016-02-24 18:47:28	gnarface	Samsai: that's ... bad
2016-02-24 18:47:44	gnarface	Samsai: we're talking from comments right?
2016-02-24 18:47:53	@Samsai	nope, an article

2016-02-24 18:48:44	@Samsai	i think they were hoping that their article is automatically published
2016-02-24 18:48:47	gnarface	Samsai: but if any random jackass can put executable javascript onto the site that other people can see... that's pretty much the definition of a XSS attack
2016-02-24 18:48:53	@Samsai	but all articles from non-editors are screened

2016-02-24 18:49:09	gnarface	Samsai: does it show submitted articles?
2016-02-24 18:49:29	@Samsai	the search function only shows article titles and links to the articles
2016-02-24 18:49:40	@Samsai	not even the tagline is shown in the search
2016-02-24 18:49:41	gnarface	Samsai: probably best to make sure that someone can't be sent a link to a search url that shows unapproved articles.   should be easy to fix if so
2016-02-24 18:50:03	gnarface	Samsai: some idiot could actually click on one of those unapproved articles in theory....
2016-02-24 18:50:40	@Samsai	none of the articles in the submission queue should be visible anywhere in the website unless you are an editor
2016-02-24 18:50:50	@Samsai	the search function should ignore it entirely
2016-02-24 18:50:59	gnarface	oh, so its only a vulnerability to editors
2016-02-24 18:51:26	@Samsai	and even them only if they decide to preview the article instead of going to the editor

2016-02-24 18:52:05	@Samsai	because the script shows up really nicely in the editor and would likely make people quite suspicious
2016-02-24 18:53:08	gnarface	i would probably just htmlentities() the whole lot of it
2016-02-24 18:53:16	gnarface	not let people put unescaped html into any submissions
2016-02-24 18:53:28	Sik	<Samsai> but all articles from non-editors are screened ← Question
2016-02-24 18:53:37	Sik	What if the script runs when an editor is screening them?
2016-02-24 18:53:43	gnarface	then the javascript would render as plain text instead of execute, and these script kiddies would just look like punks
2016-02-24 18:53:51	Sik	I.e. it wouldn't be to the public but could still be to GOL staff
2016-02-24 18:53:58	Sik	Oh OK
2016-02-24 18:53:59	@Samsai	Sik, the javascript would execute and the editor is potentially in risk
2016-02-24 18:54:04	Sik	Oh
2016-02-24 18:54:06	Sik	:/
2016-02-24 18:54:11	Sik	Well that's still an issue

2016-02-24 18:54:30	gnarface	there's a number of ways to address it simply
2016-02-24 18:54:30	Sik	...could probably just do a dumb replace of "<script>" with "&lt;script&gt;"
2016-02-24 18:54:41	Sik	That'd probably break any attempts to do that
2016-02-24 18:54:59	Sik	(OK, maybe do the same with </script> too for the sake of consistency)
2016-02-24 18:55:04	Sik	Actually, <script not <script>
2016-02-24 18:55:05	gnarface	you'd have to replace a number of syntactically valid similar things
2016-02-24 18:55:06	Sik	Point stands
2016-02-24 18:55:32	Sik	But preventing the opening script tag from being parsed would pretty much nullify the issue even if the end result looks ugly
2016-02-24 18:55:34	gnarface	but you could just replace < and > with &lt; and &gt; and then no html tags would render
2016-02-24 18:55:52	Sik	Well I mean replace("<script", "&lt;script")
2016-02-24 18:56:08	gnarface	but some browsers will even execute on "< script"
2016-02-24 18:56:20	Sik	The &lt; would make it not a tag
2016-02-24 18:56:24	gnarface	yea
2016-02-24 18:56:26	gnarface	safer
2016-02-24 18:56:27	Sik	Oh
2016-02-24 18:56:29	Sik	Derp right
2016-02-24 18:56:34	Sik	Spaces are allowed >_>
2016-02-24 18:57:02	Sik	<*whatever is the regex definition for whitespace here*script
2016-02-24 18:57:05	gnarface	also you could put in a number of arbitrary types of unprintable characters instead of whitespace browser would probably ignore during rendering
2016-02-24 18:57:19	Sik	I think that thwarts parsing though
2016-02-24 18:57:35	gnarface	depends on browser, you can't trust them all to follow the w3c specs
2016-02-24 18:57:47	Sik	But you can probably trust GOL editors to not use something shitty...
2016-02-24 18:58:15	gnarface	mostly browsers do a pretty good job of various types of "do what i mean" logic which leaves a lot of sneaky side entrances accidentally exposed
2016-02-24 18:58:15		[18:58]
2016-02-24 18:58:28	gnarface	so like i said, that's why i'd just htmlentities() the whole lot of it, and not allow any tags to render at all
2016-02-24 18:58:36	gnarface	*sanitized*
2016-02-24 18:58:49	Sik	Does it allow rich text?
2016-02-24 18:58:56	Sik	Because if so, that's probably why HTML is allowed
2016-02-24 18:59:09	Sik	You'd need to change the tags to something non-HTML to allow it to keep working
2016-02-24 18:59:09	gnarface	i actually have no idea what the GOL code is doing
2016-02-24 18:59:27	gnarface	oh
2016-02-24 18:59:43	gnarface	yea here, sorry this is what i meant: http://php.net/htmlentities
2016-02-24 18:59:44	GolBot	[ PHP: htmlentities - Manual ]
2016-02-24 19:00:04	gnarface	its a function for scrubbing all the data before the browser even sees it
2016-02-24 19:00:23	Sik	Wouldn't http://php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php be enough?
2016-02-24 19:00:24	GolBot	[ PHP: htmlspecialchars - Manual ]
2016-02-24 19:00:29	Sik	And not go overkill
2016-02-24 19:00:32	Sik	But oh well
2016-02-24 19:00:55	gnarface	yea, htmlspecialchars would be fine too
2016-02-24 19:00:58	gnarface	better perhaps
2016-02-24 19:01:15	gnarface	but probably just more pedantic

2016-02-24 19:02:09	Sik	Yep
2016-02-24 19:02:15	Sik	htmlspecialchars just does the bare minimum
2016-02-24 19:02:24	gnarface	the point is either way, it'll stop article submissions from containing any html formatting, but that's probably for the best, security-wise
2016-02-24 19:02:38	Sik	I should know because I always do function tohtml($str) { return htmlspecialchars($str); }
2016-02-24 19:02:45	Sik	(that name is way too damn long, seriously)
2016-02-24 19:02:52	gnarface	probably only trusted GOL staff should be allowed to personally insert renderable html/javascript into the articles

2016-02-25 13:24:56	gnarface	hey if i've got a motherboard with an onboard nvidia gpu that can't be disabled, can i like, use it to mine for bitcoins or something?
2016-02-25 13:25:13	gnarface	i know it wouldn't get a great keyrate, but its just sitting there sucking up juice anyway
2016-02-25 13:25:23	gnarface	it'd be cool if there were some way to use it as a third processor core
2016-02-25 13:25:54	gnarface	damned thing could probably be used to heat a waterbed too

2016-02-25 19:45:17	Dumle29	for some reason the i7s don't have VT-d, but the i5s do
2016-02-25 19:45:24	drumr	oh yeah. the k series processors dont support vt-d until the 5xxxx series
2016-02-25 19:45:29	drumr	no wait 4790k

2016-02-25 19:48:59	drumr	low settings of course
2016-02-25 19:49:01	drumr	320mb
2016-02-25 19:49:10	drumr	i should have spent the extra 50-100 for the 640
2016-02-25 19:49:11	Dumle29	660 ti goes pretty well stilll
2016-02-25 19:49:13	drumr	mb

2016-02-25 19:49:25	drumr	yeah the gtx was fine

2016-02-25 19:49:49	drumr	i stil have that card and its in use still

2016-02-25 19:50:15	tumocs	meh, now I enjoy my r7 260x with radeonsi

2016-02-25 19:50:53	Dumle29	i3 4370 with 970 usually provides great value

2016-02-25 19:54:00	Dumle29	drumr: Because seing the gts series again made me think back to first pc time
2016-02-25 19:54:07	Dumle29	back when ATI wasn't AMD :P
2016-02-25 19:54:20	drumr	oh
2016-02-25 19:54:43	drumr	my first video card was a evga +4 vtech expansion card in a computer

2016-02-25 19:54:52	Dumle29	oh shiet. You win
2016-02-25 19:54:54	drumr	back in 1990

2016-02-25 19:55:10	drumr	then we had a trident 2mb expandable to 8mb back in 94
2016-02-25 19:55:29	Fenix2412	Hmm
2016-02-25 19:55:29	drumr	i forgot what was in our toshiba in 97
2016-02-25 19:55:44	drumr	when i built my first whole computer it was a 120 rage pro
2016-02-25 19:55:46	drumr	128
2016-02-25 19:55:48	Fenix2412	AMD Sempron 3000+ and ATI Radeon 9600
2016-02-25 19:56:10	Fenix2412	My first pc
2016-02-25 19:56:25	drumr	yeah i had the all in wonder 9600 xt
2016-02-25 19:56:30	drumr	after the rage
2016-02-25 19:56:50	Dumle29	I'm actually only on my 3rd PC
2016-02-25 19:56:50	drumr	although i had a couple other computers that i didnt use for gaming that i didnt pay attention to
2016-02-25 19:56:58	Dumle29	well, desktop
2016-02-25 19:57:10	drumr	ive had this cpu/mobo/memeory combo since march 2010
2016-02-25 19:57:26	drumr	ive upgraded video cards and hard drives
2016-02-25 19:57:32	drumr	im still using the blu ray burner i bought
2016-02-25 19:57:37	Dumle29	first one I built, then when that died, got a pavilion slimline (oh god why?), and then I built my now 5 year old desktop
2016-02-25 19:57:37	drumr	i think in 2007
2016-02-25 19:58:08	drumr	yeah i would have upgraded my cpu etc before but this has run well and continues to do so with an ssd
2016-02-25 19:58:23	drumr	the problem i have is the mobo needs to be replaced but to get another 1366 is really expensive
2016-02-25 19:58:32	drumr	almost as much as i paid for mine new or double
2016-02-25 19:59:05	Dumle29	yeah, if mobo needs to go, it's more reasonable to go for a mobo+cpu upgrade
2016-02-25 19:59:17	Dumle29	same for cpu
2016-02-25 19:59:18	drumr	yeah my bios wont work right
2016-02-25 19:59:27	drumr	it keeps resetting my settings back to factory bios
2016-02-25 19:59:31	drumr	checksum errors
2016-02-25 19:59:39	Dumle29	drumr: Get a new cmos battery?
2016-02-25 19:59:48	drumr	it will keep my settings but says there was an error overclocking and thats not the case
2016-02-25 19:59:55	drumr	nope that doesnt do it
2016-02-25 19:59:57	Dumle29	though that battery should stay fine for 10 years
2016-02-25 20:00:01	Dumle29	it's getting close
2016-02-25 20:00:01	drumr	i do have a broken pci-e slot
2016-02-25 20:00:04	Dumle29	ah
2016-02-25 20:00:07	drumr	the plastic is broken
2016-02-25 20:00:17	drumr	i had to ship my computer 3 years ago back to me
2016-02-25 20:00:36	drumr	my case side fan casing is partially broken too
2016-02-25 20:02:48	drumr	ive had this case since i got my e6600 then q6600 in 2006
2016-02-25 20:03:08	drumr	i want one that has hard drive slots where the connectors face the door

2016-02-25 22:23:39	ephja	you're right, but everything takes ages in most MMOs
2016-02-25 22:26:17	ephja	sziszi: NWN is alright. I just prefer real-time combat. I did get my ass kicked by starting on hard, but I guess that constitutes as challenging :p

2016-02-25 23:27:09	kkit	fuck the pi, there are way better boards out there now
2016-02-25 23:27:33	kkit	isn't the pi still locked down broadcom crap? do they still hide the hardware video decoding behind money?
2016-02-25 23:27:44	gnarface	yep
2016-02-25 23:28:18	gnarface	and you have to pay extra to unlock the mpeg2 decoder
2016-02-25 23:28:23	kkit	the odroid c2 gives you a lot more hardware for the money
2016-02-25 23:28:30	kkit	iirc it'll release next month
2016-02-25 23:28:57	gnarface	but will it run linux?

2016-02-25 23:30:41	kkit	so i guess it's not as open as it could be
2016-02-25 23:30:54	drumr	pi has amplifier options through other parties
2016-02-25 23:30:56	kkit	but it seems better than broadcom

2016-02-25 23:31:18	kkit	all hardware has amplifier options if you're amping line-out
2016-02-25 23:31:31	gnarface	hmm. the odroid c2 looks pretty nice actually, but i really need something like this with more ethernet ports.  and i certainly don't need 6 USB ports... i'd trade 5 of them for just 2 more ethernet ports
2016-02-25 23:32:01	drumr	yeah they need to go out to music systems in locations
2016-02-25 23:32:08	drumr	some have amps already most dont
2016-02-25 23:32:51	drumr	this odroid looks good
2016-02-25 23:32:52	drumr	thanks
2016-02-25 23:32:56	@Samsai	gnarface, usb-to-ethernet?
2016-02-25 23:33:05	gnarface	Samsai: not worth the trouble or the cost
2016-02-25 23:33:15	kkit	np, i love my xu4 and i definitely want a c2 to play with when it releases
2016-02-25 23:33:32	gnarface	Samsai: usb-to-ethernet devices tend to be janky and poorly supported
2016-02-25 23:33:40	@Samsai	entirely possible
2016-02-25 23:34:11	@Samsai	i've heard some people have made raspi routers with those USB ethernet things
2016-02-25 23:34:23	drumr	xu4 looks good too
2016-02-25 23:35:07	gnarface	Samsai: yea, but the pi only has one USB bus, not pci, and its only USB 1.0, so it makes a really pathetic router if you want more than 10 megabits of bandwidth
2016-02-25 23:36:35	kkit	i'm pretty sure the pi is usb 2
2016-02-25 23:36:48	drumr	oh i like the usb audio adapter
2016-02-25 23:36:52	kkit	but that the issue was the ethernet on the pi is attached over usb2 already
2016-02-25 23:38:27	gnarface	well they all share the same bus and its not PCI,
2016-02-25 23:38:49	ky0	Doing interviews is a weird thing
2016-02-25 23:38:55	ky0	it is very very weird
2016-02-25 23:39:02	gnarface	maybe the bottleneck isn't the USB spec it uses, but the bus
2016-02-25 23:39:37	kkit	i think the bus was the bottlneck
2016-02-25 23:40:14	kkit	it couldn't handle big usb disk transfers over ethernet that well. transfers were sloooooow
2016-02-25 23:41:25	gnarface	and then there's the problem where it can't handle full spec USB2 power to its own usb ports, so pretty much anything that draws more juice than a wireless keyboard needs its own powered hub or it just freezes the thing
2016-02-25 23:42:26	kkit	really the pi just had timing on its side
2016-02-25 23:42:42	drumr	yeah
2016-02-25 23:42:47	drumr	did you see the pine a64?
2016-02-25 23:42:49	kkit	it was the first to be inexpensive and not shitty
2016-02-25 23:43:21	gnarface	the on-chip h264 decoder looks real nice
2016-02-25 23:43:29	gnarface	shame about the shady closed-source drivers
2016-02-25 23:44:01	gnarface	it can play surprisingly high-res video with that decoder, despite the really weak cpu
2016-02-25 23:44:07	kkit	yeah but not like that's much different from what you already have to deal with
2016-02-25 23:44:08	gnarface	it was a hell of a hat trick engineering wise

2016-02-25 23:47:01	drumr	that might not be an issue
2016-02-25 23:47:15	gnarface	what would be nice for me right now is something ARM with 4 full-bandwidth gigabit ethernet ports.  it doesn't even need a soundcard
2016-02-25 23:47:16	drumr	i priced out what we need for the pi and it was about 125-150
2016-02-25 23:47:27	drumr	yeah
2016-02-25 23:47:57	gnarface	frankly, i wouldn't even need a processor really any faster than the one in the pi
2016-02-25 23:48:14	gnarface	but it'd be nice if it was something there were debian/devuan kernels for
2016-02-25 23:48:30	gnarface	the other pain in the ass about the pi is having to have a custom kernel for the fpu
2016-02-25 23:48:47	gnarface	just because nobody is building for that configuration
2016-02-25 23:49:27	gnarface	although i guess i'm talking about the model 1 pi here, maybe that's not an issue with the pi 2
2016-02-25 23:49:45	kkit	i actually want a c2 to see how it might hold up as an htpc
2016-02-25 23:50:31	kkit	some of my friends run xbmc or one of those other frontends on their pi and while video decoding is fine, they complain about laggy menus
2016-02-25 23:50:51	gnarface	i'm not familiar with that mali thing. google told me its a mali 400 not 450 (but 440 mhz)
2016-02-25 23:51:00	gnarface	on the c2
2016-02-25 23:52:54	kkit	it's one of the video accelerators you see on cell phones a lot
2016-02-25 23:53:07	kkit	so plenty beefy for decoding video
2016-02-25 23:55:08	Smilex	I love the art style of Factorio. Anyone here who has an opinion on the gameplay?

2016-02-26 06:51:26	magamo	That right there is probably why -- They can just release the Windows version for Windows, and they don't want to have to package a wrapper for Mac/Linux only.

2016-02-26 06:59:40	magamo	I've had no issues with either.  Which games are you having issue with under Dosbox?
2016-02-26 07:00:05	stqn	magamo: the "pinball gold pack" from GOG most notably.
2016-02-26 07:00:08	magamo	Well, Wine it's really, really game dependant, and of course, API dependant as well.

2016-02-26 07:09:52	magamo	Of course, for all I know, the vsync settings might also be Windows only.
2016-02-26 07:11:16	qptain_Nemo	either way thanks for bringing it up, i'll research it more at some point

2016-02-26 07:11:44	qptain_Nemo	although tbh i don't really care, i just made an exception in nvidia settings and it's fine
2016-02-26 07:11:51	magamo	Yeah, looks like vsync is only available via patches to dosbox.
2016-02-26 07:12:04	qptain_Nemo	but i just think it's unacceptable for a modern application to not be compatible with vsync
2016-02-26 07:12:08	stqn	hm ah you can set vsync per game in the nvidia settings? interesting
2016-02-26 07:12:22	stqn	there are still some games without a vsync option…
2016-02-26 07:12:24	qptain_Nemo	yeh you can override the vsync setting per any application

2016-02-26 07:13:09	stqn	I see. I don’t really want to do that…
2016-02-26 07:13:55	qptain_Nemo	why?
2016-02-26 07:14:25	@Samsai	vsync is not always desirable
2016-02-26 07:14:49	@Samsai	mesa really wants to vsync absolutely everything on my system so i occasionally have to force it to not vsync to gain extra frames
2016-02-26 07:14:57	qptain_Nemo	well that's why i have exceptions :V

2016-02-26 07:16:53	@Samsai	personally i would rather have vsync disabled by default because i am lazy and don't want to force it via environmental variables
2016-02-26 07:17:30	@Samsai	but i am also too lazy to go digging to figure out how to disable it by default so i just end up using the environmental variables

2016-02-26 07:20:54	qptain_Nemo	i see
2016-02-26 07:21:30	stqn	also it would screw up benchmarks… and I already have compton to get rid of tearing.
2016-02-26 07:22:05	qptain_Nemo	i actually ended up going back to xfce compositor after adding the forcecompositionpipeline option ¬_¬
2016-02-26 07:22:29	stqn	makes sense
2016-02-26 07:22:45	stqn	I haven’t made the move to ForceCompositionPipeline yet, too much work for too little gain :p

2016-02-26 07:26:07	xpander69	with compton it tears when recording..well the output video does.
2016-02-26 07:26:16	stqn	ah yes, but I don’t record :)
2016-02-26 07:26:37	xpander69	well its mostly fine then.. except a bit slower window movement in desktop
2016-02-26 07:26:47	xpander69	but if you dont move them all the time then its nothing to worry about

2016-02-26 09:21:36	openfbtd	Superhot just released
2016-02-26 09:21:41	openfbtd	Missing executable for linux
2016-02-26 09:22:04	@Samsai	apparently people don't like the superhot EULA
2016-02-26 09:22:28	kkit	who reads those
2016-02-26 09:22:37	@Samsai	i dunno, some people i guess
2016-02-26 09:23:20	@Samsai	i read the EULA for neon struct and eldritch but mainly because they are short and someone told me they were awesome
2016-02-26 09:25:12	openfbtd	Huh, EULA is insane, yeah

2016-02-26 09:31:32	openfbtd	It's just worded in an insane way
2016-02-26 09:31:42	@Samsai	and you only have the game installed on one computer
2016-02-26 09:31:43	openfbtd	Looks like their lawyer is a moron
2016-02-26 09:32:13	openfbtd	I also doubt they will actually go after you if you install the game on two+ *personal* machines
2016-02-26 09:32:20	openfbtd	But yeah, that's shifty
2016-02-26 09:32:27	@Samsai	they forgot to translate the insanity into legal jargon
2016-02-26 09:32:41	@Samsai	that's the problem
2016-02-26 09:32:47	openfbtd	Also SUPERHOT is not the only game that has that shit in the EULA
2016-02-26 09:33:00	openfbtd	A few EA games explicitly say you can't install on more than one machine

2016-02-26 09:35:02	openfbtd	Because they fucked up the linux release

2016-02-26 11:17:53	stqn	I find the price a bit steep for an untextured game
2016-02-26 11:18:27	stqn	(and by untextured I really mean … basic… no story, indie, la la la.)
2016-02-26 11:30:14	stqn	ok, I read in a review that there is a story.
2016-02-26 11:30:57	openfbtd	Hi stqn, you have to check out this game. It's the most innovative shooter I've played in years.

2016-02-26 11:58:54	openfbtd	I'm saying this now though: if you want a long story with lots of content — don't buy it
2016-02-26 11:59:05	openfbtd	The meat is in the challenges and endless mode
2016-02-26 12:00:16	stqn	ok

2016-02-26 12:10:07	stqn	I am not interested in endless modes though.

2016-02-27 01:38:21	anonkun	the thing that steam controller hopes to improve
2016-02-27 01:38:57	anonkun	driving and stuff is more fun with a controller though
2016-02-27 01:39:12	anonkun	is there any 2 player type game like skullgirls which needs a controller on linux?
2016-02-27 01:39:52	magamo	Hmmm.  Skullgirls itself can use gamepads.

2016-02-27 01:41:27	magamo	Gotcha.  Hmmm.  I'm pretty sure that Street Fighter V will be able to utilize it. ;-)  Towerfall: Ascension works quite well with gamepads, and has local multiplayer.

2016-02-27 01:44:34	anonkun	Pro Evolution Soccer :P
2016-02-27 01:44:37	homerj	you know, I wonder how much of a "cheat" it would be in SFV to use a Steam Controller
2016-02-27 01:44:48	homerj	press X to Combo
2016-02-27 01:44:54	magamo	Trine 3 is part of the currnet Humble Bundle.
2016-02-27 01:45:07	anonkun	ah lemme check

2016-02-27 01:46:56	anonkun	right?
2016-02-27 01:46:58	homerj	I'd buy PES for Linux
2016-02-27 01:47:04	homerj	did they ever fix it?
2016-02-27 01:47:17	anonkun	no idea, I generally play FIFA, but I know EA.
2016-02-27 01:47:22	magamo	Humble Bundles come with Steam Keys in 90% of cases.
2016-02-27 01:47:26	homerj	I used to be a huge PES player, then when they went to the "next gen" ps3 versions, they became kind of awful
2016-02-27 01:48:16	magamo	Though, I'm still annoyed that Torchlight I and Jamestown never got onto Steam for Linux.
2016-02-27 01:48:25	homerj	the last PES game I really enjoyed was probably PES 6
2016-02-27 01:48:37	anonkun	humble bundle games can't be redeemed to steam can they?
2016-02-27 01:48:54	homerj	yeah, I think you have to pay $1 to get steam keys or something
2016-02-27 01:49:00	homerj	like total for the bundle
2016-02-27 01:49:35	anonkun	hmm
2016-02-27 01:50:04	anonkun	I'll just wait for a steam sale and spend the money on all the games i would play.

2016-02-27 02:46:33	stqn	Most games that require pressing a number key to do something don’t recognize these key presses.

2016-02-27 02:47:44	stqn	it’s ok for games with only a few actions…
2016-02-27 02:47:53	Smilex	It's solved by not treating input as text, but instead as actions. So input should be scancodes, and text input should be the regular
2016-02-27 02:48:48	Smilex	There's a very important distinction in saying "I want to move forward" and "I want to press W"
2016-02-27 02:49:15	stqn	they can solve it however they want as long as it works.

There were many screaming fits while he got used to the GIMP and Inkscape, but he is getting dangerously good with them now. The talented bastard makes me jelous :P. The biggest fuck up is that the only thing that seems to offer any kind of CMYK support is Kryta, which runs like shit atm. Mention CMYK to GIMP and it just sticks its fingers in its ears

2016-02-27 19:56:17	No1RL355	when you lives in country, where you cant use bitcoins, cuz its "money surrogate and will crush country's economics" - you stops listen laws
2016-02-27 19:56:41	DerRidda	Nazi Germany made a lot of things illegal for Jews, that didn't make it right, in the end being one was basically illegal. The law is not good and just, simply because it is he law.
2016-02-27 19:56:56	DerRidda	the*
2016-02-27 19:57:07	sziszi	DerRidda, agreed
2016-02-27 19:57:37	No1RL355	frankyboy_, idk about your language, but, in russian, there is difference between being good citisen and good man
2016-02-27 19:57:40	frankyboy_	No1RL355, show me official document that states your assumption
2016-02-27 19:57:43	AciD`	you don't stop to 'listen laws' if they are dumb, you voice your discontent, then you change them.
2016-02-27 19:58:02	frankyboy_	DerRidda, illegal from which point of view?
2016-02-27 19:58:19	No1RL355	AciD`, you cant change anything in country with censore and propaganda actually
2016-02-27 19:58:45	DerRidda	There is only one definition of illegal and that is the judicial one.
2016-02-27 19:58:45	No1RL355	only escape it, but its hard, if you have no experience at work and finished no university
2016-02-27 19:58:52	AciD`	tumocs -> I got bored to wait for the git clone to dl, and remembered I own many vps. logged into one, dled the thing is litterally 3 sec.
2016-02-27 19:58:54	AciD`	:_|
2016-02-27 19:59:09	frankyboy_	No1RL355, then you need to look at usa where good citizen is good man ;) that is civil society :)
2016-02-27 20:00:01	frankyboy_	DerRidda, if there were such laws, so it was legal in nazi germany, also as was legal concetration camps in usa for japanees
2016-02-27 20:00:03	AciD`	better take a look at northern europe countries
2016-02-27 20:00:10	No1RL355	frankyboy_, good citisen = someone, who lives by laws. Good man = someone, who lives by... emmh... how its word... conscience
2016-02-27 20:00:16	AciD`	usa is just as anti-democratic as russia, imho
2016-02-27 20:00:20	sziszi	in Hungary it's forbidden to make evidence, or even to have one against somebody. So if you make an audiofile which can get someone dirty, you'll end in prison, not the criminal
2016-02-27 20:00:21	No1RL355	I think, its right word
2016-02-27 20:00:24	AciD`	(ok, almost as)
2016-02-27 20:00:31	DerRidda	frankyboy_: I never argued that but it was never the right thing.
2016-02-27 20:00:56	No1RL355	you may be good citisen and good man both only in country with ok laws
2016-02-27 20:00:57	AciD`	sziszi -> really?, sounds weird
2016-02-27 20:01:09	No1RL355	but not in one, where github and wikipedia was banned once
2016-02-27 20:01:13	frankyboy_	DerRidda, i didn't say that it is right, but law is law... in democratic state law is changed, in non-democratic not
2016-02-27 20:01:47	frankyboy_	No1RL355, show me russian law where legal 2d porno is prohobited
2016-02-27 20:02:09	*	No1RL355 googled "prohobited"
2016-02-27 20:02:20	@Samsai	laws are for people with a serious lack of nuclear weapons
2016-02-27 20:02:47	frankyboy_	prohibited*
2016-02-27 20:02:48	DerRidda	Prohibiting legal things... that's now how this works, that's not how any of this works.
2016-02-27 20:03:15	No1RL355	http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)?OpenAgent&RN=113185-6 this one, I think
2016-02-27 20:03:23	DerRidda	Prohibition, by definition, makes things illegal (to have, sell, distribute etc).
2016-02-27 20:03:23	sziszi	AciD`, yep. Some politician caught red handed in some corruption; even an audiofile as an evidence. They imprisoned the witnesses because they claims were false, called the audiofile manipulated; the made this weird law

2016-02-27 20:11:51	openfbtd	It's just cartoons drawn fucking ffs
2016-02-27 20:11:55	frankyboy_	openfbtd, but  molestation and porno is different things

2016-02-27 20:12:51	DerRidda	Again, expect Russian law to be crafted into a weapon where everyone is in a state of perpetual illegal activity. even if a lot of it is not enforced, it always could be when the powers that be need it.
2016-02-27 20:12:55	No1RL355	they have nude bodies too

2016-02-27 20:25:20	No1RL355	there should be better example, I think, but you right m8
2016-02-27 20:25:26	No1RL355	anyways
2016-02-27 20:25:29	openfbtd	frankyboy_, that's the point. Quite often teenage girls are fully formed women physically
2016-02-27 20:25:41	openfbtd	They have all the right curves
2016-02-27 20:25:43	No1RL355	DerRidda, as I said, its hard to find work in other country without experience
2016-02-27 20:25:50	openfbtd	So you react to them, on a primal level
2016-02-27 20:25:55	No1RL355	and much harder, if you have problems with health
2016-02-27 20:25:55	frankyboy_	openfbtd, but still there is law definition of pedophilia
2016-02-27 20:26:21	openfbtd	It's not shameful to have those feelings. It's irresponsible (and illegal) to fuck a 15 y.o. girl if you're an adult

2016-02-27 20:27:05	openfbtd	There is a huuuuuge difference between “my dick got hard because I looked at a teenager” and “I raped one”
2016-02-27 20:27:07	DerRidda	No1RL355: True but that can be fixed. Just remember that there were days when they didn't let you leave and with all that's happening we might see that happen again.
2016-02-27 20:27:59	openfbtd	There is just as much difference between a paedophile jerking it to lolicon and a child molester btw.
2016-02-27 20:28:22	No1RL355	DerRidda, ikr. But wishes arent enough power sometimes and wont fix all problems constantly :D
2016-02-27 20:28:26	openfbtd	I suspect that if we take drawn kids from them, they will go molest real ones
2016-02-27 20:28:29	openfbtd	Well
2016-02-27 20:28:32	openfbtd	Most won't
2016-02-27 20:28:34	openfbtd	Some will
2016-02-27 20:29:36	openfbtd	But no one gives a shit about that. No, it's all knee-jerk reactions: “fucking kids is bad, so anything depicting fucking kids is also bad”
2016-02-27 20:29:51	openfbtd	It's the same thought process modern progressives display
2016-02-27 20:30:07	openfbtd	“Misogyny and racism are bad, so you can't depict them”
2016-02-27 20:30:23	openfbtd	Society is going to shit :<
2016-02-27 20:30:30	No1RL355	not everywhere
2016-02-27 20:30:38	No1RL355	but yep
2016-02-27 20:31:11	openfbtd	Seriously, I think that there is a huge number of people, including ones in power, who can't distinguish reality and fiction
2016-02-27 20:31:19	openfbtd	Like, genuinely can't
2016-02-27 20:31:32	openfbtd	For them depiction of *thing* IS *thing*
2016-02-27 20:31:55	openfbtd	It's like we have an epidemic of insanity
2016-02-27 20:32:09	openfbtd	Schizophrenia.
2016-02-27 20:32:47	No1RL355	its more smthing like thinking instead (not corrent word) of others. Just like "Only I dont like it, but I dont care about others opinion and will outlaw it anyways"

2016-02-27 20:34:31	frankyboy_	openfbtd, depends on society tho
2016-02-27 20:35:29	openfbtd	No1RL355, I'm obviously being funny a bit. But these people use arguments that make them seem schizophrenic.
2016-02-27 20:35:37	openfbtd	I like pointing that out.

2016-02-27 20:36:36	openfbtd	I read that as “blows himself”

2016-02-27 20:37:17	openfbtd	That is a utopia. People will always claim their feelings matter for some reason
2016-02-27 20:37:27	openfbtd	And others will agree

2016-02-27 20:37:54	openfbtd	Well, no. Crybullies
2016-02-27 20:37:58	No1RL355	Its ok to have feelings and tell em, if someone asks you about
2016-02-27 20:38:01	openfbtd	Because, you see, only my fee-fees matter
2016-02-27 20:38:04	openfbtd	Not yours
2016-02-27 20:38:09	openfbtd	BEcause fuck you, that's why

2016-02-27 20:38:54	openfbtd	But the ones who behave like sociopaths are seen as normal people

2016-02-27 20:42:59	openfbtd	RADICAL CHANGE OF DISCUSSION TOPIC: I like how modern horror plays with video distortion.
2016-02-27 20:43:12	No1RL355	its hard to ignore others irl, if you have empathy :D
2016-02-27 20:43:36	openfbtd	I love it to bits, especially when said horror incorporates actual monitors with video playing
2016-02-27 20:43:53	No1RL355	video distortion eats lot of frames
2016-02-27 20:43:57	No1RL355	:/
2016-02-27 20:44:01	openfbtd	They blur the line between what's on your screen and what isn't
2016-02-27 20:44:20	No1RL355	and it hurt for eyes btw
2016-02-27 20:44:22	openfbtd	By showing you the same distortions on the screens in games/movies
2016-02-27 20:44:28	openfbtd	And in “the real world”
2016-02-27 20:44:34	openfbtd	As in the world of the movie
2016-02-27 20:44:52	openfbtd	No1RL355, no, I mean how they show ghosts distorted and jumpy
2016-02-27 20:44:57	No1RL355	ah
2016-02-27 20:45:16	openfbtd	Like they are something the vido recording hardware is struggling to record even
2016-02-27 20:45:33	openfbtd	And then they show the same distortions in the movie world
2016-02-27 20:45:51	openfbtd	Thus blurring the line between what's real and what's not
2016-02-27 20:46:00	openfbtd	It should be really effective on people
2016-02-27 20:46:11	openfbtd	I don't get scared from movies :<
2016-02-27 20:46:24	openfbtd	Still like horror though. The more style it has, the better
2016-02-27 20:46:44	openfbtd	American remakes of japanese horrors tend to ooze style
2016-02-27 20:46:51	No1RL355	Im developed games a bit. Cant enjoy horrors then
2016-02-27 20:47:22	No1RL355	you arent afraid, if you know, its just a model
2016-02-27 20:47:39	openfbtd	Well. That's because you can distinguish reality from fiction
2016-02-27 20:47:48	openfbtd	I can, too, even without such experience
2016-02-27 20:48:04	openfbtd	What's on my screen is just what's on my screen. It's not actually happening.

2016-02-27 21:05:02	GermainZ	all the stealth games I play usually have optional stealth

2016-02-27 21:06:34	GermainZ	openfbtd: optional is fine if enemies act realistically IMO and don't forget about you killing 5 of them because you hid for 30s
2016-02-27 21:06:34	openfbtd	No1RL355, thx, will watch
2016-02-27 21:07:03	openfbtd	GermainZ, well yeah. Unfortunately, every game with stealth lately does that shit

2016-02-27 21:07:38	openfbtd	I don't remember btw if enemies just forget about you in Dishonored
2016-02-27 21:07:45	openfbtd	I think they do
2016-02-27 21:07:56	GermainZ	they do IIRC
2016-02-27 21:08:01	No1RL355	Only good stealth is assassin's skill, named "stealth" :/

2016-03-01 09:19:52	disharmonic	For Vulkan i mean
2016-03-01 09:20:39	mirv_	but it's MS - do you truly think they won't try something fishy?
2016-03-01 09:20:49	No1RL355	is vulkan supported now by game engines?

2016-03-01 09:22:02	mirv_	just bundle it with the next battlefield honour medal of code, and everyone will lap it up

2016-03-01 09:22:25	mirv_	No1RL355, vulkan is new...and _much_ lower level than previous APIs
2016-03-01 09:22:47	mirv_	No1RL355, so opengl still has its place...for now
2016-03-01 09:22:49	No1RL355	but looks like it may shot

2016-03-01 09:23:23	mirv_	there's also things like webgl, which you really can't use vulkan to replace
2016-03-01 09:23:36	disharmonic	mirv_: Well DX12 seems to be more or less the same. Besides these days very few devs make their own engine
2016-03-01 09:23:42	mirv_	disharmonic, yep, shine a few lights, distract, and presto!
2016-03-01 09:24:13	mirv_	shit, some people actually use windows 10, despite the best efforts of MS to piss everyone off with it

2016-03-01 12:39:08	NotABot_	How did you figure that out?
2016-03-01 12:40:38	qptain_Nemo	the interface of the site directly mimics twitch, so i copy the line that seems to include the streamer's name and the name of the game. that only gives results in that language though. so i assume OL stands for online and crop the query so it only includes the part with OL in it. google offers the wiki page for Monster Hunter Online for that query
2016-03-01 12:40:50	NotABot_	you're correct
2016-03-01 12:40:58	NotABot_	I also found the download link for the game
2016-03-01 12:40:58	NotABot_	http://mho.qq.com/download.shtml
2016-03-01 12:41:55	NotABot_	k I got the download for it
2016-03-01 12:42:00	NotABot_	Now to see if it works in wine
2016-03-01 12:47:00	NotABot_	How big was twitch in 2005>?
2016-03-01 12:48:08	qptain_Nemo	it was only introduced in 2011
2016-03-01 12:49:12	Sik	Well that answers the question
2016-03-01 12:49:52	NotABot_	I'm checking archive.org to see what came first
2016-03-01 12:50:57	NotABot_	seems panda.tv came in october 2015
2016-03-01 12:53:01	NotABot_	the layout is similar
2016-03-01 12:53:05	NotABot_	Not exactly the same though
2016-03-01 12:53:11	NotABot_	panda seems to have tags on the left hand side

2016-03-01 20:07:30	mirv_	because you might get a chuckle from "that other site"
2016-03-01 20:07:49	@NaughtySquid	yeah i saw a tweet

2016-03-01 20:23:36	@NaughtySquid	spelt Goliath wrong, and one look at it tells you it hasn't been released
2016-03-01 20:23:42	mirv_	there's a shocker
2016-03-01 20:29:19	mirv_	just had that one look, and the lack of price is a dead giveaway
2016-03-01 20:31:07	@NaughtySquid	surly looking at the steam releases and seeing a bunch of titles with no price attached would make you at least click one to see
2016-03-01 20:32:01	mirv_	but the effort involved! moving your hand, clicking a mouse button! provding energy to your brain!

2016-03-01 21:17:28	EddDeDuck	Have a Vive under my desk right now :)
2016-03-01 21:19:07	EddDeDuck	I don’t think it will go mass market (the cables for the headset and sensors will be a pain in many homes) but I think it will be seen as a milestone in the history of VR and having a holodeck style experience.
2016-03-01 21:20:26	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: at the price point it can do one :P

2016-03-01 21:20:57	@NaughtySquid	indeed
2016-03-01 21:21:06	EddDeDuck	as the tech matures things will drop and it will become more mass market

2016-03-01 21:21:53	@NaughtySquid	right, games to test, cya in abit
2016-03-01 21:22:14	EddDeDuck	The best plan to suceed is realise you need to grow from novelty for enthusasts, to high end home entertainment through to mass market.
2016-03-01 21:22:20	EddDeDuck	IMHO anyway
2016-03-01 21:22:23	EddDeDuck	ttyl
2016-03-01 21:25:00	hidekin	DVD and blueray players were also really expensive at release, with time VR will be a lot cheaper I think

2016-03-02 01:48:34	Duion	do you guys think shooters need an option to change FOV? and if what settings should that be?
2016-03-02 01:49:15	@Samsai	Duion, absolutely
2016-03-02 01:49:23	@Samsai	and the FOV should default to 90

2016-03-02 01:49:44	Fenix2412	sooo
2016-03-02 01:49:46	tadzik	absolutely
2016-03-02 01:49:53	Fenix2412	are newest nvidia drivers still buggy?
2016-03-02 01:50:04	Duion	and what range should be able to be set?
2016-03-02 01:50:18	Duion	above 100 it gets really fishy
2016-03-02 01:50:24	tadzik	let people set it if they want to
2016-03-02 01:50:31	@Samsai	some people like the old school 100+ look
2016-03-02 01:50:39	tadzik	in TF2 for example, the UI allows you to go up to 90, but console commands let you go overboard if you want to
2016-03-02 01:50:55	tadzik	I think it's up to 135 or something like that
2016-03-02 01:51:57	@Samsai	the faster the game is the higher you should set the maximum
2016-03-02 01:52:58	Duion	60-120 ?
2016-03-02 01:53:03	Duion	120 is really fishy
2016-03-02 01:53:16	@Samsai	that sounds like a reasonable range
2016-03-02 01:53:18	Duion	will get you motion sick
2016-03-02 01:54:29	Smilex	Anyone here have a few minutes to test out if streaming works from me, in a few mins?
2016-03-02 01:54:31	@Samsai	some people are quite used to super high FOV and they will appreciate devs allowing them to run the game the way they want to
2016-03-02 01:55:26	@Samsai	the most important thing is that it's customizable and goes high enough for those that suffer from simulation sickness
2016-03-02 01:55:31	Smilex	The Witness is the first game that I can't play for very long sessions, most likely due to low FOV
2016-03-02 01:55:52	Smilex	It's weird how much of a difference it actually makes when you are negatively affected by it
2016-03-02 01:56:03	Duion	I can't endure more than 100 fov, it will make me feel sick
2016-03-02 01:56:12	@Samsai	some people get really sick from low FOV
2016-03-02 01:56:18	@Samsai	i just get eye strain
2016-03-02 01:56:26	Duion	that is the other extreme
2016-03-02 01:56:32	Duion	90 is fine
2016-03-02 01:56:39	Duion	70-90

2016-03-02 01:56:46	Smilex	I vary between 90 and 100
2016-03-02 01:57:10	@Samsai	i definitely don't like sub-90
2016-03-02 01:57:28	@Samsai	usually i set the FOV to 90 and play with that
2016-03-02 01:58:12	@Samsai	though i have played games like halo: combat evolved with ridiculously low FOV because apparently i could go into some kind of console gamer mode back in the day
2016-03-02 01:58:46	Smilex	Yeah. I tried some Xbox 360 games recently. Holy shit it's bad
2016-03-02 01:59:26	Duion	but high fov setting will lead to many people maxing it out because it gives a bit of advantage in the game
2016-03-02 01:59:36	Duion	but it does not look nice
2016-03-02 01:59:46	@Samsai	Duion, i would say it's their loss
2016-03-02 01:59:46	Smilex	Duion: Yes people already do that
2016-03-02 02:00:09	@Samsai	we have options menus in games to make those kinds of sacrifices
2016-03-02 02:00:33	Smilex	I think Quake Live at one point supported 180, also called fisheye. I tried it, and it's impossible to use
2016-03-02 02:01:04	Duion	above 100 I get motion sick

2016-03-02 02:02:00	@Samsai	if you don't want the maximum FOV to go beyond 100 it should still be mostly fine
2016-03-02 02:02:06	Smilex	Anyone here as hooked on Factorio as I? I'm looking to potentially start a GOL factorio multiplayer group
2016-03-02 02:02:14	@Samsai	90 is what devs should aim for when it comes to FPS games
2016-03-02 02:02:32	@Samsai	and then allow for slightly more for those that need just a bit more
2016-03-02 02:02:36	Smilex	Is there a good reason to limit it?
2016-03-02 02:02:42	Duion	I'm now only considering to use 60-100 or 60-110 or 60-120
2016-03-02 02:02:55	Duion	yes it looks ugly and makes you feel sick
2016-03-02 02:02:55	@Samsai	Smilex, not really unless it really breaks the engine
2016-03-02 02:03:07	Duion	there are a lot of people who just max every setting and then complain
2016-03-02 02:03:23	stqn	Duion: not a reason to limit the setting for everyone
2016-03-02 02:03:25	Smilex	Duion: you don't have to listen to everybody
2016-03-02 02:03:30	@Samsai	well, those people are a bit silly
2016-03-02 02:03:44	@Samsai	if you mess with the settings you should have a basic understanding of what the settings do
2016-03-02 02:03:48	Duion	you won't believe what kind of people are out there
2016-03-02 02:03:57	stqn	I don’t care about the FOV though, although I did find it a bit small in Mordor. But no sickness…
2016-03-02 02:04:09	@Samsai	most the non-technical people that want to "max out the game" just select the highest preset
2016-03-02 02:04:22	@Samsai	and that should obviously not affect the FOV
2016-03-02 02:04:34	stqn	I also increased it a bit in Alien so the game looked better…

2016-03-02 02:49:46	tadzik	my experiences with wireless routers so far is that if you expect them to actually deliver on the specs and be able to work 24/7 without network crashes, you need some serious military-grade shit

2016-03-02 03:34:53	qptain_Nemo	i see

2016-03-02 03:35:04	Coolgeek	No1RL355: I doubt it :p
2016-03-02 03:35:10	qptain_Nemo	so there is still all that?

2016-03-02 03:35:29	vidje	tadzik, well you get my point :D
2016-03-02 03:35:47	vidje	qptain_Nemo, i think so, haven't looked for updates tho for some time now
2016-03-02 03:35:48	tadzik	well, technically they're ordinary pcs, but so are laptops, and good luck replacing some components in that :)
2016-03-02 03:35:59	vidje	tadzik, i meant ordinary desktop :D
2016-03-02 03:36:02	tadzik	the more compact something is, the more PITA its maintenance becomes
2016-03-02 03:36:27	vidje	i really hate steam on linux, always some game is missing some library
2016-03-02 03:36:28	tadzik	you may theoretically get a steam machine so compact that it has the GPU soldered to the motherboard to save space
2016-03-02 03:36:29	vidje	and what not
2016-03-02 03:36:43	vidje	i just dont understand why don't the game devs ship all thel ibs needed
2016-03-02 03:36:43	tadzik	huh, I don't think I ever got that
2016-03-02 03:36:52	vidje	instead of relying on my pc to have everything
2016-03-02 03:36:53	qptain_Nemo	if i bought a steam machine for *myself* i'd install arch on it anyway :V
2016-03-02 03:37:32	vidje	tadzik, you can buy a relatively compact case that's easy to maintain tho
2016-03-02 03:38:22	tadzik	you can, but will the steam machine manufacterer? :)
2016-03-02 03:38:30	vidje	for example the cm120 advanced one is quite nice

2016-03-02 03:41:32	tadzik	vidje: what I mean is, while it is possible to build a small and hackable steam machine, there is no guarantee that steam machine manufacturers will actually make them hackable while designing them
2016-03-02 03:41:55	tadzik	so the answer to "are steam machines as hackable as regular desktops" is, unfortunatuly, "it depends" ;)
2016-03-02 03:42:15	vidje	yeah I see, but it's still same old desktop pc I suppose?
2016-03-02 03:42:22	vidje	i mean, it should be as easy as opening the case
2016-03-02 03:42:56	stqn	maybe you can open the case, but can’t replace anything.
2016-03-02 03:42:57	vidje	i really don't see how they can prevent people from replacing hardware
2016-03-02 03:43:01	@Samsai	vidje, stuff can be soldered onto the mobo
2016-03-02 03:43:06	tadzik	soldering :)
2016-03-02 03:43:18	tadzik	it's really not different from laptops at all
2016-03-02 03:43:21	stqn	maybe there isn’t enough space for most standard components
2016-03-02 03:43:25	tadzik	both compromise between hackability and space
2016-03-02 03:43:48	vidje	ye but from what i've seen the steam boxes aren't that small :S well who knows
2016-03-02 03:44:02	vidje	i honestly think that there's not point in buying one. ever.
2016-03-02 03:44:04	tadzik	take a look at gigabyte brix, or whatever it was called
2016-03-02 03:44:47	vidje	well brix is something i'd buy for a htpc :D
2016-03-02 03:45:09	vidje	but yeah true, you have a point tadzik
2016-03-02 03:46:02	tadzik	ultimately, steam machines are not standarized enough to speak generally about them, I think
2016-03-02 03:46:39	vidje	well thing with steam box is that it's just a repurposed desktop imo
2016-03-02 03:46:51	vidje	i mean no matter how hard i try i can't perceive it as a console
2016-03-02 03:47:07	vidje	and justify buying one
2016-03-02 03:47:20	vidje	when i can probably build one with higher specs for less money
2016-03-02 03:47:38	vidje	and put windows on it to make sure all games in my library work

2016-03-02 08:55:24	linux_gamer	kkit, only eligible president candidate should be a native

2016-03-02 09:13:38	PaulDana	boomers?

2016-03-02 09:13:50	PaulDana	ah
2016-03-02 09:13:53	kkit	boomers are postwar babies
2016-03-02 09:14:02	kkit	so mid 40s through late 50s
2016-03-02 09:14:04	PaulDana	right my mom was 4 at end of war so was too old
2016-03-02 09:14:19	PaulDana	to be a post-war baby - but basdically the same age as the first of the boomers
2016-03-02 09:15:15	kkit	the millenial label is pretty fuzzy too

2016-03-02 14:48:06	Raven67854	But without proper and easily working optimus they can't offer cheaper laptops with like say a 960m

2016-03-02 14:48:47	Mneuro	I'm talking about the lemur 13

2016-03-02 14:52:41	Mneuro	and it's only $532
2016-03-02 14:52:44	Mneuro	that would destroy the lemur
2016-03-02 14:53:01	Mneuro	it's not 1080p
2016-03-02 14:53:15	Raven67854	Why would it destroy the lemu?
2016-03-02 14:53:21	Gallomimia	wow that's a fairly good deal
2016-03-02 14:53:36	Mneuro	because the lemur is an i3 and 4gb of ram
2016-03-02 14:53:42	Mneuro	an i5/8gb would destroy it
2016-03-02 14:54:10	Gallomimia	are you sure? i mean yes 8>4 but what generation is the i3?
2016-03-02 14:54:12	Mneuro	I wish we could buy that entroware laptop in the US
2016-03-02 14:54:49	Raven67854	Gallomimia, Skylake
2016-03-02 14:54:52	Mneuro	doesn't matter, i3's are basically useless nowadays
2016-03-02 14:55:10	Mneuro	i can't really handle lower than an i5
2016-03-02 14:55:10	Gallomimia	no i think the new generation will destroy that 5th gen i5
2016-03-02 14:55:24	Gallomimia	i can't really deal with consumer grade intel chips anyway :P
2016-03-02 14:55:32	Raven67854	well it's 2 dual cores
2016-03-02 14:55:37	Mneuro	well either way, mostly i was just trying to find other places to buy a nice linux laptop
2016-03-02 14:55:40	Raven67854	e.g. the i3 and i5 in that laptop are both dual cores
2016-03-02 14:55:47	Mneuro	System76 seems like the only option
2016-03-02 14:55:50	Gallomimia	my cpu is amd. i'm not sure i like its thruput. but for intel chips, xeon or better please
2016-03-02 14:56:13	Raven67854	So really no idea which CPU would win
2016-03-02 14:56:30	Raven67854	Probably be about the same
2016-03-02 14:57:34	Raven67854	System76 would be a lot cheaper. If they could mass purchase laptops
2016-03-02 14:57:48	Mneuro	on another topic, I think i'm finally starting to like gnome 3
2016-03-02 14:57:58	Mneuro	I installed Ubuntu Gnome to check it out and I actually like it
2016-03-02 15:00:06	Raven67854	The System76 laptop has better wireless as well

2016-03-02 21:48:20	@NaughtySquid	lol
2016-03-02 21:48:41	@NaughtySquid	maybe if i did twitch chat on my phone

2016-03-02 22:29:06	FutureSuture	http://www.gog.com/game/freedom_planet So apparently this game is on Linux and has been for a while. I only just found out about it since it was featured on GOG's main page.
2016-03-02 22:30:44	@NaughtySquid	anyone want to join me battling Feral in CoH2?
2016-03-02 22:34:39	hidekin	FutureSuture: It's a great game :-) They also added this week a new adventure mode
2016-03-02 22:36:13	FutureSuture	hidekin, I never played a Sonic 2D sidescroller. I like taking things slow, exploring everything, and definitely not rushing things. I am also a fan of 2D sidescrollers, however, especially Metroidvanias. Would you suggest that I obtain this game?
2016-03-02 22:38:58	hidekin	FutureSuture: It's a nice game and the level design is really good. It's a little different than sonic not as fast but the game is really great , I recommend that you watch the WTF video from TotalBiscuit he's a done a great analyse of the game. I would recommend it because the game is awesome but it's not a Metroidvania
2016-03-02 22:41:53	hidekin	FutureSuture: It wasn't a wtf but the video is good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGPe-KewvwQ

2016-03-02 22:47:54	kkit	FutureSuture: sonic is not the game for you if you don't want to rush the whole thing
2016-03-02 22:48:57	kkit	i don't know about freedom planet though.
2016-03-02 22:49:21	oddvar	is it though?
2016-03-02 22:49:29	oddvar	sonic punishes you for rushing sometimes
2016-03-02 22:49:37	oddvar	by random spikes that you cannot anticipate
2016-03-02 22:50:46	FutureSuture	Thanks, hidekin
2016-03-02 22:51:02	FutureSuture	Waiting for kkit and oddvar to finish their discussion
2016-03-02 22:51:04	hidekin	freedom planet is slower than sonic and you explore a little more. The level design is also really good , they a few secrets like in sonic games
2016-03-02 22:51:24	kkit	the worst parts of sonic were the levels with platforms that make you wait
2016-03-02 22:51:34	kkit	and the spike locations were infuriating
2016-03-02 22:52:02	oddvar	yeah. I think sonic should've been designed for rushing
2016-03-02 22:52:05	kkit	it's not a game i would replay
2016-03-02 22:52:09	oddvar	but it's not
2016-03-02 22:52:18	hidekin	I liked in the megadrive that you could use multiple cartige with sonic games :-) It was awesome
2016-03-02 22:52:31	kkit	sonic and knuckles was pretty cool
2016-03-02 22:52:31	oddvar	how did that work?
2016-03-02 22:53:07	kkit	and then you jam /that/ cartridge into your game genie
2016-03-02 22:53:15	kkit	so it's stacked 3-high!
2016-03-02 22:53:18	hidekin	there was an adapter to use some characters from other game and put it in the current sonic game
2016-03-02 22:54:09	hidekin	I didn't own the megadrive but a played it a lot at a friends place :-)

2016-03-02 22:55:18	kkit	how about a super gameboy
2016-03-02 22:55:51	hidekin	Super gameboy was also fun but i didn't buy one it was expensive

2016-03-03 03:21:24	DrMcCoy	So yeah...finnecky
2016-03-03 03:21:32	DrMcCoy	But when it works, it works
2016-03-03 03:21:46	DrMcCoy	Did a whole pass of memtest, no errors
2016-03-03 03:22:53	DrMcCoy	The Torment beta (in Wine) works now as well. There's some slowdowns still (my system is old, after all), and there seems to be a memory leak. Restart works then
2016-03-03 03:23:04	DrMcCoy	(Restart the game, that is, not my system)
2016-03-03 03:23:55	DrMcCoy	Oh. The two old sticks are 667MHz. The new ones are 800MHz. In case that wasn't clear from my lines above
2016-03-03 03:25:23	stqn	oh, too bad there are issues. And without your old sticks?
2016-03-03 03:26:13	qptain_Nemo	it'd seem there are memory leaks in recent versions of unity
2016-03-03 03:26:35	DrMcCoy	Without the old sticks, it works on all boots
2016-03-03 03:26:40	DrMcCoy	And with 800MHz too

2016-03-03 03:27:02	DrMcCoy	So it's basically a trade of between 12GB with some slight issues (and a bit slower), or 8GB with less issue and a bit faster
2016-03-03 03:27:47	stqn	ah good! 8GB should be enough… ;)

2016-03-03 03:28:05	DrMcCoy	I don't think the speed-up to 800MHz would be too noticable, to be frank. And I can live with issues that only show up on a reboot. I don't reboot often
2016-03-03 03:28:27	DrMcCoy	My system is running 24/7, most of the time. Only reboot for kernel upgrades
2016-03-03 03:29:05	DrMcCoy	So I take 12GB with some slight issues. If it's getting too annoying, I can still remove the two old sticks later
2016-03-03 03:29:16	stqn	yeah
2016-03-03 03:29:38	stqn	I’m really ok with 8GB…
2016-03-03 03:30:05	stqn	only ARK requires more (so I haven’t bought it)

2016-03-03 03:30:54	DrMcCoy	Sure, I don't really need it, I think. Well, I've seen Torment dip into the more than 8GB now, what with the leaks
2016-03-03 03:31:17	DrMcCoy	But it's in beta for a reason
2016-03-03 03:31:28	DrMcCoy	They did say it's not optimized yet

2016-03-03 03:36:42	tadzik	8GB was not enough to compile UE4 here
2016-03-03 03:36:54	tadzik	I had to mess with this shitty xml (?) build system to reduce the number of threads
2016-03-03 03:37:11	tadzik	and then it still got stuck compiling shaders, since there was no way to un-parallelize that

2016-03-03 08:01:01	DrMcCoy	For some reason, when I click fullscreen on the YouTube HTML5 player now, Firefox stops updating its contents
2016-03-03 08:01:16	nitroflow	gtx 750 ti
2016-03-03 08:01:17	jordicoma	I don't use mesa, but it's good to try the git version (latest)
2016-03-03 08:01:18	@NaughtySquid	psymin: if people do it a lot and want to, we make them an editor, and then they get access to editor private chat, keys when i dont wanna cover stuff and such
2016-03-03 08:01:35	psymin	cool
2016-03-03 08:01:40	mirv_	nitroflow, interesting, I had thought trine3 crashing was a mesa problem
2016-03-03 08:01:41	DrMcCoy	Only doing the right-click content-menu thing on the tab bar updates the contents then, once for every open/clsoe of the menu
2016-03-03 08:02:08	@Samsai	we also plot world domination in the editors' chat but that's a secret
2016-03-03 08:02:24	nitroflow	mirv_ never had it running since launch
2016-03-03 08:02:37	mirv_	heh, me neither
2016-03-03 08:02:53	psymin	I have an article typed up regarding linux, but not for gaming on linux .. I just don't know where is the best place to post it :P
2016-03-03 08:03:07	jordicoma	DrMcCoy: when youtube switches to full screen, normaly tries to switch the video resolution (going to hd), and then it has to redownload all the buffer
2016-03-03 08:03:49	DrMcCoy	jordicoma: No, I mean, the whole Firefox surface, all the contents of the tab, including the HTML bits, in *all* tabs, suddenly stop updating. Forever, until I restart Firefox
2016-03-03 08:04:09	@Samsai	psymin, well, if it has nothing to do with linux gaming GOL is probably not the right place
2016-03-03 08:04:22	psymin	True :)
2016-03-03 08:04:41	DrMcCoy	So when I scroll a text page, for example, nothing changes. Until I open the right-click context menu, then suddenly it redraws
2016-03-03 08:04:56	@NaughtySquid	stardew valley review "I have 41 hours logged in this game. It came out three days ago."

2016-03-03 08:05:50	jordicoma	DrMcCoy: you could try to disable video hardware acceleration. Sometimes give me problems (not this one).
2016-03-03 08:06:18	DrMcCoy	Hmm, true, might try that
2016-03-03 08:07:26	DrMcCoy	Nope, doesn't seem to change anything
2016-03-03 08:08:23	stqn	nitroflow: oh well Trine 3 works here, Gentoo 64 bit, nvidia 355.11
2016-03-03 08:08:35	stqn	launched from Steam, haven’t tried the DRM-free version.
2016-03-03 08:09:24	jordicoma	DrMcCoy: open in private, disable pluggins, pray, ask google, I don't know. The worst I had was black video or no sound.
2016-03-03 08:09:57	qptain_Nemo	i prefer watching youtube in minitube and vlc :V
2016-03-03 08:10:22	DrMcCoy	jordicoma: Happens in a completely new profile too

2016-03-03 08:12:05	DrMcCoy	Then again, I'm also not really using a stock Firefox, but Debian's Iceweasel
2016-03-03 08:12:15	DrMcCoy	So it might be a Debian patch that introduces that
2016-03-03 08:13:03	DrMcCoy	There was a weird bug with text rendering a few years ago, that turned out to be a bug in pango or was it cairo? One of those libraries

2016-03-03 08:13:44	DrMcCoy	But by default, Firefox compiles its own version of these libraries. So it only happened in distributions that switched to the system libs (which was a configure flag)
2016-03-03 08:16:00	DrMcCoy	Gonna check with my Arch lappy tomorrow...
2016-03-03 08:16:56	jordicoma	DrMcCoy: On arch works fine for me

2016-03-03 13:43:40	fs0ciety	from what i've used I actually like it
2016-03-03 13:44:13	Mneuro	I like mate but compiz is even more crash-happy for me
2016-03-03 13:44:41	Mneuro	it was so bad that just switching from marco to compiz caused my desktop to disapear and I had to manually shut my computer down by holding the power button
2016-03-03 13:44:43	fs0ciety	then use compton
2016-03-03 13:44:59	fs0ciety	dont have to use the compiz window manager
2016-03-03 13:45:33	fs0ciety	personally i've gone down the rabbit hole - I use funtoo - which is you must compile everything from source. haha
2016-03-03 13:46:00	fs0ciety	i guess you could try manjaro

2016-03-03 13:46:26	Mneuro	it's not that arch is hard, it's easy
2016-03-03 13:46:30	Mneuro	I just don't like arch philosophy
2016-03-03 13:46:35	fs0ciety	which is
2016-03-03 13:46:35	Mneuro	and the way they manage their repos
2016-03-03 13:46:43	fs0ciety	and what don't you specifically like about it
2016-03-03 13:46:53	Mneuro	on arch you use Nvidia 361, regardless of it's regressions and bugs, because it is the newest
2016-03-03 13:47:04	fs0ciety	see i refuse to use anything these days that has systemd which is why i went the gentoo/funtoo route
2016-03-03 13:47:10	Mneuro	all packages are that way, and I definitely want some amount of stability on my system
2016-03-03 13:47:39	fs0ciety	thats the great thing about gentoo, you can choose what versions of packages you want :)
2016-03-03 13:47:49	fs0ciety	you can go bleeding edge on some and stable on others

2016-03-03 13:49:12	Mneuro	I'm watching it.  I don't get the humor
2016-03-03 13:49:26	Mneuro	DX12 is going to be a huge improvement over dx9/dx11
2016-03-03 13:50:39	fs0ciety	i must admit the latest nvidia drivers are a bit of a cluster fuck - glvnd was released onto an unsuspecting crowd a bit too early
2016-03-03 13:50:58	fs0ciety	but i guess the reasoning behind it is probably vulkan orientated
2016-03-03 13:51:33	Raven67854	Mneuro, Because nothing they showed required dx12. Everything they showed can easily be done in dx11
2016-03-03 13:52:08	Mneuro	I don't understand, it was talking about performance gain in DX12, which is true
2016-03-03 13:52:23	Raven67854	They could of done that without the comparisons
2016-03-03 13:52:29	Raven67854	The comparison bit is whats so silly

2016-03-03 13:56:07	Mneuro	Right now, probably out of frustration, I'd probably take windows 10's privacy concerns over Unity, gnome, and kde all being a crashtastic mess on linux

2016-03-04 01:57:28	Half-Shot	It really is a huge step up
2016-03-04 01:59:06	Half-Shot	*Though this was on Windows
2016-03-04 01:59:10	Half-Shot	So Idk about Linux
2016-03-04 02:00:50	@Samsai	Half-Shot, i think testing has showed significant performance differences

2016-03-04 02:01:18	@Samsai	so on linux you might have to turn down the settings to reach playable performance
2016-03-04 02:01:57	Half-Shot	Probably :/, source games have issues still.
2016-03-04 02:05:24	Half-Shot	Okay, let's have a test

2016-03-04 02:11:12	Half-Shot	Yeah, averaging around 70fps on xonotic with the same settings I used to bench the 7950

2016-03-04 02:17:11	Half-Shot	So basically probably getting around 70% the FPS my main gpu gets
2016-03-04 02:18:37	EddDeDuck	Intel has grown in leaps and bounds
2016-03-04 02:19:41	Half-Shot	I'm seriously impressed. We are at the point where I'd reccomend them to casual players.

2016-03-04 02:20:32	EddDeDuck	using our games for shader testing etc

2016-03-04 02:21:44	EddDeDuck	They have compute shader support (we even enable it on some games now)
2016-03-04 02:22:31	Half-Shot	Yeah, they've been sneakily doing a ton of work on it.
2016-03-04 02:24:23	Half-Shot	It's really exciting. We can get some really small Steam Machines and longer lasting laptops out of this.
2016-03-04 02:25:41	EddDeDuck	well I just think Intel isn’t somethnig that gets HYPE
2016-03-04 02:25:50	EddDeDuck	everyone is focused on RadeonSi etc

2016-03-04 02:28:39	mirv_	EddDeDuck, I think that's because intel doesn't have a reputation for running the latest & greatest marketing eye-candy
2016-03-04 02:29:03	EddDeDuck	They do a lot fo stuff with Codemasters
2016-03-04 02:29:10	EddDeDuck	to show off some things on the Iris cards
2016-03-04 02:29:20	EddDeDuck	was Windows / DX only though

2016-03-04 02:30:12	mirv_	so they're actually beating radeonsi in that regard
2016-03-04 02:32:15	mirv_	ok, these interviews have got to stop asking me junior grade stuff
2016-03-04 02:33:03	mirv_	I mean, c'mon, if you don't know what "volatile" is used for, why would you be looking for embedded work?
2016-03-04 02:34:09	@Samsai	mirv_, there were zombies named that in dying light
2016-03-04 02:34:18	@Samsai	can i get a job in the embedded industry now?
2016-03-04 02:34:53	mirv_	apparently yes
2016-03-04 02:35:41	mirv_	I already have a job offer that I'm 99% certain I'll take, but I keep interviews lined up until the ink is dry on the contract

2016-03-04 02:37:38	EddDeDuck	You’d be suprised the quality of some applicants for programming jobs
2016-03-04 02:38:12	EddDeDuck	seem to think making a game in UNity at University = being compedant at complex C++ (which is what the real AAA games inductry uses)
2016-03-04 02:38:59	EddDeDuck	Memory usage, pointers, templates you need to be very comfortable with things like that to work on AAA titles especially when porting.

2016-03-04 02:40:24	Half-Shot	Well to be fair, the idea is that the courses teach you programming techniques and you learn the language you need yourself.
2016-03-04 02:40:45	EddDeDuck	I’d argue a little on that
2016-03-04 02:41:07	EddDeDuck	As Java is not a good langauge to use for anything complex
2016-03-04 02:41:25	Half-Shot	Oh yeah, I totally agree there
2016-03-04 02:41:31	EddDeDuck	It’s like they taught you basic English to prepare you for living in Japan.
2016-03-04 02:41:55	EddDeDuck	C++ is a much more useful primary langauge to learn than Java
2016-03-04 02:42:02	EddDeDuck	Yes it’s harder
2016-03-04 02:42:18	EddDeDuck	but it gives you a damn good grounding and moving from C++ to Java feels easy
2016-03-04 02:42:42	Half-Shot	Mm. Well I cheated anyway
2016-03-04 02:42:45	EddDeDuck	bt moving from a kindergarden hand holding langauge like Java to something like C++ is a big leap for most
2016-03-04 02:42:51	mirv_	my last year of uni, they moved away from assembly & C, and went to use java....for Computer Systems Engineering
2016-03-04 02:42:58	Half-Shot	I learned on the job via work experience ;P
2016-03-04 02:43:02	EddDeDuck	what you mean I have to manage memory and pointers :p
2016-03-04 02:43:12	EddDeDuck	no garbage collection?
2016-03-04 02:43:15	EddDeDuck	etc :)
2016-03-04 02:43:21	Half-Shot	Embeddecd C is the best way to learn it imo, you really appreciate the system more
2016-03-04 02:43:32	EddDeDuck	*I have a bias about Java which can show at times :)
2016-03-04 02:44:03	*	FutureSuture can't even wrap his head around Java.
2016-03-04 02:44:06	Half-Shot	I dislike Java, but more to do with the langauge itself. I rather like C#
2016-03-04 02:44:18	mirv_	I have trouble using things like Java and C#, because I keep wanting to do C-style stuff
2016-03-04 02:44:44	mirv_	like getting data over a serial line and just pointing into the middle of a byte array
2016-03-04 02:45:00	TomJepp	EddDeDuck: it's almost like games are performance critical code designed to run on horribly low memory platforms ;)
2016-03-04 02:45:03	FutureSuture	Half-Shot, with the dedicated GPU situation for laptops running Linux being rather poor, it's good to see Intel upping their graphics game as well. Not like I can find a laptop that fits all my requirements AND has an AMD card anyway.
2016-03-04 02:45:39	TomJepp	well, last gen was horribly low memory anyway, but I'm sure they'll have no problems filling the larger memory available on an XB1 or PS4
2016-03-04 02:45:45	Half-Shot	mirv_, I've been using OpenTK quite a bit and that's basically a thin wrapper around OpenGL.
2016-03-04 02:45:51	Half-Shot	So everything is very C style
2016-03-04 02:46:05	Half-Shot	So i've been butchering it and making it objecty.
2016-03-04 02:46:23	mirv_	hehe
2016-03-04 02:46:47	Half-Shot	I did C# for years and years before doing Embedded C. Real shock
2016-03-04 02:47:16	mirv_	yep, that would be
2016-03-04 02:47:57	mirv_	I never had formal training in C#, just picked it up for work
2016-03-04 02:48:06	TomJepp	changing your mindset from coding for a big PC to coding for devices where memory is measured in K is a tricky one

2016-03-04 02:48:29	mirv_	TomJepp, my favourite are devices where memory is measured in B
2016-03-04 02:48:57	TomJepp	mirv_: I can't really think of anything other than AVRs or PICs for that ;)
2016-03-04 02:49:03	mirv_	still managed to write it in C, but was very much considering switching to assembly for it
2016-03-04 02:49:27	mirv_	MSP430, dirt cheap model that was basically a bunch of ADCs
2016-03-04 02:49:35	TomJepp	I've not actually used MSP430 yet
2016-03-04 02:49:44	TomJepp	I keep putting NXP ARM chips in my hobby stuff
2016-03-04 02:49:50	mirv_	it's not bad, but get the IAR compiler if you use them
2016-03-04 02:49:59	mirv_	msp430-gcc is ok, but it doesn't optimise as well
2016-03-04 02:50:24	mirv_	and IAR work around the errata a lot better
2016-03-04 02:50:50	mirv_	of course, IAR is a bit costly for just hobby stuff
2016-03-04 02:50:52	EddDeDuck	Anyone buying a Pi3?
2016-03-04 02:51:16	Half-Shot	I will be at some point.
2016-03-04 02:51:18	calexil	nah
2016-03-04 02:51:22	Cracker	I most likely will as well
2016-03-04 02:51:25	calexil	arduino duo
2016-03-04 02:51:29	Cracker	I have a project in mind that will do great with it
2016-03-04 02:51:35	TomJepp	they apparently get to the point where they thermally throttle EddDeDuck
2016-03-04 02:51:39	Raven67854	Still have my k1/x1 boards
2016-03-04 02:51:44	TomJepp	80C + they throttle quite a bit
2016-03-04 02:51:52	EddDeDuck	yeah I’ve seen that if you max them out for extended periods
2016-03-04 02:52:16	EddDeDuck	will be interesting to see how much that happens in realistic usage
2016-03-04 02:52:31	EddDeDuck	compared to deliberate max all the cores stress test
2016-03-04 02:53:07	Half-Shot	Oh pcworld.com. "Things that will make the RPi 3 better". Windows 10
2016-03-04 02:53:20	EddDeDuck	hahaha
2016-03-04 02:53:25	Half-Shot	>The Pi 3 needs 4GB of ram at least.
2016-03-04 02:53:26	EddDeDuck	pcworld are cute
2016-03-04 02:53:35	TomJepp	the userland is still all 32-bit, isn't it?
2016-03-04 02:53:48	TomJepp	I'm curious as to the performance difference with a 64-bit userland
2016-03-04 02:54:05	EddDeDuck	I’m intersted if anyone gets one so they could run some 265 HAVC decoding see if 1080p/30 is nice and smooth and if that causes thermal throttling
2016-03-04 02:54:29	TomJepp	EddDeDuck: I was wanting someone to try h.264 Hi10P content actually
2016-03-04 02:54:33	EddDeDuck	Apprently the pI3 can handle 1080/30 for HVAC
2016-03-04 02:54:37	Half-Shot	I presume the GPU doesn't have h265 decoders?
2016-03-04 02:54:44	EddDeDuck	No GPU sadly
2016-03-04 02:54:51	EddDeDuck	for HAVC
2016-03-04 02:55:03	EddDeDuck	*H265
2016-03-04 02:55:07	Half-Shot	Dammit, all my totally legal videos are hand coded in h265
2016-03-04 02:55:25	Raven67854	Video Core IV mmmm
2016-03-04 02:56:43	EddDeDuck	Half-Shot that’s why I want someoen to have a look
2016-03-04 02:56:45	Raven67854	Pretty certain you'd crush the poor Pi
2016-03-04 02:56:55	EddDeDuck	Ars stated that 1080p/30 was perfectly OK on Pi3
2016-03-04 02:57:00	EddDeDuck	anything higher was no go
2016-03-04 02:57:15	EddDeDuck	*H265
2016-03-04 02:57:19	Raven67854	Can Ars be trusted?
2016-03-04 02:57:32	Half-Shot	I'm not sure I'd trust Ars. They were the people that benched a steam machine on a unsupported 4k monitor.
2016-03-04 02:57:32	Raven67854	Some Ars writers are pretty stupid
2016-03-04 02:57:33	EddDeDuck	In something liek this I’d usually say yes
2016-03-04 02:57:51	Half-Shot	I might as well order one now.
2016-03-04 02:57:54	EddDeDuck	Linux fans feelings on SteamOS aside
2016-03-04 02:58:10	EddDeDuck	Ars on the technical (not review) side are suually pretty decent
2016-03-04 02:58:23	EddDeDuck	Their none technical stuff like SteamOS I am less liekly to trust them
2016-03-04 02:58:35	EddDeDuck	ANyway if someone does get one let me know
2016-03-04 02:58:44	Raven67854	I can't see a reason to get one
2016-03-04 02:58:45	calexil	on an unrelated note duet is amazing
2016-03-04 02:59:12	EddDeDuck	I run RasPlex with a Lighberry on my main TV and would be interested in upgarding the Pi2 to a Pi3 if I could decode h265 on the Pi instead of transcoding
2016-03-04 02:59:54	EddDeDuck	in other news lightberry is pretty damn cool
2016-03-04 03:00:04	calexil	is it just me or is there barely any AMD driver news EVER?
2016-03-04 03:00:21	calexil	like development progress, or proposed features... like
2016-03-04 03:00:22	calexil	nothing
2016-03-04 03:00:36	calexil	theyare disturbingly silent
2016-03-04 03:01:17	Half-Shot	Well on drivers, the catalyst driver is basically the minimum they can get away with at this point.
2016-03-04 03:01:43	calexil	indeed
2016-03-04 03:01:44	Half-Shot	And on the oss, it's free software. So it's you know, not planned hugeply.

2016-03-04 03:03:53	calexil	too late
2016-03-04 03:03:57	EddDeDuck	I have a 12TB RAID setup which is pretty much full. Took best part of 6 to 9 months to convert my physical disk collection over onto the RAID but it was worth it
2016-03-04 03:04:06	Half-Shot	(is a poor student and cannot afford yearly gpu upgrades)
2016-03-04 03:04:07	Raven67854	Haha no mans sky coming june 22nd

2016-03-04 03:04:15	EddDeDuck	Calaxil should be faster than 15fps :(
2016-03-04 03:04:20	Raven67854	New titan is next month
2016-03-04 03:04:27	Raven67854	I can't wait ^_^
2016-03-04 03:04:30	Half-Shot	Noice EddDeDuck, really hoping to increase my 4TB NAS to something decent in the summer.
2016-03-04 03:04:45	calexil	r9 270 medium settings fglrx crimson 15.203
2016-03-04 03:04:49	EddDeDuck	I’ve stuck with QNAP over the yeahs
2016-03-04 03:04:53	calexil	I get like 8-40 fps
2016-03-04 03:05:10	EddDeDuck	bought one with a none soldered CPU so I coukld upgarde it
2016-03-04 03:05:11	calexil	unplayable for a 60fps purist like myself
2016-03-04 03:05:31	calexil	what are the worst fps killers as far as effects
2016-03-04 03:05:38	calexil	maybe Ill just turn em all off
2016-03-04 03:05:56	TomJepp	EddDeDuck: how do you find the newest QNAP software?
2016-03-04 03:06:00	Raven67854	calexil, Everything
2016-03-04 03:06:00	TomJepp	I haven't used one for a few years
2016-03-04 03:06:04	calexil	lol
2016-03-04 03:06:05	EddDeDuck	Now has an i7 3770 and 16GB which runs 3VM’s family backups and the media center
2016-03-04 03:06:06	Raven67854	disable shadows will be a huge boost calexil
2016-03-04 03:06:15	calexil	ah
2016-03-04 03:06:16	calexil	thought so
2016-03-04 03:06:16	EddDeDuck	QNAP latest softwrae is a little buggy
2016-03-04 03:06:26	Raven67854	disable SSAO, AA, everything!
2016-03-04 03:06:28	calexil	AMD and high def shadows=not so good
2016-03-04 03:06:47	calexil	truth is even on lowest everything
2016-03-04 03:06:51	calexil	its still unplayable
2016-03-04 03:06:55	Raven67854	Bummer
2016-03-04 03:07:01	EddDeDuck	my fans on auto control will spin up to max and I updated the fans with some server grade 3000rpm ones which are super silent at 1000rpm but are like a jet at 3000
2016-03-04 03:07:05	calexil	totally nor ferals fault
2016-03-04 03:07:07	Half-Shot	Nice. I'm running the whole server off the G3258 :P I might have to upgrade it though to deal with the multiple HECV streams.
2016-03-04 03:07:08	calexil	not*
2016-03-04 03:07:21	calexil	its just frustrating to see the gameplayed on windows
2016-03-04 03:07:23	calexil	max settings
2016-03-04 03:07:27	calexil	60fps easy
2016-03-04 03:07:29	EddDeDuck	We tried hard calaxil and sadly it needs compute so no Mesa
2016-03-04 03:07:31	Half-Shot	*HEVC, not the opposing force marines
2016-03-04 03:08:01	calexil	well im on fglrx
2016-03-04 03:08:06	calexil	but i get your meaning
2016-03-04 03:08:36	EddDeDuck	I know I meant fglrx was too buggy and mesa doesn’t havw the features
2016-03-04 03:08:41	calexil	yeah
2016-03-04 03:08:45	Half-Shot	*siiigh*

2016-03-04 03:09:03	Half-Shot	I want amd to just kill off cataylst and do an intel.
2016-03-04 03:09:14	calexil	yeah
2016-03-04 03:09:18	calexil	integrated everything
2016-03-04 03:09:22	calexil	why not
2016-03-04 03:09:23	Half-Shot	I don't know if there even is a catalyst team, given the quality :P
2016-03-04 03:09:32	calexil	theres like 8 people
2016-03-04 03:09:41	calexil	which is the truly dissapointing thing
2016-03-04 03:09:42	Raven67854	Back when I ran AMD then Ati GPU's my desktop lagged
2016-03-04 03:09:57	Raven67854	So I ditched them for Nvidia.. Been smooth sailing ever since
2016-03-04 03:11:38	Raven67854	Used to run these 3rd party drivers. That ran/worked better than ati's
2016-03-04 03:11:44	Raven67854	That guy later got hired by Ati though
2016-03-04 03:12:05	Raven67854	And his drivers got taken down. And Ati's driver quality didn't go up

2016-03-04 03:14:01	calexil	I wanna buy a r9 380
2016-03-04 03:14:05	calexil	for amdgpu support

2016-03-04 03:15:31	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, I dunno
2016-03-04 03:15:45	TomJepp	calexil: that'd be nice. my 7970 needs some linux support that isn't terrible ;)

2016-03-04 03:16:32	sziszi	Raven67854, +1
2016-03-04 03:16:47	TomJepp	my linux box has a NVIDIA GTX 760 at the moment, which works reasonably
2016-03-04 03:16:50	TomJepp	*when not using nouveau
2016-03-04 03:16:59	Raven67854	I don't use FOSS drivers
2016-03-04 03:17:04	sziszi	but im waiting for an opensource AMD gpudriver  .. wet dream, I know
2016-03-04 03:17:19	TomJepp	sziszi: we're more likely to get a workable AMD one than a workable NVIDIA one
2016-03-04 03:17:29	Raven67854	Nvidia's drivers work
2016-03-04 03:17:31	oddvar	someone at FOSDEM were working on one

2016-03-04 03:18:16	Half-Shot	So CPC will only allow me to deliver to the same location as my cards address.

2016-03-04 03:18:19	TomJepp	I have two machines for different gaming at this point ;)
2016-03-04 03:18:19	Half-Shot	WTF
2016-03-04 03:18:30	TomJepp	AMD for windows, NVIDIA for linux ;)
2016-03-04 03:18:32	Raven67854	The Linuxones are fine
2016-03-04 03:20:46	sziszi	If AMD can produce a gpu  and the linux driver (open source/closed whatever, but latter is not preferred)  im sold, but i need at least a 80% performance of a same priced nv card

2016-03-04 03:22:46	Raven67854	Because Nvidia Sucks(tm)
2016-03-04 03:22:48	sziszi	qptain_Nemo, because amd has better floss drivers
2016-03-04 03:23:10	qptain_Nemo	but you just said you'd accept a closed source driver
2016-03-04 03:23:26	sziszi	yep, but still
2016-03-04 03:23:36	Half-Shot	sziszi, for a dedicated streaming box it'l do the job fine.
2016-03-04 03:23:44	sziszi	when the card reach its EOL then I'll have my floss driver
2016-03-04 03:24:21	Raven67854	I don't even keep GPU's long enough for that
2016-03-04 03:25:06	sziszi	Half-Shot, I know, but for a multipurpose box, I'll doubt that... Now I use my SNSV router to do that for me. ( stream,seed,etc)
2016-03-04 03:28:59	Half-Shot	I'll be honest. Emby has an app for samsung TVs which means I can just stream to that.
2016-03-04 03:29:18	Half-Shot	I mainly actually want it to run my games on it as a benchmark machine
2016-03-04 03:30:39	sziszi	on your samsung tv?
2016-03-04 03:31:09	Half-Shot	Yeah, you can get an app to stream from an emby server to the TV.
2016-03-04 03:31:32	Half-Shot	OH, for the Rpi. I just want to put it on my desk and use it to see if I can get my games running at 60 on it.

2016-03-04 11:26:08	fox_	Liquid crystal display
2016-03-04 11:26:35	Smilex	sure, but how does that fit with the "does not work well" clause?

2016-03-04 11:28:23	stqn	different
2016-03-04 11:28:49	stqn	LED or fluorescent is the backlight technology, LCD is the panel
2016-03-04 11:28:56	stqn	LCD doesn’t mean much nowadays.
2016-03-04 11:29:34	stqn	by panel I mean the thing that makes the pixels :p

2016-03-04 16:23:28	von	awesome
2016-03-04 16:23:48	von	so, is nvidia issues still around in 361.28 drivers?
2016-03-04 16:24:01	von	still no Civ5 and many unity games?
2016-03-04 16:24:04	von	*are
2016-03-04 16:24:08	von	durr, needz moar sleep

2016-03-04 16:26:57	von	just got woken up for an emergency, gotta wait a bit =/
2016-03-04 16:27:11	von	but yeah, is that nvidia issue still around?
2016-03-04 16:27:35	von	because I was going to update kernel, and that means I'll have to rebuild the drivers unless the issue has been fixed
2016-03-04 16:29:02	baizon	cant tell, im not using an nvidia card
2016-03-04 16:30:49	Mony	von, what issue? i'm running 361 and tried rust few hours ago and it was working (well its rust and working is not the right term but still :D)
2016-03-04 16:30:58	Mony	rust is unity btw
2016-03-04 16:31:40	von	I'm not really sure if the problem is present in any unity game. Do you, by any chance, own Civ5 or Magicka 2?
2016-03-04 16:31:58	Mony	nope :(
2016-03-04 16:32:10	von	oh well

2016-03-04 16:33:48	gnarface	von: i own civ5 but i have a gtx560Ti so i'm sticking with the 340.xx drivers for the time being
2016-03-04 16:34:05	gnarface	von: last i heard 361.xx was not safe for civ5
2016-03-04 16:34:18	gnarface	von: (but that's hardly the only reason i'm hesitant to upgrade)
2016-03-04 16:34:23	openfbtd	von, btw superhot works on linux now
2016-03-04 16:34:50	openfbtd	They've posted a bugfix thread on steam... and forgot to pin it :D
2016-03-04 16:35:32	openfbtd	Also the linux version does not mention editing replays now
2016-03-04 16:35:46	openfbtd	At least it doesn't confuse people with a non-working feature
2016-03-04 16:36:36	von	holy shit, you're up so early-
2016-03-04 16:36:42	von	wtf happened
2016-03-04 16:37:18	openfbtd	I've been getting up at 8ish for the last couple of days
2016-03-04 16:38:24	von	thanks gnarface
2016-03-04 16:39:48	gnarface	von: no problem. so far NONE of the drivers past 340.xx work better at ANYTHING for me.  in fact, i'd rather be running much older drivers because everything after like i think 318.xx has exhibited horrible compositing glitches, but i have to run 340.xx as the minimum for several of my games

2016-03-04 16:42:39	anonkun	what GPU?
2016-03-04 16:42:44	qptain_Nemo	von: that can happen if you don't have correct lib32 drivers
2016-03-04 16:42:46	anonkun	my gtx 750 ti works fine
2016-03-04 16:42:49	von	gtx970
2016-03-04 16:42:56	von	indeed
2016-03-04 16:43:09	von	I think they've made some changes to the set of packages
2016-03-04 16:43:09	gnarface	von well i was gonna suggest that you switch to whatever nvidia driver version your distro chose for stability, but since you're on arch that advice is probably moot
2016-03-04 16:43:15	von	added some universal lib or something
2016-03-04 16:43:36	anonkun	I'm on arch and its fine, my nvidia
2016-03-04 16:43:57	anonkun	do you have lib32-nvidia-utils?
2016-03-04 16:44:09	 > 	NuSuey (uid3556@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-denjskkljrhruchy) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-03-04 16:44:20	anonkun	and nvidia-utils and nvidia-cg-toolkit
2016-03-04 16:44:24	anonkun	because I have those
2016-03-04 16:44:33	gnarface	lib32-nvidia-utils?? arch still does multiarch support the OLD way? troubling....
2016-03-04 16:44:59	qptain_Nemo	what is the new way?
2016-03-04 16:45:15	anonkun	combine it in 1 package I suppose
2016-03-04 16:45:50	von	ah, forgot about lib32-nvidia-utils, yeah. It was of the old version
2016-03-04 16:46:25	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: instead of having a 64-bit package named "lib32-*" for every 32-bit compliance in the 64-bit distro and visa-versa for 64-bit compliance in the 32-bit version of the distro, they simply manipulate the packages so that you can install 32-bit and 64-bit versions of key components on the other version of the distro
2016-03-04 16:47:26	von	that... actually makes an awful lot of sense
2016-03-04 16:47:44	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: its basically just an issue of not using the same paths for 64-bit and 32-bit versions of various runtime libraries and compile-time dependencies, plus a mechanism to globally enable/disable the feature so you don't do it on accident
2016-03-04 16:48:27	qptain_Nemo	makes sense
2016-03-04 16:49:10	von	there's a workaround for that issue in newer nvidia drivers apparently

2016-03-04 16:57:44	von	they have to maintain separate 32bit-distro and lib64-repo for it, and 64bit-distro and lib32-repo for it
2016-03-04 16:57:58	von	instead of having them not cross paths and support one sets of repos for everything
2016-03-04 16:58:46	hagabaka	they have to maintain the two sets anyway, and the repos is just part of how Arch oranizes packages
2016-03-04 16:59:31	hagabaka	also you can't run 64-bit on a 32-bit system

2016-03-04 23:56:03	mirv_	you know a coding test is run on a windows machine when the sample they give doesn't compile with gcc, and assumes a case-insensitive file system
2016-03-04 23:59:12	@Samsai	mirv_, does it have a system("pause") in there too?

2016-03-05 00:04:42	mirv_	nah
2016-03-05 00:05:06	mirv_	was mostly just header file and include tweaks I had to do to get things running
2016-03-05 00:06:49	Raven67854	Such silly thinking
2016-03-05 00:07:02	mirv_	and I think the later versions of g++ don't really like things such as #include <cassert>
2016-03-05 00:07:32	Cracker	You should give them a list of all the corrections you made to make it cross platform compliant ;)
2016-03-05 00:07:33	EddDeDuck	Assuming case insenstive is pretty uch standard practice in game code
2016-03-05 00:07:42	mirv_	Cracker, heh, I did!
2016-03-05 00:07:52	Cracker	EddDeDuck: all windows programmers code
2016-03-05 00:07:57	mirv_	EddDeDuck, true enough...but this is embedded
2016-03-05 00:08:17	TomJepp	mirv_: my particular annoyance with that at university was when I was given code that would only compile in VC++ 6. in 2008.
2016-03-05 00:08:19	mirv_	I have the question of why I would rather c++ instead of c for embedded
2016-03-05 00:08:25	EddDeDuck	well surely it won’t need to care as it won’t swicth from case insensitve to senstive?
2016-03-05 00:08:46	Raven67854	TomJepp, Really?
2016-03-05 00:08:52	TomJepp	Raven67854: yup.
2016-03-05 00:09:00	mirv_	that's....gross
2016-03-05 00:09:00	Raven67854	TomJepp, Holy hell that's impressive :D
2016-03-05 00:09:23	mirv_	EddDeDuck, for the company, it seems an odd practice
2016-03-05 00:09:39	TomJepp	we had one lecturer who insisted that VC6 was still the best version ever, etc etc
2016-03-05 00:09:43	Raven67854	TomJepp, I remember at uni having to use the 2003 compiler in some course work in my 3rd year. It was 2010. Was just fucking bizzar
2016-03-05 00:09:43	EddDeDuck	Our univcercity we could not learn how to attach a debugger in our C++ opening course as Borland C++ had a 100% blue screen if you tried to use a debugger on NT4 :)
2016-03-05 00:09:45	mirv_	I won't say their name, but I would've thought they had better experience than that
2016-03-05 00:10:01	Raven67854	TomJepp, Did he also love VB6?
2016-03-05 00:10:14	TomJepp	Raven67854: thankfully not. ;)
2016-03-05 00:10:48	Raven67854	My CS studies taught python then C++ for the remaining 3.5 years
2016-03-05 00:11:12	TomJepp	lots and lots and lots of java and then some C/C++
2016-03-05 00:11:26	TomJepp	I have an ingrained hatred of the java class library now
2016-03-05 00:11:34	Raven67854	The assembly courses were neat too
2016-03-05 00:11:39	Raven67854	Because I'm going to use that
2016-03-05 00:12:10	@Samsai	Raven67854, of course
2016-03-05 00:12:16	@Samsai	use assembly, save the cycles
2016-03-05 00:12:33	Raven67854	assembly on x86 is useless
2016-03-05 00:12:41	mirv_	use assembly, don't save the cycles because the compiler does a better job
2016-03-05 00:12:44	TomJepp	s/useless/fun/
2016-03-05 00:12:51	Raven67854	What mirv_ said
2016-03-05 00:12:55	Raven67854	You can't outdo the compiler
2016-03-05 00:12:57	TomJepp	x86 assembly is... interesting. ;)
2016-03-05 00:13:05	Raven67854	If you can then you're a damn monster
2016-03-05 00:13:12	EddDeDuck	OUt doing the compiler depends on the problem
2016-03-05 00:13:13	@Samsai	if you can't outdo the compiler then you are simply not trying hard enough!
2016-03-05 00:13:38	EddDeDuck	we’ve found some stuff with intrinsics and gcc that are TERRIBLE with the compiler and a simple bit of assembly would be factotrs faster
2016-03-05 00:13:43	Raven67854	EddDeDuck, Generally speaking you really can't outdo the compiler. And even if you can it'd be marginal and not worth the huge time sink
2016-03-05 00:14:01	EddDeDuck	In standard use cases yes
2016-03-05 00:14:25	EddDeDuck	however you’d be suprised the amount of times we found compilers doing stupid things
2016-03-05 00:14:31	Raven67854	I'm annoyed at GCC
2016-03-05 00:14:56	EddDeDuck	anyway I need some lunch
2016-03-05 00:14:58	EddDeDuck	ttyl
2016-03-05 00:15:07	mirv_	GCC doesn't optimise msp430 properly
2016-03-05 00:15:08	mirv_	catchya
2016-03-05 00:15:21	Raven67854	the newer versions of gcc seem rushed
2016-03-05 00:15:26	Raven67854	And the code output isn't stellar sometimes

2016-03-05 00:16:22	TomJepp	I've started compiling a lot of personal projects with clang
2016-03-05 00:17:04	Raven67854	I use clang for local testing and gcc for final builds
2016-03-05 00:17:09	Raven67854	Might end up switching to pure clang
2016-03-05 00:19:13	Raven67854	mirv_, by the way vulkan is really nice haha.. The drivers still need a bit of work
2016-03-05 00:19:22	Raven67854	Still no debugger though. I have no idea where the debugger is
2016-03-05 00:20:06	mirv_	damn it, I want to start playing with vulkan
2016-03-05 00:20:23	mirv_	thinking of using the gf's laptop to do that (she has a carrizo)
2016-03-05 00:20:36	Raven67854	Why so you can code thousands of lines to draw a textured cube?

2016-03-05 00:21:05	Raven67854	I have my own little common code library. Already 25k lines large
2016-03-05 00:21:18	Raven67854	Well roughly 25k give or take a few hundred
2016-03-05 00:21:41	mirv_	vulkan is definitely going to take extra effort to write for, but that will be worth it I think
2016-03-05 00:21:49	Raven67854	Oh yeah
2016-03-05 00:22:01	Raven67854	The latest Nvidia vulkan drivers gave my app a huge bump in performance
2016-03-05 00:22:05	Raven67854	Just with the new drivers :P
2016-03-05 00:22:51	Raven67854	mirv_, It's kinda weird developing on a desktop machine and being able to actually use all the cores
2016-03-05 00:22:57	mirv_	makes me wonder what they're changing under the hood to get that improvement
2016-03-05 00:23:22	Raven67854	mirv_, Yeah me to =/. Because it's not much they can do. But then again it's beta drivers

2016-03-05 00:23:52	mirv_	they might have debugging & error checking already built in, and are slowly removing it
2016-03-05 00:23:58	Raven67854	Probably
2016-03-05 00:24:18	Raven67854	mirv_, I dunno if I said this. But Vulkan has ways to get the physical display <3

2016-03-05 00:26:58	Raven67854	The intel drivers work better than you'd expect them too as well mirv_
2016-03-05 00:27:26	mirv_	I suspect that's Valve's doing
2016-03-05 00:27:36	mirv_	or LunarG, whichever was the one helping out there
2016-03-05 00:27:39	Raven67854	Valve/Intel/LunarG
2016-03-05 00:27:43	Raven67854	All of them
2016-03-05 00:28:20	mirv_	Intel definitely have an interest in Vulkan, it should let them compete a bit better with at least light to mid-range gaming
2016-03-05 00:29:09	Raven67854	I can finally make full use of my beast of a processor

2016-03-05 01:22:11	millan	but I doubt the difference would cause serious incompatibilities, I mean, it's worth a try before attempting something more drastic, but I am not sure HOW to try
2016-03-05 01:22:42	millan	right
2016-03-05 01:22:46	millan	what I mean for now is
2016-03-05 01:22:47	frankyboy_	millan, download deb package?
2016-03-05 01:23:07	millan	... I guess at this point it might be the suremost shot

2016-03-05 01:27:38	millan	ugh, I heard bad things about stuff off Sourceforge
2016-03-05 01:27:50	millan	and they don't seem to host the .debs elsewhere
2016-03-05 01:28:23	Smilex	millan: sourcforge incjected malware into their downloads at some point
2016-03-05 01:28:39	millan	that's exactly what I mean haha
2016-03-05 01:28:41	stqn	more adware than malware, I think

2016-03-05 01:30:04	stqn	Smilex: and he fights it by repeatedly saying "PC" to mean "Windows" and not a word about Linux…
2016-03-05 01:30:39	EddDeDuck	 optional feature called DevShare, which places closed-source ad-supported content into the binary installers and gives the project part of the ad revenue.
2016-03-05 01:30:46	stqn	sorry, there is one word about linux :)

2016-03-05 01:31:12	tadzik	it'd be kind of hypocritical for Epic to show Linux as an alternative when they disregard it so heavily
2016-03-05 01:31:12	EddDeDuck	It was more a bunch of OpenSOurce advocates giving SourceForge a kicking for trying to gain some revenue for a service which was freely hosted

2016-03-05 01:32:03	stqn	Or being asked.
2016-03-05 01:32:05	Smilex	I guess I should have said, you can't spell bad without ad
2016-03-05 01:32:20	millan	For many people, when somebody says "Linux", it means they are a demon possessed by Stallman himself. I am honestly really glad somebody is writing articles about this without mentioning Linux, because this is bigger than the OS debate
2016-03-05 01:32:24	Smilex	EddDeDuck: No. I'm advocating for money transactions
2016-03-05 01:32:33	tadzik	millan (IRC): totally agreed
2016-03-05 01:33:00	tadzik	especially since bringing up steamos is like saying "it's okay if valve does that though"
2016-03-05 01:33:24	EddDeDuck	Valve / Gabe bias among Linux grown is strong

2016-03-05 01:33:38	EddDeDuck	They do get more of a free pass
2016-03-05 01:33:47	EddDeDuck	They do awesome stuff for sure :)
2016-03-05 01:34:12	Smilex	Valve seems to be losing much of their talent. I wonder if it's because they aren't satisfying the creatives with new projects
2016-03-05 01:34:20	millan	SteamOS is nothing like windows with a store since SteamOS base is open source and you are free to operate the store outside of SteamOS and vice versa, you can and always will be allowed to fiddle with your SteamOS software to your liking
2016-03-05 01:34:28	EddDeDuck	But Nvidia suck I will only use OpenSOurce drivers on my AMD card when playing on Steam [propriitary softwrae]

2016-03-05 01:34:58	tadzik	hahahah
2016-03-05 01:34:59	EddDeDuck	millan that’s not quite true
2016-03-05 01:35:08	tadzik	but EddDeDuck, it's different, it's not in the kernel!!!11
2016-03-05 01:35:33	EddDeDuck	That is one of the memes people try and use
2016-03-05 01:36:30	EddDeDuck	However if you are 100% behind open only for everytihng then no steam, no Intel CPUs, no Nvidia or AMD graphics wheer do you stop?

2016-03-05 01:38:56	EddDeDuck	@smilex that is a good way of looking at it
2016-03-05 01:39:34	EddDeDuck	Like supporting GoG I have a few guesses about GoG support (these are just my personal guesses based on experience)
2016-03-05 01:40:02	EddDeDuck	But I’m pretty sure the pickup on Linux will be lower due to a few factors.
2016-03-05 01:40:33	tadzik	linux users don't forgive easily, and gog is already "a bad guy" in many ways
2016-03-05 01:40:47	EddDeDuck	Linux is already a tiny market so you need to make sure you do all you can to make your titles profitable so you can keep on porting. Steam is the biggest player by a large margin.
2016-03-05 01:41:06	EddDeDuck	This means GoG is a small market of a smaller market so you need to look at cost / benefit
2016-03-05 01:41:11	Raven67854	tadzik, Forgiving easily/often is how you end up with Windows

2016-03-05 01:41:55	EddDeDuck	Given most games use Steam intergration for leaderbopards, friends mutlipletrr, achievements etc there are large part of the game you need to remove/tweak and/or reimpiment.
2016-03-05 01:41:57	tadzik	I disagree
2016-03-05 01:42:19	homerj	give me a year, I'll be able to tell you business cases for going to GoG
2016-03-05 01:42:20	tadzik	someone Good would have to come up with an API that has a backend in gog, steam etc
2016-03-05 01:42:30	tadzik	someone Good, like Val... ee, no
2016-03-05 01:42:34	Smilex	I dislike games that rely entierly on Steam for major features like multiplayer
2016-03-05 01:42:36	EddDeDuck	That’s before any licensing / DRM etc quetsions come up. The pure practical aspect is tricky
2016-03-05 01:42:53	Smilex	I meant, I dislike that games do that. The game can still be good
2016-03-05 01:42:58	EddDeDuck	Smilex, when you start making games it’s prety different
2016-03-05 01:43:11	homerj	well, it depends for multiplayer
2016-03-05 01:43:24	homerj	I don't really like making another account somewhere just for multiplayer
2016-03-05 01:43:51	EddDeDuck	“So we have a bullet proof well designed and scaling system that works and is maintained for free or we can try and design our own to do the same thing and then pay our programmers and testers to maintain it?”
2016-03-05 01:43:52	Smilex	homerj: No I mean neglecting things like LAN
2016-03-05 01:44:03	homerj	I don't even know how many people play on LAN anymore
2016-03-05 01:44:11	Smilex	me!
2016-03-05 01:44:24	homerj	I think LAN falls under "X11 network transparency"
2016-03-05 01:44:29	EddDeDuck	Few companies will say hell yeah lets pay an extra $200,000 plus ongoing maintaince instead of this system we could just drop in
2016-03-05 01:44:31	homerj	something everyone thinks they want, but no one really uses
2016-03-05 01:44:52	EddDeDuck	LAN usage based on actual stats I have seen has died a death
2016-03-05 01:45:14	EddDeDuck	LAN support is great
2016-03-05 01:45:17	Smilex	EddDeDuck: But you can pay for an abstraction layer that allows any other 3rd party to pay for their implementation of it
2016-03-05 01:45:24	stqn	Smilex: the problem with multiplayer is if you don’t rely on Steam, you have to make your own multiplayer infrastructure, rent servers, write all the code… and then people will complain they can’t play with their friends on Steam
2016-03-05 01:45:28	Smilex	that's how the industry grows as a 'organism'
2016-03-05 01:45:42	Raven67854	stqn, All steam offers is a way to connect players together
2016-03-05 01:45:42	EddDeDuck	Smilex that is impossible to impiment
2016-03-05 01:45:45	Raven67854	They don't offer servers
2016-03-05 01:46:02	EddDeDuck	Well perhaps not impiment but impossible to get everyone to use it
2016-03-05 01:46:05	Smilex	EddDeDuck: It's not. OpenGL is that.
2016-03-05 01:46:07	Raven67854	They do offer matchmaking support. But you still need all of the servers
2016-03-05 01:46:31	stqn	Raven67854: ok, well, unless it’s P2P
2016-03-05 01:46:31	EddDeDuck	I must hav emissed all that OpenGL hardware servers rendering for you all overt theglobe :)
2016-03-05 01:46:35	EddDeDuck	OH wait…:p
2016-03-05 01:46:51	homerj	well, I go now, have to pick up a letter of recommendation, and see if they still want me to adjunct
2016-03-05 01:47:08	Smilex	EddDeDuck: No I mean it still does what steam integration does, but it allows another 3rd party to implement the same features, and add their support.
2016-03-05 01:47:19	EddDeDuck	that already exists
2016-03-05 01:47:24	EddDeDuck	to a degree
2016-03-05 01:47:32	EddDeDuck	all these systems are pretty much the same on the back end
2016-03-05 01:47:33	*	homerj maybe teaching an OpenGL class
2016-03-05 01:47:33	homerj	heh
2016-03-05 01:47:34	Smilex	hopefully the abstraction then supports messaging between different implementations, and you have multiplayer across systems
2016-03-05 01:47:34	openfbtd	Multiplayer, in my mind, HAVE to have a way to connect directly
2016-03-05 01:47:42	openfbtd	Or dedicated server software
2016-03-05 01:47:48	Raven67854	Smilex, 3rd parties can use Steams api
2016-03-05 01:47:53	Raven67854	GoG galaxy does this
2016-03-05 01:47:57	openfbtd	Multiplayer games*
2016-03-05 01:48:04	EddDeDuck	You can use PART of Steams API
2016-03-05 01:48:16	openfbtd	Unless they are f2p
2016-03-05 01:48:22	openfbtd	That's a different story
2016-03-05 01:48:33	Smilex	Raven67854: Oh didn't know that. Thought developers were locking into Steam
2016-03-05 01:48:44	Raven67854	Most devs don't lock into Steam
2016-03-05 01:49:07	Raven67854	Valve doesn't even force you to use all of that stuff.. Entirely up to you
2016-03-05 01:49:36	Smilex	Raven67854: I thought that their stuff only works with their service
2016-03-05 01:50:01	Raven67854	As a developer your job is to do whatever is best for your game
2016-03-05 01:50:03	EddDeDuck	There is no lockin apart from ease of use
2016-03-05 01:50:14	Raven67854	Steam is a pretty good choice for that
2016-03-05 01:51:03	winter	yeah, Steam even allows DRM-free stuff
2016-03-05 01:51:17	winter	so for some stuff you don't even have to necessarily be running steam
2016-03-05 01:51:48	EddDeDuck	Yeah that’s true
2016-03-05 01:51:54	Raven67854	Steam-DRM doesn't work on Linux anyhow still
2016-03-05 01:52:01	EddDeDuck	or Mac
2016-03-05 01:52:12	EddDeDuck	and they have discontinued it on WIndows (no further deveopment)
2016-03-05 01:52:24	tadzik	oh
2016-03-05 01:52:42	EddDeDuck	Windows DRM stuff has not been updated in years and years now
2016-03-05 01:52:52	EddDeDuck	want DRM bring your own
2016-03-05 01:53:09	EddDeDuck	Appears to the suggetsion
2016-03-05 01:53:26	Raven67854	How it should be
2016-03-05 01:53:51	tadzik	it might've been steam's selling points in the early days
2016-03-05 01:53:56	tadzik	"sell here, get drm for free"
2016-03-05 01:54:15	tadzik	now everyone wants to be on steam anyway
2016-03-05 01:54:27	EddDeDuck	It depends
2016-03-05 01:54:33	EddDeDuck	what you call DRM :)
2016-03-05 01:54:42	tadzik	troo
2016-03-05 01:54:46	EddDeDuck	Steam have what I think is smart DRM
2016-03-05 01:55:08	EddDeDuck	Use your online systems to provide features for your users that only legitimate peopel have access too.
2016-03-05 01:55:10	tadzik	my first experience with steam is that suddenly all the pirate games started having "NO STEAM" in names
2016-03-05 01:55:22	tadzik	yeah, that's exactly what sold me

2016-03-05 01:56:28	stqn	what sold me to buying games is having money
2016-03-05 01:56:36	tadzik	that too :)
2016-03-05 01:56:44	Raven67854	What's the matter? You don't like Starforce, securom or tages? :D
2016-03-05 01:56:54	Raven67854	You don't like your games not booting because you have a 2nd or virtual drive :D
2016-03-05 01:56:58	Raven67854	How dare you tadzik!
2016-03-05 01:57:32	homerj	starforce killed a cdr of mine
2016-03-05 01:57:33	tadzik	that was never really an issue for me, honestly
2016-03-05 01:57:49	tadzik	mostly because I didn't really buy games until like 3 years ago
2016-03-05 01:57:54	EddDeDuck	Using that reasoning is like saying I don’t use Linux because Mint is insecure and Fedora is a pain to get working. :)
2016-03-05 01:58:01	tadzik	pirating has been The Way to get games here for as long as I remember
2016-03-05 01:58:11	tadzik	I have some funny stories about that :)
2016-03-05 01:58:43	EddDeDuck	There is loads of bad DRM but that does not negate the fact that to a degree some form of piracy prevention is needed so people can cloth themselves and earn money

2016-03-05 02:00:04	Piratelv	doesn't that denuvo thing kill ssd's by continually writing to them?
2016-03-05 02:00:04	stqn	sigh…
2016-03-05 02:00:11	EddDeDuck	nope
2016-03-05 02:00:13	psymin	EddDeDuck: zero bad effects?  Incorrect.  It sometimes causes issues with wine
2016-03-05 02:00:15	EddDeDuck	That was fudd
2016-03-05 02:00:28	tadzik	almost everything about SSDs is fud :P
2016-03-05 02:00:31	EddDeDuck	no issues on SSDs

2016-03-05 02:00:53	Piratelv	okay, sounded fishy when I heard about it but never looked further into it

2016-03-05 03:30:53	EddDeDuck	“People, especially game devs, seem pretty dismissive of Vulkan. While it is not yet time to ring the bells and sound the alarm I did find it mildly concerning. Granted only a few people replied to my question.” -> Seems some people are waking up to the fact Vulkan isn’t going to be a DX12 beater any time soon
2016-03-05 03:31:10	EddDeDuck	It’s unlikely to be an OpenGL beater for many in the short term
2016-03-05 03:31:46	EddDeDuck	Vulkan is defintely come back in 12 months ebfore you can see how well it’s doing
2016-03-05 03:33:46	PaulDana	i have had this same convo with many devs. 12 months seem the *minimum* before we try to measure its success / impact
2016-03-05 03:34:01	EddDeDuck	Yeah
2016-03-05 03:34:20	EddDeDuck	Usually takes 2 to 3 years before a new API is fuly used

2016-03-05 03:46:13	frankyboy_	ahh.. i see. ty
2016-03-05 03:46:17	EddDeDuck	frankyboy yes plus the time it takes from API released to API is usable
2016-03-05 03:46:43	EddDeDuck	For example right now Vulkan is released but if you wanted to make any money you could not release anything using Vulkan
2016-03-05 03:47:14	EddDeDuck	The drivers are beta, instaled on a tiny number of machiens (and none by default) and AMD are missing driver support.
2016-03-05 03:47:14	anonkun	I love how shadow of mordor was released on every concievable platform that has some users
2016-03-05 03:47:43	EddDeDuck	nothing that special about mordor on that regard
2016-03-05 03:47:51	anonkun	how so
2016-03-05 03:48:00	EddDeDuck	It did have a legacy 360 version but that’s more due to it’s age
2016-03-05 03:48:01	anonkun	what other games do that
2016-03-05 03:48:07	anonkun	well yeah

2016-03-05 03:49:05	EddDeDuck	yep
2016-03-05 03:49:24	anonkun	I was gonna buy it but it seemed the gameplay was boring
2016-03-05 03:49:38	anonkun	Any chance, even remotely, that the next mass effect wil work on gnu/linux?
2016-03-05 03:49:47	anonkun	or as valve labels it, steamos + linux :P
2016-03-05 03:50:08	anonkun	I mean its under EA if i'm correct
2016-03-05 03:50:18	EddDeDuck	Given it is owned by Microsoft so is usualy a MS platform exclusive at least to start with + no other game in the series was released on Mac/Linux I’d say highly unlikely

2016-03-05 03:50:41	anonkun	well, steam OS was released after the final mass effect thing
2016-03-05 03:50:54	anonkun	but I didn't know MS owned it
2016-03-05 03:51:01	EddDeDuck	Well it’s EA now
2016-03-05 03:51:04	EddDeDuck	It’s passed over
2016-03-05 03:51:06	EddDeDuck	it seems
2016-03-05 03:51:22	anonkun	made by bioware owned by EA
2016-03-05 03:51:23	EddDeDuck	either way I’d say unliekly and Valve having a Linux OS and calling it SteamOS is unliely to chnage that
2016-03-05 03:51:45	anonkun	Well, that's one of the reasons why Linux started getting so many games
2016-03-05 03:51:53	@Samsai	worth remembering that valve and EA are in competition when it comes to games distribution
2016-03-05 03:52:12	EddDeDuck	Mac is bigger than Linux by some margin and SteamOS is a tiny portion of Linux userbase so it’s just too tiny to make a strong case for EA to do the game themseleves.
2016-03-05 03:52:20	@Samsai	and steamos is basically the linux distro publishers will target
2016-03-05 03:52:27	anonkun	right
2016-03-05 03:52:35	anonkun	and even if they did, it would contain that horrible origin
2016-03-05 03:52:35	EddDeDuck	Also EA and Valve don’t get on
2016-03-05 03:52:43	anonkun	I regret
2016-03-05 03:52:44	EddDeDuck	So could not be on Steam
2016-03-05 03:52:50	anonkun	purchasing battlefront, star wars.

2016-03-05 03:56:03	EddDeDuck	I have too many games I need to play right now

2016-03-05 03:56:47	@Samsai	luckily my lists are based on the recent games and trends so i don't have too much to choose from
2016-03-05 03:57:10	@Samsai	soul axiom and factorio are probably the biggest things to cover now
2016-03-05 03:57:41	@Samsai	my laziness is simply having an issue with soul axiom

2016-03-05 04:23:23	@Samsai	games work just fine but OBS never seems to finds the .so file and starts complaining
2016-03-05 04:24:07	DrMcCoy	i really which that bad, insufficient stb "license" wouldn't spread
2016-03-05 04:24:28	DrMcCoy	CC0 exists for a reason
2016-03-05 04:24:46	Smilex	DrMcCoy: it attempts to be public domain. What's the problem with that?
2016-03-05 04:25:08	DrMcCoy	"public domain" doesn't work that way
2016-03-05 04:25:42	Smilex	In some countries it does. If it doesn't, the fallback is something similar to MIT
2016-03-05 04:25:45	DrMcCoy	In most jurisdictions that have a public domain (which is far from all), you can't explictly put something into the public domain. They fall into public domain automatically
2016-03-05 04:25:57	DrMcCoy	That's why the CC0 has this huge-ass fallback clause
2016-03-05 04:26:11	DrMcCoy	Actually created and checked by copyright lawyers
2016-03-05 04:26:28	DrMcCoy	And not this crayon-license that stb has
2016-03-05 04:26:56	Smilex	but the STB license has the backing of superb libraries which push it forward
2016-03-05 04:27:05	Smilex	You could contact Sean Barett about this
2016-03-05 04:27:09	Smilex	@nothings on twitter
2016-03-05 04:27:14	DrMcCoy	He knows about this
2016-03-05 04:27:17	DrMcCoy	He doesn't care
2016-03-05 04:27:20	DrMcCoy	That's the problem
2016-03-05 04:30:01	DrMcCoy	Most crucially, the stb license is missing a warranty disclaimer. Some jurisdictions have implied warranties
2016-03-05 04:30:24	linux_gamer	anyone tried vulkansdk-linux-x86_64-1.0.3.1.run?
2016-03-05 04:30:28	DrMcCoy	That's why you see that "AS IS" boilerplate so often
2016-03-05 04:31:47	Smilex	DrMcCoy: I think I heard him mention once something about if it's even an issue if you don't protect yourself or something
2016-03-05 04:32:21	DrMcCoy	I mean, I like the idea of the stb libraries. And that network wrapper looks quite useful; might be something I could need for xoreos in the future. I'm just not comfortable with that license
2016-03-05 04:32:39	Smilex	DrMcCoy: Relicense it?
2016-03-05 04:33:07	linux_gamer	anyone creted a lunarg account?
2016-03-05 04:33:30	linux_gamer	LunarXchange account to be correct
2016-03-05 04:33:37	Smilex	linux_gamer: first thing I did was figure out how to avoid that
2016-03-05 04:33:40	DrMcCoy	Smilex: Realistically, should I include it in xoreos, it would become GPLv3 anyway, yes
2016-03-05 04:33:48	linux_gamer	Smilex, and...
2016-03-05 04:34:05	linux_gamer	i installed the sdk, but cant find a binary
2016-03-05 04:34:11	@Samsai	well, shit
2016-03-05 04:34:21	Smilex	linux_gamer: binary for what?
2016-03-05 04:34:30	Smilex	DrMcCoy: I don't see the issue then
2016-03-05 04:34:40	@Samsai	i installed the blob just to get soul axiom running and it still has render errors
2016-03-05 04:35:58	linux_gamer	Smilex, isn't there any binary included?
2016-03-05 04:36:08	DrMcCoy	Well, the warranty thing would become an issue for contributors of the stb libraries, not for me
2016-03-05 04:36:14	Smilex	linux_gamer: there is one for compiling GLSL to SPIR-v

2016-03-05 04:36:43	DrMcCoy	For me, the problem might be an stb contributor arguing that the license was invalid, and my inclusion of it in xoreos was a copyright violation
2016-03-05 04:36:50	DrMcCoy	(two separate issues, there)
2016-03-05 04:37:13	DrMcCoy	I don't view any of these likely to happen, mind
2016-03-05 04:37:29	Smilex	that's just going to be ugly. No one's taking you to court
2016-03-05 04:38:13	DrMcCoy	Still, I'd feel better with a more explicit license. Sean Barrett obviously disagrees there
2016-03-05 04:40:18	linux_gamer	Smilex, did you do the registration?
2016-03-05 04:40:35	Smilex	linux_gamer: no. didn't need it

2016-03-05 06:13:40	No1RL355	nothing to be sad about - Im had toxikk
2016-03-05 06:13:43	No1RL355	dead game
2016-03-05 06:13:46	No1RL355	none plays it
2016-03-05 06:13:50	stqn	I should sell all my cards now
2016-03-05 06:14:09	No1RL355	yep, it has pretty graphics (like witcher3, or so), but its empty
2016-03-05 06:14:23	openfbtd	No1RL355, people don't play arena shooters anymore
2016-03-05 06:14:25	openfbtd	That's sad
2016-03-05 06:14:43	openfbtd	Is it good gameplay-wise btw?
2016-03-05 06:15:00	openfbtd	Because if it was, I'd buy it just to play with friebds
2016-03-05 06:15:03	openfbtd	friends*
2016-03-05 06:15:09	openfbtd	And if it was on linux
2016-03-05 06:15:20	openfbtd	As it stands, I play Xonotic relatively often
2016-03-05 06:15:32	openfbtd	It doesn't have a big community either
2016-03-05 06:15:34	No1RL355	for me - there was problem with camera.
2016-03-05 06:15:48	No1RL355	its too close to character

2016-03-05 06:16:18	No1RL355	you must try it
2016-03-05 06:16:27	No1RL355	then you will find, what Im told about
2016-03-05 06:17:09	No1RL355	its like camera isnt near character's eyes
2016-03-05 06:18:23	No1RL355	btw - yep, it has pretty cool graphics and its f*ckin awesome to ride on venicles on maps, where them are avalaible (was only on snow one, when Im tried this game last time)
2016-03-05 06:18:53	No1RL355	but none plays and problems with camera. Thats why its failed
2016-03-05 06:18:59	No1RL355	also zero pr
2016-03-05 06:19:13	No1RL355	strife may blast, cuz its devolver game
2016-03-05 06:19:15	openfbtd	Arena shooter is dead
2016-03-05 06:19:25	openfbtd	It's a completely dead genre no one wants
2016-03-05 06:19:27	No1RL355	so - there will be pr and others
2016-03-05 06:19:31	No1RL355	it isnt
2016-03-05 06:19:42	openfbtd	STRIFE will work because it has singleplayer

2016-03-05 06:20:38	openfbtd	Toxikk looks like it's 99 again, and so does NExuiz (the windows flashy one)

2016-03-05 06:22:53	frostwork	openfbtd, I really fail in fps, wasn't my genre when I was young I guess :}
2016-03-05 06:23:11	openfbtd	Eh, I'm not that good at arena shooters either
2016-03-05 06:23:31	frostwork	amiga->morphos->linux skipped the fps golden days more or less
2016-03-05 06:23:39	No1RL355	you basically could do almost everything. Walljumps, animation cancells to increase reloading speed, tricks to jump through lasers without death
2016-03-05 06:23:52	openfbtd	But fuck if it's not fun to do a double laser jump, switch to quicksilver and frag some fucker from above

2016-03-05 06:31:00	openfbtd	I always found it silly that jumping required careful timing in such a fast game
2016-03-05 06:31:07	AciD`	a teammate in our q3cpm team made was one of the founder of warsow
2016-03-05 06:31:12	AciD`	you can imagine the roots ;)
2016-03-05 06:31:19	AciD`	-made
2016-03-05 06:31:22	openfbtd	Xonotic solves it by actually giving you bunnyhop with pressed down jump button
2016-03-05 06:31:30	No1RL355	warsow strongly needs artist btw
2016-03-05 06:31:46	openfbtd	It requires less concentration but still asks for skill, as x-bunnyhop is still a thing
2016-03-05 06:31:59	openfbtd	And, you know, running into walls
2016-03-05 06:32:06	openfbtd	Xonotic also gives you laser jumps
2016-03-05 06:32:18	No1RL355	guys
2016-03-05 06:32:24	AciD`	well, if you have difficulties bunny hoping q1 style, q3 cpm offers you 2 ways to do it, the old q2 one, and the hold uparrow only and just jump and mouse the mouse
2016-03-05 06:32:25	AciD`	:)
2016-03-05 06:32:34	No1RL355	is someone know, will there be xfce alternatives with wayland support?

2016-03-05 06:32:53	openfbtd	Which are like rocketjumps, but eat less hp

2016-03-05 06:37:54	No1RL355	not in quests, but in classes. Theoretically its classless, but... You cant make paladin, cuz shield requires str. You cant make mage archer for same thing. Vampiric requires int. Every whole skill, except warrior/archer/assassin ones, requires int
2016-03-05 06:38:18	No1RL355	that... I believe, divinity 2 will be better
2016-03-05 06:38:56	No1RL355	its cool to play with dual-wand mage, but, when you cant make your own class in game with classless system - thats awfull
2016-03-05 06:39:52	No1RL355	ever torchlight had alternatives. You could always make mage with shield, cuz not all shield required str + they was unlockable not only by stats, but by lvl too

2016-03-05 13:16:05	dabblers-buffet	Hey guys.
2016-03-05 13:18:22	dabblers-buffet	I wonder, is it ok to store CDs in paper sleeves? Or will they scratch the data surface of the disc?
2016-03-05 13:20:28	Raven67854	People still use cd's?
2016-03-05 13:24:11	dabblers-buffet	I asked a question, I didn't say anything about that.
2016-03-05 13:24:20	dabblers-buffet	& yeah, some people do.
2016-03-05 13:24:26	dabblers-buffet	But it's rare though in today's tech world.
2016-03-05 13:24:46	dabblers-buffet	I'm glad I didn't install an optical drive, I saved money on my PC build.
2016-03-05 13:27:27	dabblers-buffet	I have a bunch of old CDs, computer software related ones.
2016-03-05 13:29:06	dabblers-buffet	But I'd like some alternatives than just storing them in their regular cases.
2016-03-05 13:29:19	dabblers-buffet	To save space & make them compact.
2016-03-05 13:29:32	dabblers-buffet	Paper sleeves seem to be the most space saving option.
2016-03-05 13:35:55	kkit	it shouldn't scratch much if you aren't moving the box full of cds around much
2016-03-05 13:36:05	kkit	and you're not in a dusty environment
2016-03-05 13:38:58	dabblers-buffet	Yeah, I don't move the box around that much.
2016-03-05 13:40:57	dabblers-buffet	I only store it in a dark area in my closet.
2016-03-05 13:41:02	dabblers-buffet	I rarely bring out the box.
2016-03-05 13:41:06	dabblers-buffet	I think I'm fine.

2016-03-05 13:44:16	dabblers-buffet	To be a little safer, I could store them in jewel cases.
2016-03-05 13:45:21	dabblers-buffet	They are slim too, & as well as when you put the disc in the case, it's settling on plastic.
2016-03-05 13:45:36	dabblers-buffet	The surface of it is.

2016-03-06 02:26:27	kkit	yeah but which line of dells?
2016-03-06 02:26:32	flurman	all of them
2016-03-06 02:26:46	sebbu2	MVS is a type of monitor like IPS
2016-03-06 02:26:54	hidekin	even the ultrasharp ?
2016-03-06 02:27:05	sebbu2	quite a few expensive samsung monitor has that type
2016-03-06 02:27:07	flurman	yep, all of them. the only difference is typically the dell's have better panels in
2016-03-06 02:27:27	flurman	but the control boards and power supplies are the same
2016-03-06 02:28:01	flurman	in case you are wondering how i know.. have re-capped many monitors :)
2016-03-06 02:28:09	hidekin	My u2410 is still so good , the colors accuracy is really awesome
2016-03-06 02:28:17	stqn	sebbu2: my web search engine doesn’t know anything about mvs monitors or panels…
2016-03-06 02:28:48	disharmonic	stqn: EIZO charges a premium, so 300€ really gets you a bad EIZO. Dell is or at least used to be the most reliable for consumer IPS displays.

2016-03-06 02:28:56	hidekin	isn't that VA screens and not mvs ?
2016-03-06 02:29:27	flurman	hazro are pretty good if you like IPS

2016-03-06 02:29:43	kkit	eventually
2016-03-06 02:29:47	stqn	and very expensive too
2016-03-06 02:30:08	disharmonic	flurman: BenQ isn't bad quality they just basically have no QC for their monitors, so it's a lottery.
2016-03-06 02:30:26	kkit	is their rma policy any good?
2016-03-06 02:30:28	flurman	disharmonic: cheap crappy capacitors is the usual cause.. or bad leadfree soldering
2016-03-06 02:30:47	hidekin	I'm interested in the acer IPS gaming monitor but seems their QA is really bad
2016-03-06 02:31:06	flurman	there's a line of benq/dells, cant remember the exact make now, but they all die of backlight failure because of shit soldering in the backlight inverter
2016-03-06 02:31:26	hidekin	I mean QC not QA

2016-03-06 02:34:48	disharmonic	BTW, IGZO is a variant of TN?
2016-03-06 02:34:51	stqn	next one I buy will be a 1440p VA if I can find a good one.
2016-03-06 02:35:16	xpander69	my IPS is 8ms afaik and my TN is 2ms.. its better to play Xonotic on TN ..but colors look awful :D
2016-03-06 02:35:39	mETz	mine says 5ms, pfft
2016-03-06 02:35:53	stqn	don’t trust the official numbers guys ;)
2016-03-06 02:35:57	disharmonic	Hopefully OLED will be mainstream in ~2 years
2016-03-06 02:36:09	mETz	I played Quake 3 on my first TFT and back then response time was rather > 30ms
2016-03-06 02:36:25	mETz	Sea sickness included after some time ;)

2016-03-06 02:37:26	flurman	i have an LG 22EA53T, discontinued now.. its IPS with white led backlight. looks lovely to me, and it has 5ms grey-grey refresh, never seen any ghosting on games or movies with it
2016-03-06 02:37:34	xpander69	ohh i see mine reports 5ms also ..but still i can see the difference when playing fast paced games... its much better on TN panel.. but yeah colors are shitty
2016-03-06 02:37:37	flurman	the only crap thing about it is it's stand, but it has a vesa mount

2016-03-06 05:43:31	tadzik	and the big ones? I fought one until two of my weapons broke, eventually I ran away, fuck that
2016-03-06 05:43:34	tadzik	and that's on normal

2016-03-06 05:44:57	openfbtd	I just avoid them at all costs

2016-03-06 05:56:54	@NaughtySquid	if anything big data is prone to more errors than small data due to the size

2016-03-06 12:22:59	stqn	the stealth part in 2033 was cool, the mini games not so much

2016-03-08 08:34:38	sziszi	are you f'n kiddin?
2016-03-08 08:34:42	@Samsai	alternatively drop the resolution until the picture doesn't have visible compression artifacts
2016-03-08 08:34:54	disharmonic	So, any of you know any OSS software that can do Variable Data Printing?
2016-03-08 08:35:15	Smilex	sziszi: I use livestreamer
2016-03-08 08:35:26	Smilex	has Twitch.tv got rid of the flashplayer requirement?
2016-03-08 08:35:48	sziszi	mostly
2016-03-08 08:35:48	josefnpat	use livestreamer :)

2016-03-08 08:36:06	@Samsai	Smilex, yes, but i also have my bitrate at 2000k

2016-03-08 08:36:20	Smilex	Samsai: and your up speed is?
2016-03-08 08:36:29	@Samsai	10 mbps on 4g
2016-03-08 08:36:40	stqn	twitch doesn't work without flash here
2016-03-08 08:36:41	Smilex	sziszi: Oh then I might use twitch.tv. Wanted to use hitbox.tv to support the underdog
2016-03-08 08:36:47	Smilex	Samsai: Oh.
2016-03-08 08:37:07	@Samsai	i play it safe because 4g isn't the most stable thing ever
2016-03-08 08:37:11	openfbtd	Smilex, really, if this is the only thing they did with the actual gameplay
2016-03-08 08:37:18	openfbtd	Yeah, I'd take a walking sim
2016-03-08 08:37:31	openfbtd	SOMA's monsters are literally Slender :(
2016-03-08 08:38:12	@Samsai	Smilex, keep in mind that the blurriness depends heavily on the stuff on the screen
2016-03-08 08:38:45	@Samsai	in this case you have factorio which has plenty of static content but also lots of small things moving on transport belts
2016-03-08 08:39:17	@Samsai	the more static things are the easier it compresses and you see less blurriness
2016-03-08 08:39:20	Smilex	Yeah. I should try code
2016-03-08 08:40:13	@Samsai	with code you should basically have no issues
2016-03-08 08:40:22	openfbtd	I got annoyed by SOMA and quit
2016-03-08 08:40:27	@Samsai	you could even push a higher resolution without increasing the bitrate significantly

2016-03-08 08:41:31	openfbtd	I would rather I had to shoot it
2016-03-08 08:41:39	openfbtd	It's not scary, it's just annoying
2016-03-08 08:44:31	Smilex	Samsai: If I use more CPU, does the compression get better?
2016-03-08 08:44:40	@Samsai	yes
2016-03-08 08:44:59	@Samsai	it uses a more aggressive compression and gets better results
2016-03-08 08:45:05	Smilex	sounds good for code stuff and indie games. What preset do you use?
2016-03-08 08:45:46	@Samsai	i have it on veryfast
2016-03-08 08:46:26	@Samsai	i think i've used faster in the past when bandwidth was an issue

2016-03-08 09:00:51	@Samsai	Smilex, just use the option in video
2016-03-08 09:00:56	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: do you just capture the screen?
2016-03-08 09:01:06	@Samsai	also allows you to mess with the downscale filter
2016-03-08 09:01:28	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, the window capture plugin has been broken on mesa for a while now
2016-03-08 09:01:43	@NaughtySquid	i see
2016-03-08 09:01:44	Smilex	Samsai: do you know anything about the filters? (Which ones are good when, etc.)
2016-03-08 09:01:47	@NaughtySquid	seems it's broken in general
2016-03-08 09:01:57	@NaughtySquid	annoying, i hate sharing a whole screen
2016-03-08 09:02:05	@Samsai	Smilex, if you have the processing power just go for the best one
2016-03-08 09:02:15	@Samsai	i had some issues with lanczos so i just use bicubic
2016-03-08 09:03:07	Smilex	Anyone know if it's best that the source video is the largest possible resolution for scaling algorithms?
2016-03-08 09:03:28	@Samsai	in the optimal scenario you want to downscale as little as you can
2016-03-08 09:03:37	@Samsai	because downscale filters are not perfect
2016-03-08 09:03:43	Smilex	ok so the opposite is true. Makes sense
2016-03-08 09:04:03	Smilex	So optimally I'd play with the source resolution

2016-03-08 09:18:53	@Samsai	seriously, liam is a computer problem magnet
2016-03-08 09:19:17	FutureSuture	He's probably being punished for getting Windows 10.

2016-03-08 11:01:10	@NaughtySquid	Piratelv: how do i link my git to that git?
2016-03-08 11:01:15	@NaughtySquid	im reading a beginners guide
2016-03-08 11:01:30	@NaughtySquid	and it's completely missed out on how you link your existing stuff to a host like github or gitlab
2016-03-08 11:01:51	Piratelv	with link you mean upload / download?
2016-03-08 11:02:25	@NaughtySquid	yeah
2016-03-08 11:02:31	@NaughtySquid	git remote add origin <link> is it?
2016-03-08 11:03:10	@NaughtySquid	ah seems it is
2016-03-08 11:03:16	Piratelv	Yes, that is how you add a remote repository (origin is a name in this command, can be anything but origin is the default)
2016-03-08 11:03:40	Piratelv	With git the entire repository is uasally downloaded to your pc when you `git clone` it
2016-03-08 11:04:07	No1RL355	just use 'git gud'

2016-03-08 11:11:29	Piratelv	Yes it is, It is possible to save them. But that is a highly not recommended to do (as they would be stored in plain text)
2016-03-08 11:12:19	@NaughtySquid	Piratelv: added you as a Master
2016-03-08 11:12:21	@NaughtySquid	sounds fancy
2016-03-08 11:12:30	@NaughtySquid	also done the initial commit of all files
2016-03-08 11:12:44	@NaughtySquid	dont think it matters having my config there, as it's my localhost password
2016-03-08 11:13:00	@NaughtySquid	might tell git to ignore it and remove it tho, not sure

2016-03-08 11:16:55	Piratelv	I would say keep the config. Makes it easier to get started

2016-03-09 08:27:09	salamanderrake	why is it in Start Drive II when you do a screen shot it ends the game?
2016-03-09 08:27:21	Alwaysgeeky	thaanks Piratelv
2016-03-09 08:40:57	Alwaysgeeky	Piratelv - I updated the cmake and make files, could you try compiling again?
2016-03-09 08:44:28	@NaughtySquid	from master of orion devs
2016-03-09 08:44:29	@NaughtySquid	"@LiamD: It's unlikely that Linux/SteamOS will be ready for EA 2, but we will do our best to get it done as soon as possible."
2016-03-09 08:44:47	@NaughtySquid	so an early access release for the new MOO is likely then

2016-03-09 08:52:12	Piratelv	Alwaysgeeky, Builds without errors now, but the binary doesn't run correctly
2016-03-09 08:53:51	@NaughtySquid	im off until tomorrow morn

2016-03-09 09:00:17	Piratelv	Alwaysgeeky, Got it working, had to run it from a different directory. Apparently it SIGSEGVs when it can't find  'media/config/settings.ini'
2016-03-09 09:00:44	Alwaysgeeky	ah yes... the working directory needs to be the root
2016-03-09 09:00:57	Alwaysgeeky	but it compiled and linked ok with my cmake changes?
2016-03-09 09:01:07	Piratelv	yes
2016-03-09 09:01:22	Alwaysgeeky	the cmake file didnt have the correct casing for 'Pages' thats why it couldn't link properly...
2016-03-09 09:02:54	Piratelv	ah yeah that would make it fail
2016-03-09 09:03:46	Piratelv	Also it seems up and down with my mouse seem inverted. Is that intentional / test-config?
2016-03-09 09:04:34	Alwaysgeeky	it isn't intentional, but I will add the invert toggle to the options config soon
2016-03-09 09:04:37	Alwaysgeeky	thanks for your testing
2016-03-09 09:08:30	Piratelv	Okay Though as much.  One last tip, don't run this at 2560x1440 res unless you have a powerfull pc haha
2016-03-09 09:09:04	Alwaysgeeky	lol

2016-03-09 23:58:25	Kallestofeles	Yeah, NaughtySquid, stream arma3 update with Ysblokje!
2016-03-09 23:58:33	Kallestofeles	I'm bored to hell @work.
2016-03-09 23:58:35	Kallestofeles	:D

2016-03-09 23:58:49	@NaughtySquid	is it out?
2016-03-09 23:58:51	Ysblokje	yeah
2016-03-09 23:58:52	@NaughtySquid	i dont see a dl yet
2016-03-09 23:58:56	tumocs	downloading atm
2016-03-09 23:58:58	Ysblokje	We do :D
2016-03-09 23:59:06	@NaughtySquid	now i do
2016-03-09 23:59:23	openfbtd	Heh. Day-Z is for ArmA II, right?
2016-03-09 23:59:48	tumocs	I think so
2016-03-09 23:59:56	openfbtd	Yeah it is
2016-03-10 00:00:00	tumocs	never played it or interested of it
2016-03-10 00:00:17	Cracker	I'm confused why with a game like arma 3 they used VP
2016-03-10 00:00:36	Ysblokje	Not enough resources to port the engine
2016-03-10 00:00:37	Cracker	don't get me wrong, I don't have an issue with VP, but Arma 3 is ever evolving, this meaning our ports will be ever behind
2016-03-10 00:00:42	Ysblokje	its heavily DX based
2016-03-10 00:00:45	Cracker	yes, their are other porters out there ;)
2016-03-10 00:00:59	EddDeDuck	Constantly updated games are painful even in house to be fair
2016-03-10 00:01:05	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-03-10 00:01:11	Cracker	porting is painful
2016-03-10 00:01:14	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-03-10 00:01:16	Cracker	I know this
2016-03-10 00:01:23	openfbtd	Wait. Can volatiles swim
2016-03-10 00:01:44	openfbtd	Oh. They can't
2016-03-10 00:01:57	Cracker	I just don't know why they are releasing older releases of a game, why  is this the progression of the ports?
2016-03-10 00:02:04	openfbtd	There is a volatile nest in The Following. Its entrance is underwater
2016-03-10 00:02:53	@NaughtySquid	i think it's a mix between their own testers being busy and vp also being busy
2016-03-10 00:03:37	Ysblokje	Als they are "experimental" so no promises, other then they will support the game for another year on osX and Linux
2016-03-10 00:04:04	EddDeDuck	Syncing up also has a lot more checks the lats thing they want is for Linux/Mac to break Windows as Windows is your main money maker
2016-03-10 00:04:30	EddDeDuck	as soon as you have MP modes you need to check these things also cheating being easier (or not) on different platforms.
2016-03-10 00:04:34	EddDeDuck	Gets complex fast
2016-03-10 00:05:32	EddDeDuck	No clue about ARMA but I know having done a lot of frequently updated games and MP cross platform it’s walks more complex than you think
2016-03-10 00:06:51	@NaughtySquid	i dont remember that welcome screen being there Ysblokje
2016-03-10 00:06:57	Ysblokje	jup

2016-03-10 02:17:47	tadzik	I got a fairly quick response to the one I reported a week-or-so later, I wonder if the other one is just so scary and hairy that people prefer to pretend it doesn't exist, and I'd totally understand why :D
2016-03-10 02:18:09	EddDeDuck	It’s not one we’ve been able to repro

2016-03-10 02:18:32	tadzik	heh, I see
2016-03-10 02:18:54	tadzik	reproducing would probably be easier if I provided steps to reproduce, but the best I could do was a savefile :/
2016-03-10 02:18:56	EddDeDuck	If it stays about once we get the next batch of patches and DLC out we’ll see if it still happens
2016-03-10 02:19:00	tadzik	I'm not playing ironman since then
2016-03-10 02:20:52	EddDeDuck	Sorry to hear that, we haven’t forgotten about you :) just it’s a rare one off and we have a few fixes coming in that area of the game engine so we’ll hold off giving it high priority resources for now.
2016-03-10 02:21:18	EddDeDuck	:( Thanks for being understanding of the juggling of resources even though you have the bug
2016-03-10 02:23:00	EddDeDuck	Anyone here with Mesa/Crimson and an unsupported copy of MOrdor?
2016-03-10 02:23:17	tadzik	heh, no worries. I got it just once after ~70 hours of playtime, so not exactly a common occurence, I understand :)

2016-03-10 02:27:34	sziszi	maybe pirated
2016-03-10 02:27:53	tadzik	I'm guessing it's "played on amd" rather than "obtained illegally" :)

2016-03-10 02:29:37	EddDeDuck	mirv_ it plays yeah
2016-03-10 02:29:52	EddDeDuck	however many efefcts are missing due to Mesa missing features required to render
2016-03-10 02:30:04	mirv_	to be expected
2016-03-10 02:30:16	EddDeDuck	Weather effects, killer bees and environmental florishes missing

2016-03-10 02:32:11	mirv_	reminds me that I have other unsupported games to test out today at some point (I try to do so once every couple of weeks)
2016-03-10 02:32:13	EddDeDuck	Well I know Intel used it as part of their work on developing compute
2016-03-10 02:33:20	arnej	EddDeDuck: I have a copy but didn't try it yet because I hear it's not supported yet. Will try though
2016-03-10 02:33:52	mirv_	grid is unsupported still (I think) but works really nice with mesa
2016-03-10 02:34:16	arnej	Same here, grid runs really fine on mesa

2016-03-10 06:30:36	Half-Shot	With any luck we can push for 4.5 and then work on performance
2016-03-10 06:30:37	mirv_	Half-Shot, btw, did I ever mention that I couldn't get the benchmarks to run?
2016-03-10 06:31:43	Half-Shot	Err no?
2016-03-10 06:31:45	Half-Shot	Which ones?
2016-03-10 06:32:03	mirv_	the valve ones in particular
2016-03-10 06:32:12	mirv_	anything there, it just crashes the game
2016-03-10 06:33:28	Half-Shot	strange, I checked the files before I uploaded them :/
2016-03-10 06:33:51	Half-Shot	Well I can put the md5 sums up
2016-03-10 06:33:53	mirv_	I don't think it's the files
2016-03-10 06:34:11	mirv_	redownloaded as well, and nobody else seems to have issues with them
2016-03-10 06:34:21	Half-Shot	TF2 is totally broken for me right now, but that's not news
2016-03-10 06:34:29	Half-Shot	The others have been fine though :/
2016-03-10 06:34:53	mirv_	I suspect there's a library in there that causing problems (I do replace parts of the steam runtime to get it running)
2016-03-10 06:35:16	@NaughtySquid	okay
2016-03-10 06:35:16	@NaughtySquid	so
2016-03-10 06:35:22	@NaughtySquid	tonight i might put up gols newer code
2016-03-10 06:35:22	Half-Shot	The only bits I replace are the stdlibs and gcc
2016-03-10 06:35:26	@NaughtySquid	and hope i dont blow it up
2016-03-10 06:35:28	Half-Shot	dun dun duuuuuun
2016-03-10 06:35:35	Half-Shot	Did you learn git?
2016-03-10 06:36:17	mirv_	Half-Shot, that's all I replace too, but gentoo is gentoo
2016-03-10 06:36:26	mirv_	something else might not play nice
2016-03-10 06:36:29	@NaughtySquid	Half-Shot: yups

2016-03-10 06:38:02	Half-Shot	Ah that's fine

2016-03-10 07:32:47	Dwarden	well in theory 1.54 linux client can play together with 1.54 (legacy branch) windows but it must be on 1.54 server (both native win and linux) w/o battleye

2016-03-10 08:35:43	@NaughtySquid	maybe that's why it keeps resetting?

2016-03-10 08:36:52	@NaughtySquid	wonder if that works for me too
2016-03-10 08:36:57	tumocs	if I pick high as texture options (if i get it to show) it's going to drop to low and disappear
2016-03-10 08:37:40	@NaughtySquid	yeah that's what happens to me
2016-03-10 08:37:42	@NaughtySquid	ill pick high
2016-03-10 08:37:46	@NaughtySquid	it will show for a moment
2016-03-10 08:37:50	@NaughtySquid	then i can see visually it drop
2016-03-10 08:37:58	@NaughtySquid	then the options are only Low again
2016-03-10 08:38:45	Dwarden	naughtysquid texture setting is in profiles

2016-03-10 11:11:16	dabblers-buffet	But the way game critics view it is so different than how I view it.
2016-03-10 11:11:29	dabblers-buffet	I'm trying to understand what is so bad about that certain game.
2016-03-10 11:11:38	dabblers-buffet	I don't know if the reviews are biased or not.
2016-03-10 11:12:14	stqn	I wouldn't trust any "big site" review very much
2016-03-10 11:12:41	stqn	but usually it's the other way round…
2016-03-10 11:12:52	stqn	they give high ratings for poor games
2016-03-10 11:12:59	dabblers-buffet	Like Fallout 4?
2016-03-10 11:13:04	dabblers-buffet	Or Call Of Duty?
2016-03-10 11:13:08	dabblers-buffet	Those games have HIGH ratings.
2016-03-10 11:13:10	stqn	(bioshock, gta…)

2016-03-10 11:14:11	dabblers-buffet	Take for instance this link.
2016-03-10 11:14:12	dabblers-buffet	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review

2016-03-10 11:14:14	dabblers-buffet	Right here.
2016-03-10 11:14:15	stqn	only when I want to know if an Xbox game is worth buying, and I don’t buy these anymore :p
2016-03-10 11:14:30	dabblers-buffet	I feel like these reviews are not really direct.
2016-03-10 11:14:46	dabblers-buffet	The way they explain it.
2016-03-10 11:15:18	dabblers-buffet	They could just say, "This game has excellent graphics, really pulling you into the action as well as the sound which adds some realism to the environment you're playing in."

2016-03-10 11:15:48	dabblers-buffet	If you see this game on IGN's website, it has a 6/10.
2016-03-10 11:15:56	dabblers-buffet	An OK rating. :(
2016-03-10 11:16:10	dabblers-buffet	IGN seems to give games that sell very well positive reviews right?
2016-03-10 11:16:12	dabblers-buffet	Like GTA?

2016-03-10 11:16:44	stqn	that review is boring to read and I’m not interested in non-linux games so…
2016-03-10 11:17:03	dabblers-buffet	I wonder how are the reviews for linux games are on Gaming On Linux.
2016-03-10 11:17:09	dabblers-buffet	I haven't checked them out yet.
2016-03-10 11:17:59	stqn	depends on the author, but I’d say more readable :)
2016-03-10 11:18:35	dabblers-buffet	I'm guessing there is more detail & less bias in the reviews?
2016-03-10 11:18:48	dabblers-buffet	I need to find some cool games to play on Linux.
2016-03-10 11:18:55	dabblers-buffet	I heard about this game called Dirt Rally.
2016-03-10 11:18:58	dabblers-buffet	Sounds very fun. :D
2016-03-10 11:19:03	dabblers-buffet	Heard it was coming on Linux?
2016-03-10 11:19:04	stqn	eh

2016-03-10 17:03:03	madmachinations	You've finished it haven't you?
2016-03-10 17:03:25	Kallestofeles	Bound by Flame was pretty awesome in my opinion... playing it on hard was exactly the right difficulty for me, but the last boss... the devs should die for making the last boss fight.
2016-03-10 17:03:28	Kallestofeles	Nope.
2016-03-10 17:03:34	Kallestofeles	I never got past the last boss.
2016-03-10 17:03:43	Kallestofeles	Difficulty spike is just impossible.
2016-03-10 17:03:55	Kallestofeles	I was so pissed at the game.
2016-03-10 17:03:56	Kallestofeles	:D
2016-03-10 17:04:13	madmachinations	lol ouch xD, maybe you should give it another go having had time to cool off :P
2016-03-10 17:04:30	Kallestofeles	I tried for a week, a whole week just for the last fight.:D
2016-03-10 17:04:45	Kallestofeles	Then I removed my saved games and everything along with it.
2016-03-10 17:04:46	Kallestofeles	:D
2016-03-10 17:05:03	madmachinations	LOL that is quite the response xD
2016-03-10 17:05:05	Kallestofeles	But otherwise, it was an excellent title indeed.
2016-03-10 17:05:19	Kallestofeles	Ran smooth and looked georgeous.
2016-03-10 17:05:35	madmachinations	though I don't blame you for doing so, it must have been exceptionally frustrating
2016-03-10 17:05:38	Kallestofeles	Ok, 1sec, I'll get some coffee. :P

2016-03-10 21:15:35	drumr	yeah im going to a 5820k
2016-03-10 21:15:41	drumr	no integrated gpu
2016-03-10 21:19:47	Ysblokje	My new one has igpu but thats going to be used to encode video or something
2016-03-10 21:20:28	Fenix2412	Ysblokje: just use qsv :p
2016-03-10 21:20:43	Fenix2412	Ffmpeg should have it enabled by default
2016-03-10 21:21:01	Ysblokje	thats what I was going to do yes
2016-03-10 21:21:29	xpander69	nvenc ftw
2016-03-10 21:21:35	drumr	does the os run off the sd card on the raspberry pi or does it have an emmc module
2016-03-10 21:21:44	Fenix2412	xpander69: it works the same way
2016-03-10 21:22:04	Fenix2412	And qsv is even better because you don't use your main gpu
2016-03-10 21:22:32	xpander69	with nvenc you dont use your main gpu also, its different chip on the gpu afaik
2016-03-10 21:22:51	Fenix2412	xpander69: it still takes some fps
2016-03-10 21:23:14	xpander69	it takes some fps because of the syncing frames
2016-03-10 21:23:17	xpander69	same with qvs
2016-03-10 21:23:21	xpander69	if you want tearfree stuff
2016-03-10 21:26:58	xpander69	with skylake i think its pretty good though.. HVEC stuff etc

2016-03-10 21:27:56	Future_Suture	Half-Shot, you too!
2016-03-10 21:28:11	Fenix2412	xpander69: for me it is good enough even on haswell
2016-03-10 21:28:15	xpander69	my thoughts are that poor new users with amd gpus
2016-03-10 21:28:20	xpander69	no opengl 4.3 still i think?
2016-03-10 21:28:37	Fenix2412	Used it for the first time on windblows in obs
2016-03-10 21:28:43	mirv_	fglrx can be installed manually still
2016-03-10 21:28:53	xpander69	it can..but new users
2016-03-10 21:29:04	xpander69	no xorg 1.18 support either on fglrx i think?
2016-03-10 21:30:02	xpander69	well anyway, if you are new to linux and have amd gpu, you will have bad time anyway
2016-03-10 21:30:13	xpander69	doesnt matter really if fglrx is dropped or not
2016-03-10 21:30:14	xpander69	:D
2016-03-10 21:31:40	xpander69	Fenix2412, i dont do windows.. is this possible with linux OBS? i know that ffmpeg3.0 has qvs enabled but i dont see this option in SSR for example
2016-03-10 21:31:47	xpander69	but that might be because i dont have intel hardware :D
2016-03-10 21:32:57	Fenix2412	xpander69: you need intel igpu to do this xD
2016-03-10 21:33:14	xpander69	i know i need, but shouldnt the option show up still? :D
2016-03-10 21:33:22	xpander69	or it knows and hides it automatically :D
2016-03-10 21:33:23	Fenix2412	QSV = Intel Quick Sync Video
2016-03-10 21:33:28	xpander69	i know what it is :D
2016-03-10 21:33:46	Fenix2412	I don't know
2016-03-10 21:33:54	Fenix2412	Ask ffmpeg devs :D
2016-03-10 21:33:56	xpander69	you can compile nvenc without nvidia hardware also
2016-03-10 21:33:59	xpander69	but it just doesnt work :D
2016-03-10 21:34:39	Fenix2412	Maybe they did it differently for qsv
2016-03-10 21:34:53	xpander69	Fenix2412, i can ask but since you said you have used it i thought you can check it if your OBS shows that :D

2016-03-10 21:35:32	drumr	obs is on linux
2016-03-10 21:35:37	drumr	they have source and ubuntu
2016-03-10 21:35:44	Fenix2412	I'm in school right now
2016-03-10 21:35:59	drumr	other distros unofficial or you have to compile from source
2016-03-10 21:36:02	xpander69	drumr, yeah im too lazy to go through all the source..all i care is if it picks up qvs :D
2016-03-10 21:36:12	Fenix2412	Also I said that I used it on windows xpander69
2016-03-10 21:36:13	xpander69	if ffmpeg is with that
2016-03-10 21:36:27	xpander69	Fenix2412, yeah..but since you are on linux channel :D
2016-03-10 21:36:35	xpander69	you obviously have linux also? :D
2016-03-10 21:36:42	Fenix2412	Yes
2016-03-10 21:36:56	drumr	xpander what distro
2016-03-10 21:37:01	drumr	i may have forgotten
2016-03-10 21:37:07	xpander69	im on arch
2016-03-10 21:37:22	drumr	well they make compiling the source pretty good
2016-03-10 21:37:25	drumr	ive done it on two machines
2016-03-10 21:37:26	Fenix2412	Kubuntu 15.10 xD
2016-03-10 21:37:26	xpander69	ffmpeg3.0 has qvs enabled but SSR nor OBS shows that for me.. but that might be just because i dont have intel hardware:D
2016-03-10 21:37:40	Future_Suture	Samsai, did you see? :D
2016-03-10 21:37:57	xpander69	drumr, yeah and i have compiled OBS and SSR from git :P
2016-03-10 21:38:09	drumr	k
2016-03-10 21:38:12	drumr	i love obs
2016-03-10 21:38:21	drumr	when ive had trouble i went to the irc
2016-03-10 21:38:25	xpander69	i love SSR
2016-03-10 21:38:27	drumr	quakenet i believe
2016-03-10 21:38:31	xpander69	OBS is a bit slow
2016-03-10 21:38:35	xpander69	but its great for streaming
2016-03-10 21:38:36	drumr	is it?
2016-03-10 21:39:06	drumr	i had issues with ssr so i went with obs
2016-03-10 21:39:09	drumr	at least on linux
2016-03-10 21:39:10	xpander69	yeah ..for me is
2016-03-10 21:39:12	xpander69	i do use nvenc
2016-03-10 21:39:17	xpander69	on both.
2016-03-10 21:39:23	xpander69	but cant use nvenc for streaming sadly

2016-03-10 21:41:16	Fenix2412	xpander69: you can use nvenc to stream with obs
2016-03-10 21:42:51	Fenix2412	xpander69: you just need to use file output and give it a link to your stream
2016-03-10 21:43:46	xpander69	ahh this way..ok.. good to know
2016-03-10 21:44:06	Fenix2412	xpander69: i will tell you how when I get home
2016-03-10 21:44:56	xpander69	i dont stream much, but would be nice to know, since regular x264 is really slow, specialy on games that use lots of CPU
2016-03-10 21:45:17	Fenix2412	xpander69: also I recommend streaming to youtube
2016-03-10 21:45:40	Fenix2412	So you can set your bitrate higher than 3000k ...
2016-03-10 21:45:43	xpander69	i use hitbox when i stream once or twice a year :D

2016-03-10 21:47:46	xpander69	so under that file path i can just put url? :D
2016-03-10 21:47:52	Fenix2412	Yes
2016-03-10 21:47:55	xpander69	and ofc change the video bitrate then
2016-03-10 21:48:02	xpander69	cause 30k is obviously too much for stream
2016-03-10 21:48:14	Fenix2412	xpander69: it even says file path or url!
2016-03-10 21:48:17	Fenix2412	xD
2016-03-10 21:48:31	xpander69	yeah..and i can change output type to URL also
2016-03-10 21:48:43	xpander69	ist still strange though, why arent they adding it to Streaming tab
2016-03-10 21:49:09	Fenix2412	Dunno
2016-03-10 21:52:07	xpander69	nice...thanks for the help, i think i can manage now..will test later tonight how it performs..so i can use SSR for nvenc recording and OBS for nvenc streaming.. perfect combination so i dont have to fiddle with setting on any of them

2016-03-10 23:16:26	@Samsai	for as long as i've used an AMD GPU it's been an outdated piece of shit
2016-03-10 23:20:58	sziszi	what is not outdated in any debian/debian-based distro?
2016-03-10 23:23:27	@Samsai	debian sid may want to have a word with you
2016-03-10 23:24:40	@Samsai	anyway, when it comes to graphics drivers the software needs to be recent, especially on AMD

2016-03-10 23:29:21	@Samsai	sziszi, that's another point entirely
2016-03-10 23:29:33	@Samsai	you wanted updated stuff, i said sid has it :P
2016-03-10 23:30:13	tumocs	also sid has up to date packages sometimes
2016-03-10 23:30:39	sziszi	Im a spoiled arch user(not just switched to it, i was using arch before it was cool) with recent software, and it's stable

2016-03-11 00:10:25	Smilex	tumocs: what's the gist? Skimming it I see Azure mentioned, so I guess it's for servers? (I'd like to avoid reading the entire thing, if that wasn't obvious)
2016-03-11 00:10:50	tumocs	I wouldn't know, I'm not that interested. Something about sql.
2016-03-11 00:12:20	Cracker	It's mainly developed for their cloud right?

2016-03-11 00:30:37	Smilex	TomJepp: It was written as if it's a new thing, based on debian
2016-03-11 00:30:38	TomJepp	to go with the open compute project switches
2016-03-11 00:30:51	TomJepp	>The software is dubbed SONiC, aka Software for Open Networking in the Cloud. It's a toolkit of code and kernel patches to bend switch hardware to your will, so you can dictate how it works and what it can do, rather than relying on proprietary firmware from a traditional networking vendor.
2016-03-11 00:31:01	TomJepp	yes, it's the upgraded version of their old azure cloud switch OS
2016-03-11 00:31:22	TomJepp	which happens to be debian based.

2016-03-11 00:41:42	@Samsai	just because m$ made a linux distro we shouldn't forget where they have been taking their company recently
2016-03-11 00:42:20	TomJepp	Samsai: the SaaS Win10 approach?
2016-03-11 00:42:43	TomJepp	their interaction with OSS (and the amount they are releasing now!) is a lot improved though
2016-03-11 00:42:51	Cracker	The only reason they are at all toying with Linux and deploying things under Linux is they are losing their foothold
2016-03-11 00:42:51	mirv_	I don't trust it
2016-03-11 00:43:02	qptain_Nemo	also EEE :V
2016-03-11 00:43:10	gnarface	ditto on not trusting it
2016-03-11 00:43:11	Cracker	they are actually being smart and evolving with the times instead of being an idiot and thinking they are still the unbeatable giant they once were
2016-03-11 00:43:12	mirv_	MS are just trying their embrace, extend, extinguish strategy
2016-03-11 00:43:23	Cracker	But, they will always be the snake in the grass
2016-03-11 00:44:37	Raven67854	mirv_, Thankfully the GPL makes that really hard
2016-03-11 00:44:44	Kallestofeles	Don't you just love the way windows always updates something... never telling you exactly what it is that it's updating? :)))))
2016-03-11 00:44:57	Raven67854	Kallestofeles, we don't use windows so we have no clue what you're talking about
2016-03-11 00:45:09	@Samsai	Kallestofeles, oh they are just "updating" your settings to suit them better :P
2016-03-11 00:45:10	Kallestofeles	:D
2016-03-11 00:45:12	qptain_Nemo	i second Raven67854
2016-03-11 00:45:34	Raven67854	Cracker, I guess they figure since they can't get any foothold in the server market. To make tools for it instead.
2016-03-11 00:45:44	Kallestofeles	Samsai, yeah, the infamous "All your things are exactly as you left them..." - screen. :D
2016-03-11 00:45:52	mirv_	Raven67854, it'll make things hard, but still have to watch MS like a hawk
2016-03-11 00:45:54	Raven67854	Except all of your preferences
2016-03-11 00:46:09	Raven67854	mirv_, Oh of course but the GPL is ironclad. Also it infects other source code :D
2016-03-11 00:46:15	Raven67854	Thank you Mr. Stallman
2016-03-11 00:46:28	TomJepp	Kallestofeles: at win10. ;)
2016-03-11 00:46:34	TomJepp	*ah, Win10 even
2016-03-11 00:46:59	TomJepp	an absolutely hideous mess, even for playing games on. the last win10 update broke my xbox one controller ;)
2016-03-11 00:47:04	mirv_	Raven67854, I sure bet the top people at MS dislike the GPL
2016-03-11 00:47:13	Raven67854	mirv_, Good I hope it keeps them up at night
2016-03-11 00:47:25	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: well, theoretically one could still make a distro with a lot of proprietary software in it and apply EEE through it
2016-03-11 00:47:39	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Sure but Microsoft can't change Linux for example
2016-03-11 00:47:42	Raven67854	Which is more important
2016-03-11 00:47:52	Raven67854	There's nothing wrong/stopping you from making a distro loaded with closed software
2016-03-11 00:48:13	Raven67854	The issue is Microsoft embracing and killing Linux. As well as other FOSS projects. Hence why the GPL is important
2016-03-11 00:48:23	qptain_Nemo	well
2016-03-11 00:49:19	Raven67854	What are they going to do buy the Linux foundation? :P
2016-03-11 00:49:20	qptain_Nemo	i guess it does help prevent complete EEE i suppose
2016-03-11 00:49:36	Raven67854	Their usual tactics are moot in our world
2016-03-11 00:51:24	Kallestofeles	I'm no good at licenses or that stuff, but what if MS buys off Linus and it's Linux kernel? :D
2016-03-11 00:51:41	qptain_Nemo	i imagine Linux kernel has enormous amount of contributors
2016-03-11 00:51:55	Kallestofeles	That it does.
2016-03-11 00:51:57	qptain_Nemo	iirc they couldn't even relicense it to a newer GPL version because of it at some point
2016-03-11 00:52:01	Raven67854	Kallestofeles, Linus doesn't own the Linux kernel
2016-03-11 00:52:14	TomJepp	Kallestofeles: Linus only owns the copyright to sections of the linux kernel
2016-03-11 00:52:36	TomJepp	there are many contributors, and a lot of them are far far far more hard-line on the GPL than Linus is
2016-03-11 00:52:52	Kallestofeles	Ah, hmm, thanks for clearing it. :P
2016-03-11 00:52:59	@Samsai	relicensing is only allowed if all contributors agree or their contributions are removed
2016-03-11 00:53:14	Kallestofeles	Ok, that ain't happening then. :D
2016-03-11 00:53:29	@Samsai	so you would have to contact every single contributor, ask if it's okay and if not, remove and rewrite those areas of code
2016-03-11 00:53:37	Raven67854	Microsoft is just trying new avenues of revenue considering their pissed off their own user base
2016-03-11 00:53:51	gnarface	but what is important is nothing could retroactively apply to versions of the source already in the wild.  even in the event of a complete buyout of Linus himself, other people could continue the work starting with the most recently released version they managed to archive
2016-03-11 00:53:59	TomJepp	and there are a LOT of contributors who would disagree on principle.
2016-03-11 00:54:01	mirv_	even if somehow MS managed to grab rights to the kernel, it would be forked and renamed to syms (screw you microsoft)
2016-03-11 00:54:36	mirv_	even if they possibly got control, previous source releases are open, and therefore still freely available for all time
2016-03-11 00:54:50	qptain_Nemo	they wouldn't though
2016-03-11 00:55:12	Kallestofeles	Well, as long as they pump useless bloatware down their users' throats, give away the privacy and "own" everything that the end-user does on their system - I ain't stepping back into that hole.

2016-03-11 00:55:45	qptain_Nemo	huh?
2016-03-11 00:55:49	mirv_	I'm not concerned with the kernel - it's moves to control sql, eclipse, "cloud" access, etc, that worry me
2016-03-11 00:56:09	Raven67854	Eclipse is GPL
2016-03-11 00:56:09	gnarface	all microsoft will manage to do is steal a bunch of ubuntu users back over to microsoft software
2016-03-11 00:56:13	mirv_	I don't even trust mono
2016-03-11 00:56:27	Raven67854	Oh sorry its EPL
2016-03-11 00:56:30	qptain_Nemo	Kallestofeles: you mean security-wise or copyright-wise?
2016-03-11 00:56:32	Raven67854	mirv_, Mono is MIT/LGPL
2016-03-11 00:57:02	gnarface	microsoft will get their ubuntu users, but the important members of the linux community (the ~10,000 last sane IT people on the planet) will remain
2016-03-11 00:57:19	mirv_	Raven67854, but you can be what will happen if oracle ever wins against google
2016-03-11 00:57:20	jcastro	is there no way to make a single patreon donation to gol?
2016-03-11 00:57:22	Raven67854	mirv_, Hey look up the EPL haha
2016-03-11 00:57:37	Raven67854	mirv_, doesn't matter its still MIT/LGPL
2016-03-11 00:57:41	Raven67854	Also CoreCLR is MIT
2016-03-11 00:57:45	Raven67854	All of CoreCLR is mIT
2016-03-11 00:57:47	Raven67854	MIT*
2016-03-11 00:58:21	Kallestofeles	qptain_Nemo, I remember that when windows10 hit the market, there was a huge outburst regarding the eula - something in regards to "whatever you do/create on the win10 OS can be used as MS property" or something like that. Maybe I'm confusing it with the TechPreview eula - I don't recall very percisely nor am I good at eulas. :\
2016-03-11 00:58:27	mirv_	won't matter if MS basically control it anyway
2016-03-11 00:58:43	TomJepp	Kallestofeles: there was some interesting stuff about keylogging in the tech preview EULA
2016-03-11 00:58:52	Raven67854	mirv_, Yes it will because CoreCLR is MIT
2016-03-11 00:59:02	qptain_Nemo	Kallestofeles: that is... i'd really like clarification whether it only applies to the tech preview
2016-03-11 00:59:05	Raven67854	And CoreCLR is done by Microsoft
2016-03-11 00:59:28	Raven67854	I was quite shocked personally when I saw they released all of CoreCLR under MIT
2016-03-11 01:00:02	mirv_	all the more reason to be watchful
2016-03-11 01:00:17	Raven67854	Well not sure how
2016-03-11 01:00:33	Raven67854	With MIT you can just grab x version and fork if they get to be dicks about it
2016-03-11 01:00:38	mirv_	exactly, which is why I'm extremely suspicious
2016-03-11 01:00:50	Raven67854	Nothing they can do about it
2016-03-11 01:01:14	mirv_	they can try extend things with a "special" version at some point, which naturally only they have
2016-03-11 01:01:18	TomJepp	well the biggest problem there is that MIT doesn't include an explicit patent grant, afaik?
2016-03-11 01:01:25	Raven67854	mirv_, Do you even know what CoreCLR?
2016-03-11 01:01:48	Raven67854	TomJepp, No it doesn't but I don't think the GPL does either
2016-03-11 01:01:50	mirv_	isn't it the core .net runtime stuff?
2016-03-11 01:01:56	TomJepp	Raven67854: GPLv3 does, I think?
2016-03-11 01:02:05	Raven67854	mirv_, It's .net yes
2016-03-11 01:02:12	TomJepp	but CoreCLR and asp.net ending up on Linux is nice for me (commercially, I do .NET dev amongst other things)
2016-03-11 01:02:26	Raven67854	CoreFX adds the rest of .net(also MIT)
2016-03-11 01:02:30	TomJepp	not having to use windows server to host things would be beautiful. ;)
2016-03-11 01:02:36	Raven67854	TomJepp, I don't think GPLv3 does either
2016-03-11 01:02:50	mirv_	well MS aren't doing it to be nice, you can bet they'll be up to something

2016-03-11 01:03:43	TomJepp	 mirv_ : I'm pretty sure they're doing it to firm up their .NET position in the face of node.js, ruby, etc etc
2016-03-11 01:03:57	Raven67854	After they say .net is bad
2016-03-11 01:04:03	Raven67854	And people should only use non managed code
2016-03-11 01:04:19	Raven67854	Then people didn't switch!
2016-03-11 01:04:36	mirv_	TomJepp, ok...but why?
2016-03-11 01:04:42	TomJepp	Raven67854: when did MS say .NET is bad? ;)
2016-03-11 01:04:48	Raven67854	TomJepp, Few years ago
2016-03-11 01:04:53	mirv_	why do they want people to use something they open sourced?
2016-03-11 01:04:59	TomJepp	Raven67854: I'm going to need a source for that. ;)
2016-03-11 01:05:11	Raven67854	It's typical Microsoft bullshit
2016-03-11 01:05:28	TomJepp	mirv_: because getting startups and other businesses onto .NET, as well as students gets them onto the MS dev environment and using MS tech
2016-03-11 01:05:30	Raven67854	first they build C# into a great developer ecosystem. Then everybody is using it. so they change their minds and now want people to use C++
2016-03-11 01:05:44	Raven67854	TomJepp, This is their reason for killing Xna
2016-03-11 01:05:46	TomJepp	the more they use MS tech the more likely they are to recommend it when they have purchasing authority
2016-03-11 01:05:55	Raven67854	They think .net is great for web/asp.net stuff

2016-03-11 01:06:22	Raven67854	I assume they said all of that. Because they wanted people to use C++ for the then upcoming XboxOne
2016-03-11 01:06:42	Raven67854	And win10 platform. but they backtracked on it all because everybody thought their reasoning was dumb
2016-03-11 01:06:46	Raven67854	Hence why we have .net native
2016-03-11 01:06:50	TomJepp	Raven67854: they killed XNA to push universal apps
2016-03-11 01:06:55	mirv_	TomJepp, but MS will only be concerned about that if there's a monetary reason
2016-03-11 01:07:00	qptain_Nemo	wow i'm confused
2016-03-11 01:07:09	Raven67854	Nothing Microsoft does makes sense
2016-03-11 01:07:12	Raven67854	They just randomly kill things
2016-03-11 01:07:17	TomJepp	mirv_: >the more likely they are to recommend it when they have purchasing authority
2016-03-11 01:07:32	TomJepp	i.e. selling visual studio, MSDN subs, windows server licenses, etc
2016-03-11 01:07:46	Raven67854	I hate .net native
2016-03-11 01:07:51	Raven67854	It's slow..
2016-03-11 01:09:06	Raven67854	TomJepp, Also sure they killed Xna for that. Even though having a game API like that could of been helpful. But all universal apps made in anything .net are actually .net native apps.
2016-03-11 01:09:21	TomJepp	Raven67854: release builds are, yes
2016-03-11 01:09:30	Raven67854	Yes
2016-03-11 01:09:38	TomJepp	Raven67854: the other issue with XNA is that it was tied to DirectX9. it would have needed a fundamental rewrite for DX11
2016-03-11 01:09:40	Raven67854	Because releasing a debug as your final build would be fucking retarded
2016-03-11 01:09:44	Raven67854	So?
2016-03-11 01:09:53	Raven67854	Sounds like a silly argument
2016-03-11 01:10:11	TomJepp	so they would have had to do something basically from scratch anyway
2016-03-11 01:10:13	Raven67854	writing a shitty .net bytecode -> native code compiler is also a massive pain in the ass
2016-03-11 01:10:21	Raven67854	They were willing to do that
2016-03-11 01:10:43	Raven67854	who cares if it runs slower! It starts faster :D
2016-03-11 01:11:07	TomJepp	I've not actually benchmarked it, but for GUI apps I'll admit I've not noticed a performance difference

2016-03-11 01:12:09	Raven67854	Well yeah but for games or anything intensive its slower
2016-03-11 01:12:16	Raven67854	Slower than .net
2016-03-11 01:12:32	Raven67854	I just don't understand their decisions sometimes
2016-03-11 01:12:49	qptain_Nemo	heh
2016-03-11 01:13:12	qptain_Nemo	this made me think of a theory
2016-03-11 01:13:51	TomJepp	I'm waiting for the linux based CLR to get better though. all of my personal and business server stuff is linux-based now - windows server licensing is expensive, and windows server VMs are too resource heavy.
2016-03-11 01:14:04	TomJepp	whereas a nice debian VM? :)
2016-03-11 01:14:08	Raven67854	TomJepp, Isn't the new win10 server version expensive

2016-03-11 01:14:53	Raven67854	TomJepp, well doesn't really matter they changed the server licensing.
2016-03-11 01:14:56	Raven67854	You pay per core now
2016-03-11 01:15:12	Raven67854	And you have to purchase a min amount of "cores"
2016-03-11 01:15:17	TomJepp	Raven67854: I vaguely remember that - because their old licensing was per CPU?
2016-03-11 01:15:20	Raven67854	It's even more expensive than before
2016-03-11 01:15:25	Raven67854	TomJepp, Yes
2016-03-11 01:15:30	TomJepp	and their logic is "modern CPUs have up to 18 cores!"
2016-03-11 01:15:50	Raven67854	Either way it costs a lot more for anybody using it
2016-03-11 01:16:04	qptain_Nemo	i just realized that if Valve put all their effort into making SteamOS awesome *after* MS fully went through with making Windows a closed platform that would be perhaps perfect timing
2016-03-11 01:16:18	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Better to have it ready than wait
2016-03-11 01:16:52	 < 	synth (~4synth]@unaffiliated/synth) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-03-11 01:17:03	@Samsai	currently people haven't bought anything particularly important from the microsoft store
2016-03-11 01:17:18	Raven67854	I'd love to know how good Tomb Raider sold
2016-03-11 01:17:28	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: on one hand i agree, but imagine the situation i've described
2016-03-11 01:17:33	@Samsai	so it's easier to convert them to steamos users now than it is when they have already invested in the store
2016-03-11 01:17:36	Raven67854	Or quantum break when that comes out
2016-03-11 01:17:56	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Why not be awesome and be ready for the people to join us :P
2016-03-11 01:18:19	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: MS would be wary and prepare to back out and keep fighting
2016-03-11 01:18:27	Raven67854	Good
2016-03-11 01:18:28	qptain_Nemo	instead of arrogantly committing 100% to their new shit
2016-03-11 01:18:31	Raven67854	They shouldn't be doing that in the first place
2016-03-11 01:18:39	@Samsai	going back and forth will look stupid too
2016-03-11 01:19:11	@Samsai	if microsoft repeatedly makes stupid mistakes and then backs out when people start complaining they will look bad regardless
2016-03-11 01:19:28	Raven67854	We're on the fringe though
2016-03-11 01:19:28	TomJepp	Samsai: you're going to need a lot more native day1 releases before you can get *real* movement to SteamOS from Windows
2016-03-11 01:19:33	qptain_Nemo	they have looked bad forever, i'd say it's not enough
2016-03-11 01:19:41	Raven67854	Most people do NOT care about the things we do
2016-03-11 01:19:41	TomJepp	and ones where the performance isn't bad comparative to windows
2016-03-11 01:20:08	TomJepp	and no, the average gamer does not care if the performance issues are because of bad drivers ;)
2016-03-11 01:20:21	Raven67854	It's not drivers on Linux
2016-03-11 01:20:26	Raven67854	At least not if you use Nvidia
2016-03-11 01:20:38	Raven67854	There's only so much you can squeeze out of a d3d -> GL layer
2016-03-11 01:20:49	Raven67854	You're going to have overhead from such a thing
2016-03-11 01:21:06	Raven67854	Convince developers to make games with OpenGL or Vulkan from the get go
2016-03-11 01:21:09	gnarface	so, still no takers for civ5 today?
2016-03-11 01:21:20	TomJepp	Raven67854: well... there's AMD still as well
2016-03-11 01:21:26	Raven67854	TomJepp, AMD doesn't count
2016-03-11 01:21:32	*	Raven67854 pushes them under the rug
2016-03-11 01:21:58	TomJepp	yeah, dumping 30% at least of the market just doesn't matter ;)
2016-03-11 01:22:03	Raven67854	Pfffft
2016-03-11 01:22:09	Raven67854	they aren't 30% on Linux
2016-03-11 01:22:49	Raven67854	Also it's not our or Linux's fault the drivers just plain suck. Go get AMD to fix that. Then again AMD has meh drivers on Windows
2016-03-11 01:22:53	TomJepp	no, but if you want to convert people from windows *to* linux, they are on windows.
2016-03-11 01:23:03	Fenix2412	ah
2016-03-11 01:23:08	Fenix2412	finally at home
2016-03-11 01:23:14	mirv_	on a separate note, why would qjoypad detect my (xinput) gamepad, but all games fail to do so?
2016-03-11 01:23:19	Fenix2412	Hello ppl
2016-03-11 01:23:26	Raven67854	mirv_, games are coded like shit
2016-03-11 01:23:28	TomJepp	Raven67854: I'm not sure I'd agree with you on that. my AMD card doesn't randomly hang at the desktop unlike recent NVIDIA drivers ;)
2016-03-11 01:23:49	TomJepp	or hang the GPU while running chrome ;) that one persisted for several NVIDIA releases!
2016-03-11 01:23:49	Raven67854	TomJepp, I don't have Windows to test Nvidia. But I've never had those issues
2016-03-11 01:23:58	TomJepp	Raven67854: recent driver releases on Windows.
2016-03-11 01:23:58	mirv_	Raven67854, true enough, but it doesn't help me much
2016-03-11 01:24:11	Raven67854	mirv_, I know =/. But you asked why.
2016-03-11 01:24:22	Raven67854	TomJepp, yeah I'm not going to install Windows to check
2016-03-11 01:24:45	TomJepp	Raven67854: then kindly don't spout very outdated misconceptions as fact? ;)
2016-03-11 01:24:47	Raven67854	I'm on the beta vulkan drivers.. Really surprised I'm having no issues
2016-03-11 01:24:51	mirv_	vi: command not found
2016-03-11 01:24:53	mirv_	.....ok
2016-03-11 01:25:01	Raven67854	TomJepp, It's not outdated.. I have friends with AMD always bitching to me
2016-03-11 01:25:11	mirv_	when did I get vim uninstalled?
2016-03-11 01:25:20	Raven67854	Everybody I know with Nvidia isn't having any issues
2016-03-11 01:25:21	*	Raven67854 shrugs
2016-03-11 01:25:23	qptain_Nemo	friends
2016-03-11 01:25:26	@Samsai	mirv_, maybe ed still works? :P
2016-03-11 01:25:27	Raven67854	Such is the life of windows and drivers
2016-03-11 01:25:33	Raven67854	mirv_, Because you became a heretic and installed emacs
2016-03-11 01:25:34	qptain_Nemo	more like the entire #gamingonlinux
2016-03-11 01:25:41	TomJepp	I personally see a lot more NVIDIA issues recently. it comes and goes side-to-side.
2016-03-11 01:25:47	mirv_	Samsai, nano is still there
2016-03-11 01:25:49	Raven67854	Indeed
2016-03-11 01:25:50	TomJepp	they're both as bad as each other, in my eyes
2016-03-11 01:25:55	@Samsai	mirv_, good, that's all you need
2016-03-11 01:26:01	@Samsai	#nanomasterrace
2016-03-11 01:26:02	mirv_	Raven67854, of course I did, but I never removed vim
2016-03-11 01:26:04	Raven67854	Well it's annoying writing drivers for every fucking thing I'm sure
2016-03-11 01:26:07	Fenix2412	well
2016-03-11 01:26:12	Fenix2412	I wonder if they fixed the issue
2016-03-11 01:26:12	Raven67854	mirv_, Should burn at the stake
2016-03-11 01:26:16	Fenix2412	with VGA output

2016-03-11 01:26:32	Raven67854	Who the hell uses VGA
2016-03-11 01:26:35	Fenix2412	me
2016-03-11 01:26:38	Raven67854	=/
2016-03-11 01:26:40	TomJepp	Raven67854: a surprisingly large number of people
2016-03-11 01:26:41	Raven67854	I'm so sorry
2016-03-11 01:26:54	Raven67854	TomJepp, Pretty sure it's smaller than people using DVI/HDMI at this point
2016-03-11 01:27:02	Fenix2412	Raven67854, come to poland and work here
2016-03-11 01:27:06	Fenix2412	then you will be sorry
2016-03-11 01:27:10	Raven67854	No
2016-03-11 01:27:14	TomJepp	well if you want to be picky, more people are probably using eDP or similar ;)
2016-03-11 01:27:17	sziszi	im using VGA at work
2016-03-11 01:27:18	TomJepp	laptops, yay!
2016-03-11 01:27:19	mirv_	Fenix2412, I like Poland
2016-03-11 01:27:26	Raven67854	TomJepp, mmmm I do like being picky
2016-03-11 01:27:45	mirv_	pierogi and parowki are two of my favourite foods now
2016-03-11 01:27:45	TomJepp	but I see a LOT of people using VGA on old monitors
2016-03-11 01:27:56	TomJepp	I mean I wouldn't *want* to ;)
2016-03-11 01:28:02	Fenix2412	mirv_, hm then you have to try bigos if you haven't already
2016-03-11 01:28:08	TomJepp	I'm mostly displayport here now :)
2016-03-11 01:28:21	Raven67854	I have to use display port
2016-03-11 01:28:24	mirv_	Fenix2412, bigos I haven't heard of yet
2016-03-11 01:28:27	Raven67854	Otherwise I can't use my monitors
2016-03-11 01:28:32	TomJepp	analogue outputs make me sad ;)
2016-03-11 01:28:50	Raven67854	TomJepp, Don't make fun of Fenix2412
2016-03-11 01:29:01	Fenix2412	mirv_, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigos

2016-03-11 01:29:05	mirv_	Fenix2412, after googling, I think I Have tried that
2016-03-11 01:29:16	mirv_	boiled cabbage is not to my liking, sadly
2016-03-11 01:29:21	Fenix2412	TomJepp, if I ever meet you
2016-03-11 01:29:24	Fenix2412	you will meet my hammer
2016-03-11 01:29:44	Raven67854	I have dual 4k screens <3. Worlds best screens to code on
2016-03-11 01:29:45	TomJepp	Fenix2412: I... still hate VGA. ;)
2016-03-11 01:29:58	Fenix2412	mirv_, k... thou it does have a very nice taste
2016-03-11 01:30:04	qptain_Nemo	why do you actively hate VGA?
2016-03-11 01:30:11	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Because he's a snob
2016-03-11 01:30:15	mirv_	Fenix2412, I suspect my eyes dislike it more than my tastebuds
2016-03-11 01:30:18	Fenix2412	I like it sour
2016-03-11 01:30:23	gnarface	i think analog is neat
2016-03-11 01:30:33	gnarface	i like the way VGA makes standard-def NTSC look
2016-03-11 01:30:35	TomJepp	Raven67854: yes, but also because I like text to be sharp and most LCD monitors with VGA inputs I see are terrible
2016-03-11 01:30:43	mirv_	zureck (with proper spelling) is nice
2016-03-11 01:30:45	Raven67854	TomJepp, Do you have 4k screens?
2016-03-11 01:31:06	Fenix2412	mirv_, yes with white kiełbasa
2016-03-11 01:31:09	TomJepp	Raven67854: I have a 4K screen, a 1440p screen, two 1920x1200 screens and a 2880x1800 display
2016-03-11 01:31:15	TomJepp	oh, and a 2048x1536 display!
2016-03-11 01:31:17	Raven67854	I just have 2 4k's
2016-03-11 01:31:23	Raven67854	Do you have all of those hooked up?
2016-03-11 01:31:25	TomJepp	(these are not all on the same devices)
2016-03-11 01:31:28	Raven67854	Ah
2016-03-11 01:31:32	Raven67854	Yeah I have other monitors
2016-03-11 01:31:40	mirv_	Fenix2412, I used to have that all the time on a particular train
2016-03-11 01:31:44	Raven67854	I can't use anything other than 4k now :(
2016-03-11 01:31:50	Raven67854	Looks so bad
2016-03-11 01:32:24	TomJepp	Raven67854: High DPI displays spoil you for normal ones ;)
2016-03-11 01:32:30	mirv_	and I also like Polish ham - no idea why, but it tastes nicer than in other countries I've been to
2016-03-11 01:32:30	Raven67854	They sure do
2016-03-11 01:32:33	TomJepp	text looks awesome rendered at higher DPI :)
2016-03-11 01:32:45	Raven67854	Text on windows is still mehhhhh though
2016-03-11 01:32:52	Fenix2412	mirv_, probably because of the technique it's made in
2016-03-11 01:33:22	mirv_	even the dodgy train sandwiches tasted really good
2016-03-11 01:33:56	Fenix2412	:D
2016-03-11 01:33:58	TomJepp	Raven67854: depends which renderer to me ;) the DirectWrite renderer is pretty nice imo, the cleartype one is *weird*. it doesn't seem to smooth in some directions, and it tries really hard to align vertical lines to pixels
2016-03-11 01:34:21	TomJepp	which can make some characters look oddly distorted
2016-03-11 01:34:27	mirv_	I do like it here, but miss Poland sometimes
2016-03-11 01:34:28	Raven67854	Well I was at a friends house and he has win10 with 4k screen. Meh
2016-03-11 01:34:41	Fenix2412	mirv_, hmm where are you from actually?
2016-03-11 01:34:44	qptain_Nemo	why is he still your friend
2016-03-11 01:34:44	mirv_	...except in winter, I don't miss a Polish winter

2016-03-11 01:35:50	mirv_	I know they can't kill me
2016-03-11 01:36:13	Fenix2412	I just wear a hoodie

2016-03-11 01:40:01	Fenix2412	Samsai, yeah yeah we all know that you people heat up using that soviet vodka that soviets left when they were running away from finland
2016-03-11 01:40:03	mirv_	what the? gentoo, why did you remove nano from my world file again?
2016-03-11 01:40:15	Fenix2412	mirv_, magic
2016-03-11 01:41:09	@Samsai	Fenix2412, i can tell you, the soviet vodka didn't last over 50 years
2016-03-11 01:41:30	@Samsai	i think every last drop was gone after 2 weeks
2016-03-11 01:41:45	Fenix2412	Samsai, also you people heat up the closer you get to each other
2016-03-11 01:41:59	Fenix2412	that's why you keep distance because we don't want a supernova on earth
2016-03-11 01:45:23	mirv_	can I make a joke there?
2016-03-11 01:45:32	mirv_	it's related to people heating up as they get closer

2016-03-11 01:54:32	sneke	Steam's own update thing just broke it, for some reason
2016-03-11 01:54:41	qptain_Nemo	weird
2016-03-11 01:55:08	sneke	A lot of libGL errors, which have occured before without issues, if I recall correctly
2016-03-11 01:55:18	mirv_	you let steam update drivers for you?
2016-03-11 01:55:31	sneke	no, I don't think so
2016-03-11 01:55:39	Future_Suture	http://nichegamer.com/2016/03/nordic-games-picks-up-battle-chasers-nightwar-to-aid-in-development/ mentions the game is coming to Linux, but the actual Kickstarter campaign does not. Anybody know? Also, hidekin_, this might interest you.

2016-03-11 01:55:59	sneke	but I ran `$ steam` and then it downloaded like, 200MB of _something_, and then it didn't start
2016-03-11 01:56:15	mirv_	you're using the FOSS drivers, though?
2016-03-11 01:56:22	sneke	yea?
2016-03-11 01:56:53	mirv_	yeah, it'll be libgcc.* and libstdc++.* in the steam runtime causing problems
2016-03-11 01:57:13	sneke	ah, I guess those were downloaded again
2016-03-11 01:57:28	sneke	.. now where is that command
2016-03-11 01:57:53	egon2003	sneke: find ~/.local/share/Steam/ \( -name "libgcc_s.so*" -o -name "libstdc++.so*" \) -print -delete
2016-03-11 01:58:04	sneke	Thanks
2016-03-11 01:59:35	sneke	rightyo, that fixed it
2016-03-11 02:01:08	mirv_	maybe this thing wants xpad installed as a module

2016-03-11 02:36:54	DePingus	I have to convert my Win7 key to 10 anyways.
2016-03-11 02:37:21	TomJepp	I've just wiped my win10 install and put win8 back!
2016-03-11 02:37:37	TomJepp	silly MS breaking xbox controllers
2016-03-11 02:38:00	DePingus	I hate win10...but I might as well get my free key by upgrading my Win7.
2016-03-11 02:38:31	TomJepp	they don't give you a key, it logs your hardware ID in their database as "allowed to activate win10"
2016-03-11 02:38:57	DePingus	Hmm. I thought there was some win10 key extractor that you can use to re-install Win10 in the future?
2016-03-11 02:39:16	TomJepp	they use a single generic key for all win7/win8 upgrades
2016-03-11 02:39:37	TomJepp	you can actually install using the latest windows 10 media using your original win7 key anyway - it should accept it at install time
2016-03-11 02:40:42	DePingus	Interesting. I would still need to upgrade my machine to win10 to register my hardware for the future?
2016-03-11 02:41:28	TomJepp	maybe not a bad idea just to cover yourself
2016-03-11 02:41:56	DePingus	Cool. That's what I was thinking.
2016-03-11 02:41:58	TomJepp	I'm still wary of win10 for now though. the rolling combined updates with absolutely no information about what they change frustrates me a LOT
2016-03-11 02:42:05	DePingus	Know anything about dual booting?
2016-03-11 02:42:49	josefnpat	windows has this nasty habit of thinkint it's the only OS in existance. If you install windows as a dual boot, be sure to install it first.
2016-03-11 02:43:00	josefnpat	Otherwise, I put it on it's very own physical drive.
2016-03-11 02:43:12	TomJepp	if you install windows second, be aware you'll need to fix GRUB/whatever other bootloader you use
2016-03-11 02:43:13	DePingus	thats exactly what i was going to ask. what to install first.
2016-03-11 02:43:17	homerj	that's what I do
2016-03-11 02:43:21	TomJepp	it's much easier to install windows first
2016-03-11 02:43:30	DePingus	i actually do have 2 drives.
2016-03-11 02:43:30	TomJepp	(not that fixing grub is *that* hard)
2016-03-11 02:43:31	homerj	Windows should just get its own drive
2016-03-11 02:44:15	josefnpat	that's how I do it
2016-03-11 02:44:30	DePingus	ok cool. that pretty much answers all my questions.
2016-03-11 02:44:33	homerj	Windows on one drive, Linux on the other, set the bios to boot into the Linux drive, then have whatever bootloader boot Windows
2016-03-11 02:44:53	josefnpat	make sure the bootloader is on the respective os's drive
2016-03-11 02:45:11	josefnpat	you can install th ebootloader on one drive, and have it boot off the other
2016-03-11 02:45:21	josefnpat	which can get hairy to fix
2016-03-11 02:45:37	homerj	I'm not exactly sure how to do this in efi stuff
2016-03-11 02:45:42	DePingus	hmm
2016-03-11 02:45:48	homerj	but bios you can just smack F12 or whatever and change what you boot
2016-03-11 02:45:54	DePingus	i'll have to look into that part
2016-03-11 02:45:59	homerj	if you didn't want to have Linux boot windows
2016-03-11 02:46:30	DePingus	i want linux to be the main OS that boots automatically without intervention.
2016-03-11 02:46:31	homerj	I solved the issue by just not having Windows
2016-03-11 02:47:44	DePingus	i think i had turned off EFI on my BIOS
2016-03-11 02:47:59	DePingus	might just use the bios's boot menu to select windows when i need it
2016-03-11 02:48:00	josefnpat	homerj: works for me
2016-03-11 02:50:55	mirv_	got it, steam runtime libsdl2 to blame
2016-03-11 02:51:18	DePingus	i tried getting rid of windows in january but it seems that i can't
2016-03-11 02:52:14	DePingus	messing with graphics drivers in linux is just too much
2016-03-11 02:52:18	frostwork	i tried using windows for 3 months but it seems that i can't

2016-03-11 02:55:41	homerj	see, I never understood the whole graphic driver thing
2016-03-11 02:55:57	homerj	Ubuntu, there's a couple PPAs you just have to add, Arch they are just packaged
2016-03-11 02:56:04	homerj	you don't even have to hunt down updates
2016-03-11 02:57:21	homerj	the last graphic driver issue I had, was when nvidia went to the libvnd thing, and their first release was broken, and I had to build another libvnd
2016-03-11 02:59:25	DePingus	running amd. i had to downgrade xorg to get catalyst to work
2016-03-11 02:59:52	DePingus	i ha to install catalyst because the opensouce mesa driver was terrible in xcom2

2016-03-11 03:00:34	homerj	there's a repo you add, and it handles all that stuff for you

2016-03-11 03:01:25	DePingus	I was using antergos. And I got catalyst working by adding the repos and downgrading xorg. There were a few glitches but I was able to solve them.
2016-03-11 03:02:03	homerj	I never liked "off shoot" distros
2016-03-11 03:02:06	DePingus	I tried to revert to the mesa drivers to see if the xcom2 patch inproved performace there (I had heard that Feral was working with the mesa drivers for the patch).
2016-03-11 03:02:12	homerj	I'd rather just get things from the horse's mouth
2016-03-11 03:02:14	BTRE	Isn't catalyst worse on xcom 2? That's the impression I got from EddDeDuck talking about it.
2016-03-11 03:02:22	homerj	not have yet another group of people try and decide what's what
2016-03-11 03:02:23	BTRE	Or maybe I'm getting mixed up with grid.
2016-03-11 03:02:43	homerj	Ubuntu used to be the exception, because of Debian's slow release cycles
2016-03-11 03:02:50	homerj	they have since sped them up
2016-03-11 03:02:53	DePingus	catalyst made xcom2 somewhat playable for me before thee patch. after the patch it was even a little better.
2016-03-11 03:03:20	DePingus	pre-patch xcom2 was totally unplayable for me on mesa
2016-03-11 03:04:25	homerj	I don't really even know at this point if I'd call Ubuntu a release of Debian at this point
2016-03-11 03:04:38	homerj	they use a lot of the core packages obviously, but they have too much of their own stuff now
2016-03-11 03:07:37	DePingus	I've never run ubuntu on the desktop. All my VMs run the server though
2016-03-11 03:08:34	DePingus	what i like most about ubuntu is that you can google any solution
2016-03-11 03:08:59	DePingus	love that about arch too
2016-03-11 03:09:14	TomJepp	arch's wiki is a great info source
2016-03-11 03:09:39	DePingus	i used to run arch/openbox all the time, but the setup is just too time consuming now days.
2016-03-11 03:09:45	calexil	indeed
2016-03-11 03:10:03	TomJepp	heh, I moved to arch on the desktop from gentoo. anything's faster than gentoo
2016-03-11 03:10:04	DePingus	the wiki and the forums (reading, rarely posting) were great
2016-03-11 03:10:29	openfbtd	I have no idea how is it time-consuming if you don't want to tinker atm
2016-03-11 03:10:29	TomJepp	recompiling Qt for the *nth* time got annoying
2016-03-11 03:10:41	homerj	Arch's wiki isn't even all that Arch specific
2016-03-11 03:11:09	openfbtd	If I don't change shit in my graphical setup, it works unless some upstream bugs come around, and that's rare or rarely critical
2016-03-11 03:11:46	Marezz	umm, is it possible to game with intel hd from i5 4460?
2016-03-11 03:12:12	openfbtd	fluxbox broke once on an update
2016-03-11 03:12:16	DePingus	thats the key right there...if you don't change shit in your graphical setup. I'm impatient. XCOM2 just came out. I downloaded it. I want to play it NOW. Not wait for patches.

2016-03-11 03:43:03	openfbtd	>100 hrs on record heh
2016-03-11 03:43:26	openfbtd	Will probably go at least another ~10 hours
2016-03-11 03:43:52	tadzik	some legend levelsjust make nosense at all
2016-03-11 03:43:56	tadzik	stamina increase? :D
2016-03-11 03:44:03	openfbtd	Eh, they just half-assed it
2016-03-11 03:44:14	openfbtd	The bow upgrade affects the crossbow
2016-03-11 03:44:18	openfbtd	And is INSANE
2016-03-11 03:44:26	tadzik	and it takes 125 levelups to cap it :P
2016-03-11 03:44:33	openfbtd	I have a 1200 damage crossbow now
2016-03-11 03:44:35	openfbtd	It's fucked
2016-03-11 03:44:52	openfbtd	Oneshots demolishers with a headshot
2016-03-11 03:44:53	tadzik	that's decent
2016-03-11 03:44:59	tadzik	wow
2016-03-11 03:45:08	openfbtd	You do need to aim the thing though
2016-03-11 03:45:31	openfbtd	I'll put another level into the bow and keep upgrading melee weapon damage though
2016-03-11 03:45:41	openfbtd	I have 2000+ melee weapons as is
2016-03-11 03:46:10	openfbtd	It forces you to diversify btw
2016-03-11 03:46:21	DePingus	Alright guyes. Thanks for the info. Its lunch time!

2016-03-11 03:46:56	openfbtd	I've upgraded bow and one-handed so far
2016-03-11 03:47:00	openfbtd	OH
2016-03-11 03:47:03	openfbtd	OOOOH
2016-03-11 03:47:14	openfbtd	That's why my machetes match the premium katana
2016-03-11 03:47:18	openfbtd	Damage-wise
2016-03-11 03:47:44	openfbtd	I forgot that the melee upgrades for one- and two-handed weapons are separate

2016-03-11 04:59:14	psymin	Which games in this list are the best/most fun for a room of gamers on a LAN?  http://runlinux.net/lan-ready.txt
2016-03-11 04:59:53	TomJepp	surely that depends on your gamers! if they are a bunch of shooter fanatics or prefer slower paced games
2016-03-11 05:00:03	psymin	Random mixture :)
2016-03-11 05:00:12	Cracker	and how many gamers
2016-03-11 05:00:13	TomJepp	I mean I love Civ5 MP, but it's quite slow paced
2016-03-11 05:00:15	Cracker	a lot of those are 4 player max
2016-03-11 05:00:32	psymin	Four players, or eight, depending
2016-03-11 05:00:50	Cracker	left 4 dead 2 vrs is always a lot of fun with 8
2016-03-11 05:00:59	psymin	cool
2016-03-11 05:01:14	TomJepp	or the co-op is good fun with 4.
2016-03-11 05:01:25	Cracker	yes indeed
2016-03-11 05:01:29	Cracker	it's a good game
2016-03-11 05:01:54	Cracker	especially seeing if someone has to get up they can put their character in AI mode for a minute when they get another beer ;)
2016-03-11 05:02:04	psymin	eek!
2016-03-11 05:02:06	TomJepp	7 days to die is a long game - I wouldn't have called it LAN party material
2016-03-11 05:02:16	Cracker	and it's terrible now :(
2016-03-11 05:02:25	TomJepp	I haven't played it since A13 ;)
2016-03-11 05:02:36	Cracker	yah, the latest update is aweful
2016-03-11 05:02:42	Cracker	my gaming group tried it the other day
2016-03-11 05:02:53	psymin	I haven't played it recently
2016-03-11 05:02:59	Cracker	I use to really enjoy it
2016-03-11 05:03:01	@Samsai	system shock 2 isn't actually co-op on linux
2016-03-11 05:03:16	@Samsai	the network part doesn't like wine, or the other way around

2016-03-11 05:03:22	TomJepp	that game was never balanced for co-op anyway
2016-03-11 05:03:30	TomJepp	except through mods
2016-03-11 05:03:38	Cracker	One game that was kinda fun
2016-03-11 05:03:42	@Samsai	yeah, it's very much an SP experience
2016-03-11 05:03:55	Cracker	ohhh wait, you just have half life 2 death match?
2016-03-11 05:03:57	@Samsai	i've started a let's play of it to force myself to actually play through it
2016-03-11 05:04:00	Cracker	or do you have half life 2 as well?
2016-03-11 05:04:12	psymin	hl2dm is stand alone iirc
2016-03-11 05:04:12	@Samsai	i don't want to play anymore though :D
2016-03-11 05:04:19	Cracker	right
2016-03-11 05:04:25	@NaughtySquid	EddDeDuck: was about to say i dont see any :P
2016-03-11 05:04:26	Cracker	so you only have dm?
2016-03-11 05:04:36	TomJepp	Samsai: I've always been of the opinion that SS2 starts pretty well but tails off the further you get into it
2016-03-11 05:04:44	psymin	dm is the only multiplayer one as far as I know
2016-03-11 05:04:51	psymin	unless you do .. Synergy?
2016-03-11 05:04:53	@Samsai	TomJepp, it's not that it's a bad game
2016-03-11 05:04:54	Cracker	right
2016-03-11 05:04:57	Cracker	I was going to suggest that
2016-03-11 05:04:59	Cracker	it's pretty fun
2016-03-11 05:05:02	@Samsai	i simply have tough time with all horror games
2016-03-11 05:05:03	Cracker	and works pretty well
2016-03-11 05:05:25	TomJepp	Samsai: I have the memories of playing it when I was far too young to be playing it. ;) it terrified me at the time ;)
2016-03-11 05:05:32	Cracker	Insurgency is always a great choice too if you have some guys wanting to play tactically, but that may be pretty hard in a Lan setting
2016-03-11 05:05:48	TomJepp	TF2 can be fun if you just want to mindlessly bash at each other
2016-03-11 05:05:56	Cracker	and/or Storm United
2016-03-11 05:06:02	qptain_Nemo	a bit of a noob question: does LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. have any effect? or is the working directory automatically included by default?
2016-03-11 05:06:02	Cracker	SS3
2016-03-11 05:06:33	@Samsai	guns of icarus online might be fun in LAN
2016-03-11 05:06:53	gnarface	i like that game
2016-03-11 05:07:00	gnarface	i'm no good but its cool
2016-03-11 05:07:05	psymin	I like it too
2016-03-11 05:07:22	@Samsai	i should play it again
2016-03-11 05:07:34	gnarface	i finally played insurgency
2016-03-11 05:07:34	@Samsai	played a bunch when it launched but then stopped
2016-03-11 05:07:45	@Samsai	had some of the best multiplayer experiences there too
2016-03-11 05:08:43	gnarface	insurgency is pretty fun, the engine is a little wonky though.  to get decent framerates, i have to change an anti-aliasing setting after the game starts, which causes a video refresh.  it doesn't seem to matter what i set the AA to though
2016-03-11 05:09:25	gnarface	guns of icarus is truly inspired though
2016-03-11 05:09:39	gnarface	i like that its like team fortress only its a flying ship
2016-03-11 05:10:18	@Samsai	it's like skyrim with guns
2016-03-11 05:10:23	@Samsai	:P
2016-03-11 05:10:43	@Samsai	but yeah, guns of icarus online is awesome
2016-03-11 05:10:52	gnarface	for the most part the actual guns are sufficiently satisfying

2016-03-11 05:11:04	@Samsai	and quite varied
2016-03-11 05:11:49	@Samsai	it does require playing as a team though and the captain should know his shit
2016-03-11 05:12:23	@Samsai	lack of communication and strategy results in a quick death
2016-03-11 05:12:33	gnarface	for sure
2016-03-11 05:13:23	gnarface	i guess i like that about it
2016-03-11 05:13:35	gnarface	there's no way to win alone
2016-03-11 05:13:50	@Samsai	the problem with it is that bad players can be a major PITA
2016-03-11 05:14:15	psymin	very very true
2016-03-11 05:14:22	gnarface	yes but i found it interesting that (at least in the low-rank matches) if you're a decent captain, nobody will try to stop you
2016-03-11 05:14:41	gnarface	i found that to be oddly different from most games where everyone is constantly scrabbling for the lead
2016-03-11 05:15:07	@Samsai	guns of icarus establishes a command hierarchy from the get-go
2016-03-11 05:15:15	@Samsai	the captain is the captain
2016-03-11 05:15:51	@Samsai	you can't really take the captain's role as another class
2016-03-11 05:16:23	gnarface	well yes, but i mean then generally you maintain your group into the next round
2016-03-11 05:16:25	gnarface	they just stick with you
2016-03-11 05:20:59	mirv_	CoH2 is on sale
2016-03-11 05:21:46	@NaughtySquid	mirv_: it's worth it
2016-03-11 05:22:42	mirv_	and Dawn of War II
2016-03-11 05:22:55	mirv_	but then it's on sale every other weekend
2016-03-11 05:23:38	mirv_	couldn't seem to get into CoH2 myself during a free weekend, but it's an excellent title to test drivers against
2016-03-11 05:23:46	@Samsai	after playing the multi last week i am inclined to agree with NaughtySquid's diagnosis
2016-03-11 05:24:16	hidekin_	the performances of coh2 are a lot better than when it was released
2016-03-11 05:24:16	mirv_	multiplayer might be better, but I don't really have much chance to do that anymore
2016-03-11 05:24:38	@Samsai	i wonder if the SP is as crashy as it was last time
2016-03-11 05:24:47	mirv_	anyone know of a way to re-purchase a game, btw?
2016-03-11 05:24:57	qptain_Nemo	mirv_: on steam?
2016-03-11 05:25:02	mirv_	I have the original dawn of war stuck in german, steam won't allow me to repurchase
2016-03-11 05:25:10	qptain_Nemo	mirv_: you can delete any game from your library
2016-03-11 05:25:18	hidekin_	now you can remove the game for you library

2016-03-11 05:55:27	mirv_	hrmm, I'll try again then

2016-03-11 09:41:55	Sik	Stupid question
2016-03-11 09:42:08	Sik	When I insert a SD card to the computer, what device name should it have?
2016-03-11 09:42:16	Sik	/dev/sdb or what?
2016-03-11 09:42:29	Sik	(there's one hard disk)
2016-03-11 09:44:23	@Samsai	on my systems they read as /dev/mmcblk0
2016-03-11 09:48:05	gnarface	i have a cheap chineese multi-flash usb adapter dongle that supports sd/sdhc and it would show up as /dev/sdb
2016-03-11 09:48:34	gnarface	i have an old dell which has built-in multi-flash slot types
2016-03-11 09:48:35	 < 	Farmboy0 (eho@p5B2B1489.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-03-11 09:48:43	gnarface	it would also show up as /dev/sdb
2016-03-11 09:49:08	gnarface	on the raspberry pi though i think its /dev/mmcblk0 or something very like it
2016-03-11 09:49:32	gnarface	probably depends on the type of host device or something like that?
2016-03-11 09:49:50	gnarface	its all down to a udev config anyway
2016-03-11 09:50:08	gnarface	so in theory it could vary by distro too i guess
2016-03-11 09:50:24	gnarface	and kernel version, of course
2016-03-11 09:51:27	gnarface	actually scratch that i think the dell is actually /dev/sde or /dev/sdf actually
2016-03-11 09:51:51	gnarface	the dell is weird in that the letters are fixed to specific ports
2016-03-11 09:53:07	gnarface	whereas on the chineese adapter either i think they are assigned in the order you plug something into them
2016-03-11 09:53:15	gnarface	which is weird because they all show up even if you don't

2016-03-11 10:06:59	Sik	It still refuses to show up
2016-03-11 10:07:06	Sik	I guess the SD card is dead for good
2016-03-11 10:07:28	Sik	And the only /dev/sd* device is /dev/sda (i.e. the hard disk)
2016-03-11 10:07:42	Sik	...what's /dev/sg0? (and sg1)
2016-03-11 10:08:00	@Samsai	Sik, here's a trick to try: leave the SD card in your computer and reboot
2016-03-11 10:08:12	@Samsai	then see if the device appears
2016-03-11 10:08:25	Sik	Huh... I guess I'll check that later :/ though normally the SD card gets autodetected
2016-03-11 10:08:36	Sik	The card stopped working on the phone suddenly

2016-03-11 10:13:32	Sik	And sg0 is the hard disk
2016-03-11 10:13:37	gnarface	makes sense
2016-03-11 10:13:39	Sik	Argh they're just repeats >_>
2016-03-11 10:13:54	gnarface	i'd check dmesg for errors when its plugged in
2016-03-11 10:14:49	gnarface	i figured /dev/sr0 was your hard disk because i have one too.  i don't have an optical drive though, and don't have /dev/sr1 so i figured there was a chance it was the sd card
2016-03-11 10:15:36	gnarface	but i'd expect dmesg to show errors if the thing was actually faulty
2016-03-11 10:16:12	gnarface	(if you're not sure what is what, just diff the output of dmesg before and after hotplugging it)

2016-03-11 19:02:54	Kallestofeles	How's it going? Had the morning coffee yet?
2016-03-11 19:03:03	Ysblokje	Jup
2016-03-11 19:03:11	Ysblokje	And its going fine
2016-03-11 19:03:19	Ysblokje	bit groggy for some reason
2016-03-11 19:03:35	Ysblokje	having a fight with the MSVC compilers
2016-03-11 19:03:55	Kallestofeles	Give 'em hell. :D
2016-03-11 19:03:59	Ysblokje	I always do
2016-03-11 19:04:07	Ysblokje	THEY WILL COMPLY
2016-03-11 19:04:24	Ysblokje	If my software compiles with gcc and clang its perfect
2016-03-11 19:04:32	Ysblokje	(and it does)
2016-03-11 19:05:37	Kallestofeles	^^
2016-03-11 19:05:58	Kallestofeles	Btw, if that's no secret - then what's the soft you're working on?
2016-03-11 19:07:10	Ysblokje	I work in the beautiful world of alarm central stations
2016-03-11 19:07:49	Ysblokje	The place were burglary alarms and stuff sends their messages to
2016-03-11 19:08:48	Ysblokje	I'm the person that ported the unix stuff to linux (byebye SCO) and is porting stuff to and from windows
2016-03-11 19:09:46	Ysblokje	Lately i've been putting stuff that was too close to the DB behind interfaces , so we can get rid of the POS within a couple of years
2016-03-11 19:11:48	Kallestofeles	Oh nice.
2016-03-11 19:13:13	Ysblokje	Its a weird workfield
2016-03-11 19:13:35	Ysblokje	But it keeps things interesting

2016-03-11 19:22:18	EddDeDuck	that does sound pretty cool
2016-03-11 19:22:42	EddDeDuck	Closest I got to alarms is the work I have done with Zwave and my home automation :)
2016-03-11 19:22:51	Cheeseness	For anybody interested in Overload (new Descent-like game from the original Descent developers), there are 7 hours left and it looks like a pretty safe bet at this point https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revivalprod/overload-the-ultimate-six-degree-of-freedom-shoote
2016-03-11 19:22:51	GolBot	[ OVERLOAD - The Ultimate Six-Degree-of-Freedom Shooter by Revival Productions — Kickstarter ]
2016-03-11 19:22:55	EddDeDuck	And that is more work in progress than anything else :)
2016-03-11 19:25:40	Ysblokje	Well with the whole IOT stuff a lot can be done with private means. But insurance companies will never accept it.
2016-03-11 19:26:47	Nothing_Much	microsoft is still bad
2016-03-11 19:26:58	Ysblokje	Nothing_Much, they will stay that way
2016-03-11 19:27:30	Nothing_Much	no kidding, just tired of hearing about server side garbage that makes money for companies
2016-03-11 19:28:00	Nothing_Much	idgaf about the servers, I don't have one, I want something that benefits the desktop side of Linux, such as better drivers from AMD and Intel

2016-03-13 00:17:05	Raven67854	All factions can produce yellow in some form. so that's balanced

2016-03-13 05:40:49	redje	hmm paradox and obsidian are going to announce something new 15 march
2016-03-13 05:41:01	frostwork	yay
2016-03-13 05:41:07	redje	im curious what's it going to be
2016-03-13 05:41:44	ephja	tibia 2?
2016-03-13 05:41:59	baizon	Star Wars KotOR 3 :D
2016-03-13 05:42:53	redje	think all recent paradox games support linux ^^
2016-03-13 05:46:49	redje	stellaris and heart of iron IV both get day1 support
2016-03-13 05:47:42	frostwork	or paradox just bought bethesda :}
2016-03-13 05:48:27	BTRE	Bethesda is an order of magnitude bigger than Paradox.
2016-03-13 05:48:37	redje	yeah :(
2016-03-13 05:48:42	frostwork	oh really?...
2016-03-13 05:49:41	BTRE	PDS (the dev part) has probably less than 100 employees spread among various projects (HoI, EU, CK, etc) - the individual teams tend to be less than 10 people.
2016-03-13 05:50:08	BTRE	And Paradox, the publisher, only has a few partners.
2016-03-13 05:50:19	redje	Europa Universalis IV is 1 of my favorite games
2016-03-13 05:52:29	redje	when i switched to linux about 2 years ago I had much better performance with eu4 compared to windows

2016-03-13 05:53:21	BTRE	Hm, their engine has a few issues with performance. It usually doesn't scale well to end game situations.
2016-03-13 05:53:38	BTRE	But, yeah, it runs about as well (or bad depending on your perspective) as windows on a whole I think.
2016-03-13 05:54:45	redje	the gamespeed itself was much faster compared to on windows, the game slows down the longer your in the game
2016-03-13 05:54:55	Fenix2412	Hello
2016-03-13 05:55:20	redje	so its very nice if the slowdown isn't as bad

2016-03-13 06:32:26	frankyboy_	gameplaywise... maybe it is only in start of game, and then it will be more complex and fun
2016-03-13 06:32:39	*	Ysblokje is somewhat afraid to start a 3rd one for racing ....
2016-03-13 06:32:54	gnarface	frankyboy_: its more fun if you play with people instead of NPC characters
2016-03-13 06:33:11	BTRE	frankyboy_, I reviewed it for GOL when it first came out. Not a very good game, overall.
2016-03-13 06:33:49	BTRE	May have improved since launch, but I doubt it. Had problems with its core design philosophy.
2016-03-13 06:33:58	frankyboy_	hehe, everygame is better if you play with human chummers :D
2016-03-13 06:34:06	stqn	Ysblokje: if the racing one is on trackmania I’ll participate
2016-03-13 06:34:25	Ysblokje	trackmania on linux? that would be sweeeeeeeeet
2016-03-13 06:34:39	Ysblokje	haven't played in years , but I remember that it was fun
2016-03-13 06:34:49	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: just about to eat dinner
2016-03-13 06:34:50	stqn	yeah, won’t happen anytime soon though… The next one is published by Ubisoft and requires Uplay.
2016-03-13 06:34:53	@NaughtySquid	then we shall Civ V it up
2016-03-13 06:35:21	Ysblokje	grow home also by ubi though...
2016-03-13 06:35:28	stqn	Ysblokje: trackmania nations / united works well under wine
2016-03-13 06:35:31	stqn	hm
2016-03-13 06:35:52	stqn	but Nadeo has always loved DRM and hated players
2016-03-13 06:35:59	Ysblokje	but its running on the unity engine
2016-03-13 06:36:19	@NaughtySquid	i remember the older trackmania
2016-03-13 06:36:24	@NaughtySquid	trying that under wine years ago

2016-03-13 07:00:27	BTRE	and iirc if there's a dlc problem it tells you as much when they try to join

2016-03-13 07:39:20	gnarface	Marezz: i'm sorry man.  did you give it a dignified burial?
2016-03-13 07:39:30	Marezz	i havent yet
2016-03-13 07:39:38	Marezz	im still hoping i can revive it
2016-03-13 07:40:02	kkit	are you baking it in the oven
2016-03-13 07:40:17	gnarface	Marezz: start by pulling the cpu and remounting it with proper thermal paste (minimal) application style?
2016-03-13 07:40:27	gnarface	Marezz: not cpu i mean *gpu heatsync*
2016-03-13 07:40:29	Marezz	im not sure if thats wise, maybe better to "reflow it" ? ;D
2016-03-13 07:41:07	Marezz	gnarface, done that, i get new paste applied
2016-03-13 07:41:12	Marezz	got*

2016-03-13 07:42:05	Marezz	i have read about gpu malfunctions, it appears that mine has faulty vram judging by the symptoms

2016-03-13 07:43:48	Marezz	granted it is slow by todays standard but its working like the first day

2016-03-13 09:39:58	stqn	hi fox
2016-03-13 09:40:11	fox	I was thinking what more can we all do to get people on Linux
2016-03-13 09:40:25	stqn	kill all the windows users
2016-03-13 09:40:42	fox	stqn, No I'm being real here what can we do
2016-03-13 09:40:49	stqn	you can’t
2016-03-13 09:41:03	fox	stqn, I build Linux systems now and push it on my customers
2016-03-13 09:41:15	fox	Has to be more we can do
2016-03-13 09:41:21	stqn	oh, right, it’s you. I remember the red business PC. :p
2016-03-13 09:41:26	ephja	well if it works :)
2016-03-13 09:41:55	fox	I was thinking of doing a ad on my local news about Linux

2016-03-13 09:42:13	qptain_Nemo	fox: well i intend to make games... :V
2016-03-13 09:42:33	ephja	yeah, most people just don't care. progress is being made though, despite a big market share
2016-03-13 09:42:38	stqn	you can get kids to use linux
2016-03-13 09:42:45	stqn	and then they’ll know it
2016-03-13 09:42:49	stqn	and not fear it
2016-03-13 09:43:00	fox	stqn, I'm going to schools soon to do just that
2016-03-13 09:43:18	ephja	great
2016-03-13 09:44:46	fox	The customers I've moved over to Linux have been very happy
2016-03-13 09:45:38	fox	The last business system we installed has even been doing great
2016-03-13 09:46:41	stqn	of course, linux is better than windows… except you don’t have all the games, all the software, and your neighboor uses windows so he can’t help you. So it’s a hard sell for many people.

2016-03-13 09:55:03	gnarface	Marezz: there's an index= option for most the audio modules.  you pass it to all of them to specify what order they load
2016-03-13 09:55:45	Marezz	gnarface, how do i do that? sorry im clueless xD
2016-03-13 09:56:45	gnarface	Marezz: on debian you'd add lines to /etc/modprobe.d/options.conf or something like that

2016-03-13 10:10:36	Raven67854	stqn, gaming keyboards work fine. But for gaming mouse Roccat has a linux driver which is nice
2016-03-13 10:10:53	Raven67854	It's supported by one person but he gets all of their hardware from them and they don't impede him. he even gets the hardware early :D
2016-03-13 10:11:09	stqn	I know, I had problems with the software and the driver actually
2016-03-13 10:11:15	stqn	but the driver wasn’t needed
2016-03-13 10:12:21	Raven67854	I think its apart of the kernel =/
2016-03-13 10:12:30	Raven67854	well kernel driver bits
2016-03-13 10:13:07	stqn	well maybe driver isn’t the correct term, it may have been something to handle macros or whatnot
2016-03-13 10:13:27	Raven67854	Oh that panel?
2016-03-13 10:13:29	Raven67854	It works sometimes
2016-03-13 10:13:35	Raven67854	but once you set the macro it works at least :D

2016-03-13 10:58:33	gnarface	whatever i did seems to have worked for mumble and arecord but not teamspeak
2016-03-13 10:58:43	gnarface	i wonder why
2016-03-13 10:58:46	BTRE	mmm, weird
2016-03-13 11:01:08	gnarface	its hard to diagnose just from other people's descriptions, because i also have a problem with fan noise in this room and i'm not always sure which issue is being complained about

2016-03-13 13:23:55	dabblers-buffet	Hey guys.
2016-03-13 13:24:03	dabblers-buffet	How's everybody doing?
2016-03-13 13:29:02	dabblers-buffet	Does anybody know about the image format .BMP?
2016-03-13 13:29:19	dabblers-buffet	Right now, I'm trying to determine what image format I'm using for quality sake.
2016-03-13 13:29:29	dabblers-buffet	I seem to get great results with .PNG
2016-03-13 13:29:49	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: BMP is uncompressed
2016-03-13 13:29:56	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: use PNG wherever possible
2016-03-13 13:30:07	dabblers-buffet	PNG is best here.
2016-03-13 13:30:14	dabblers-buffet	I haven't seen a replacement yet.
2016-03-13 13:30:33	dabblers-buffet	Even for channel art on YouTube, I refuse to upload something in a .JPEG format.
2016-03-13 13:30:35	dabblers-buffet	Any picture.
2016-03-13 13:30:35	gnarface	there isn't really, with just RGB color. its the best
2016-03-13 13:31:09	dabblers-buffet	By default, a JPEG picture looks best when it's not edited at all.
2016-03-13 13:31:11	dabblers-buffet	Or rarely.
2016-03-13 13:31:31	dabblers-buffet	But when you re-edit it over & over, over time the picture quality degrades.
2016-03-13 13:31:46	dabblers-buffet	I think BMP is old, isn't it?
2016-03-13 13:31:54	 < 	Corben78 (~corben@unaffiliated/corben78) has quit (Quit: Quit)
2016-03-13 13:32:00	dabblers-buffet	Does that date back to the beginning of Windows?
2016-03-13 13:32:10	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: BMP is very old, maybe older than windows
2016-03-13 13:33:33	Raven67854	Don't think youtube accepts bitmaps for channel art anyway
2016-03-13 13:33:48	dabblers-buffet	Did you know that the PNG file format supports eight-bit paletted images (with optional transparency for all palette colors) and 24-bit truecolor (16 million colors) or 48-bit truecolor with and without alpha channel"
2016-03-13 13:33:54	dabblers-buffet	That's what the wiki says about that.
2016-03-13 13:34:11	Raven67854	Just use PNG
2016-03-13 13:34:18	dabblers-buffet	24-bit is pretty good but 48?, Wow, that's very good.
2016-03-13 13:34:23	dabblers-buffet	Do you guys use PNG all the time?
2016-03-13 13:34:26	Raven67854	Yes
2016-03-13 13:34:34	dabblers-buffet	Who goes with JPEG then?
2016-03-13 13:34:35	Raven67854	Not for games though
2016-03-13 13:34:46	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: yes, i knew all about that.  i use PNG and JPEG both regularly
2016-03-13 13:35:08	dabblers-buffet	I'd use GIFs for animations, of course. :)
2016-03-13 13:35:13	Raven67854	to be honest even jpg would be fine since you don't have alpha anyway
2016-03-13 13:35:22	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: JPEG is lossy unlike PNG, but sometimes looks close enough but saves a lot of space
2016-03-13 13:35:24	Raven67854	Hell I wouldn't be surprised if youtube doesn't convert the channel art to JPG :P
2016-03-13 13:35:35	dabblers-buffet	Does YouTube do that?
2016-03-13 13:35:40	Raven67854	No idea
2016-03-13 13:35:50	Raven67854	I don't really care if they do or don't because it looks fine anyway
2016-03-13 13:35:58	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: in general JPEG does better with photographic images, while PNG does better with stuff that was digitally generated
2016-03-13 13:36:11	dabblers-buffet	Oh I see.
2016-03-13 13:36:13	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: *hand generated, digitally, i mean
2016-03-13 13:36:18	gnarface	like flat colors
2016-03-13 13:36:20	dabblers-buffet	My camera takes JPEG pictures.
2016-03-13 13:36:21	gnarface	cartoons
2016-03-13 13:36:52	dabblers-buffet	You're right gnarface, PNG does better when it's hand generated.
2016-03-13 13:36:54	gnarface	yes its very uncommon for digital cameras NOT to take JPEG pictures
2016-03-13 13:37:10	gnarface	JPEG was created specifically to store photography
2016-03-13 13:37:16	dabblers-buffet	What's the TIFF format used for? Print?
2016-03-13 13:37:27	dabblers-buffet	That's lossless as well.
2016-03-13 13:37:29	gnarface	mostly.  just think of it as a BMP with layers
2016-03-13 13:37:46	dabblers-buffet	Ugh, Ok, well that won't fit, I'm definitely sticking with .PNG.
2016-03-13 13:37:50	gnarface	BMP is a very primitive image format, TIFF has some extra features
2016-03-13 13:38:06	dabblers-buffet	Speaking of that, could I show you guys my channel avatar on YouTube?
2016-03-13 13:38:11	dabblers-buffet	I'd like to see what you guys think.
2016-03-13 13:38:16	gnarface	but yea, nobody uses TIFF in production really.  its more commonly used as a medium for working with images, then when you're finished, you export to PNG or JPEG typically
2016-03-13 13:38:37	dabblers-buffet	I got it for dabblers buffet, I have to work on the channel banner however.

2016-03-13 13:40:46	dabblers-buffet	This is it, right here.
2016-03-13 13:41:00	dabblers-buffet	Although, I have another picture where the text is a little closer to each other.
2016-03-13 13:42:04	gnarface	ooh, laser lensflare.  reminds me of the 90's
2016-03-13 13:43:10	dabblers-buffet	Actually, you know what I did?
2016-03-13 13:43:22	gnarface	?
2016-03-13 13:43:22	dabblers-buffet	That rainbow effect was from the Supernova effect from GIMP. :D
2016-03-13 13:43:39	gnarface	ah
2016-03-13 13:43:40	dabblers-buffet	My dad was showing me something about that effect & he accidentally made that rainbow effect.
2016-03-13 13:43:46	dabblers-buffet	XD
2016-03-13 13:43:51	dabblers-buffet	So it was discovered by mistake.
2016-03-13 13:44:24	dabblers-buffet	How does the text look?
2016-03-13 13:44:28	dabblers-buffet	I think it looks fine as it is.
2016-03-13 13:44:39	dabblers-buffet	I don't think it has to be moved at all.
2016-03-13 13:45:08	gnarface	eh, i'm not really qualified to comment on artistic matters
2016-03-13 13:45:38	dabblers-buffet	I think it looks good on my channel.
2016-03-13 13:46:06	dabblers-buffet	That rainbow means since my channel is a variety channel, there are different colors (subjects) on the channel.
2016-03-13 13:46:16	dabblers-buffet	But it looks cool as well.
2016-03-13 13:46:25	dabblers-buffet	Looks better than a rainbow spectrum gradient.
2016-03-13 13:46:34	dabblers-buffet	That would've been weird.
2016-03-13 13:46:40	dabblers-buffet	I'm getting the hang of GIMP.
2016-03-13 13:46:45	dabblers-buffet	So far, it is great.
2016-03-13 13:46:53	dabblers-buffet	Experimenting around with different effects.
2016-03-13 13:47:19	gnarface	you can add your own too
2016-03-13 13:47:49	dabblers-buffet	Add my own?
2016-03-13 13:47:54	dabblers-buffet	Besides the preset effects?
2016-03-13 13:48:10	gnarface	yea there's plugin interfaces
2016-03-13 13:48:18	gnarface	in more than one scripting language, i think
2016-03-13 13:48:30	gnarface	perl, and scheme, i think?
2016-03-13 13:48:38	dabblers-buffet	That sounds a little complex.
2016-03-13 13:48:40	gnarface	maybe also python?
2016-03-13 13:48:44	dabblers-buffet	I like the preset effects as they are.
2016-03-13 13:48:45	Raven67854	python too
2016-03-13 13:48:55	gnarface	you'd need a little programming knowledge
2016-03-13 13:49:06	Raven67854	Whats this channel for dabblers-buffet?
2016-03-13 13:49:09	gnarface	but it'd be a good beginner's task to learn a little programming
2016-03-13 13:49:35	dabblers-buffet	This channel is for entertainment's sake.
2016-03-13 13:49:47	Raven67854	What kind of content?
2016-03-13 13:49:48	dabblers-buffet	As well as maybe trying to do my best into getting popular on youtube.
2016-03-13 13:49:56	dabblers-buffet	Although that'd take a lot of time.

2016-03-13 13:51:16	dabblers-buffet	So I'll be doing some gaming on linux as well.
2016-03-13 13:51:25	dabblers-buffet	And more stuff like N64 gameplay, PS2, etc...
2016-03-13 13:51:36	dabblers-buffet	That's why it's called dabbler's buffet.
2016-03-13 13:51:57	dabblers-buffet	Dabbling in something & then there's the buffet of things to dabble in.
2016-03-13 13:51:58	Mneuro	Is anyone using Ubuntu with Unity?

2016-03-13 13:59:51	gnarface	ubuntu isn't materially better
2016-03-13 14:00:20	Raven67854	Mneuro, Uhm what? That's weird.. what game specifically I probably have it and can check see if I get that
2016-03-13 14:00:22	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: debian is know for being secure
2016-03-13 14:00:26	Mneuro	Raven67854, CSGO
2016-03-13 14:00:29	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: *debian stable only*
2016-03-13 14:00:30	Mneuro	or Dota 2
2016-03-13 14:00:43	Raven67854	gnarface, Pretty much all distro's that believe in patching security bugs are secure
2016-03-13 14:00:48	Mneuro	enabled borderless Fullscreen and the launcher shows over top of it
2016-03-13 14:01:01	Raven67854	By any chance Mneuro do you keep the launcher hidden?
2016-03-13 14:01:15	Mneuro	If i enable hide launcher, the top bar still shows
2016-03-13 14:01:33	Raven67854	That is strange
2016-03-13 14:01:37	Raven67854	what driver?
2016-03-13 14:01:47	Raven67854	Also Ubuntu version
2016-03-13 14:02:09	Mneuro	I tried both 14.04 and 15.10 and both 352 and 355 driver
2016-03-13 14:02:23	Raven67854	That's really weird
2016-03-13 14:02:32	dabblers-buffet	What else besides Debian?
2016-03-13 14:02:39	dabblers-buffet	Tails?
2016-03-13 14:02:42	Raven67854	dabblers-buffet, Pretty much all of them
2016-03-13 14:02:59	dabblers-buffet	What are you using then for your distro?
2016-03-13 14:03:04	 < 	HACKhalo2 (~HACKhalo2@108-245-125-51.lightspeed.gdrpmi.sbcglobal.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2016-03-13 14:03:06	dabblers-buffet	I mean what distro are you using?
2016-03-13 14:03:10	Raven67854	Mneuro, I know valves been doing a lot of changes to Linux source games. It is possible they've broken something. I know TF2 is broken for people AMD FOSS
2016-03-13 14:03:18	Raven67854	dabblers-buffet, I use Ubuntu 16.04 on desktop and Arch on laptops
2016-03-13 14:03:30	Mneuro	Raven67854, fair enough.  I will probably go back to Xubuntu then.  Never had issues there
2016-03-13 14:03:48	Mneuro	or i guess at this point I could just go back to arch
2016-03-13 14:03:55	Raven67854	Mneuro, Kinda shitty =/. Will you submit it as a bug though please? I'm pretty certain its a valve related issue
2016-03-13 14:04:02	Mneuro	I prefer arch but had some issues, but i guess the same amount of issues I have now on ubuntu
2016-03-13 14:04:18	Raven67854	Is that the only game that does it?
2016-03-13 14:04:32	Mneuro	no, every game that has a fullscreen windowed mode does it
2016-03-13 14:04:37	Raven67854	:(
2016-03-13 14:05:16	dabblers-buffet	Raven67854: I hope Ubuntu is better than what I'm using in terms of security, you don't hate on that.
2016-03-13 14:05:19	dabblers-buffet	Do you?
2016-03-13 14:05:24	Raven67854	Who cares what I hate
2016-03-13 14:05:46	Mneuro	dabblers-buffet,  if you like mint then keep using it.  It definitely has security issues.
2016-03-13 14:05:46	Raven67854	Just saying if you want me to stop saying eww stop using a distro that hates security updates
2016-03-13 14:05:57	Raven67854	Mneuro, I just googled the error and its all valve games =/
2016-03-13 14:06:30	dabblers-buffet	I don't know any other distros that doesn't hate security updates.
2016-03-13 14:06:38	Raven67854	Could still be unity though. I've never experienced it
2016-03-13 14:06:38	dabblers-buffet	So how would I switch?
2016-03-13 14:06:38	Mneuro	All of them
2016-03-13 14:06:41	Raven67854	ALL OF THEM
2016-03-13 14:06:45	Mneuro	Ubuntu, Arch, Opensuse
2016-03-13 14:06:48	Raven67854	jesus fucking christ how many times do I have to say it :D
2016-03-13 14:06:49	Mneuro	Fedora
2016-03-13 14:06:58	dabblers-buffet	OK!
2016-03-13 14:06:59	dabblers-buffet	OK.
2016-03-13 14:07:00	dabblers-buffet	Ok.
2016-03-13 14:07:01	Raven67854	All of them except for Mint and Manjaro :D
2016-03-13 14:07:05	Raven67854	take your bloody pick there's thousands
2016-03-13 14:07:24	dabblers-buffet	I know there's thousands, I just haven't been active that much in trying out distros.
2016-03-13 14:07:32	Raven67854	There's elementary os
2016-03-13 14:07:34	dabblers-buffet	I'll go look for some.
2016-03-13 14:07:39	Raven67854	its based on 14.04.x
2016-03-13 14:07:46	Raven67854	https://elementary.io/
2016-03-13 14:07:47	GolBot	[ Download elementary OS ]
2016-03-13 14:07:51	Raven67854	mac os x clone but it is VERY rock solid
2016-03-13 14:07:54	Raven67854	I will give them that
2016-03-13 14:08:00	dabblers-buffet	I've heard about that one.
2016-03-13 14:08:07	dabblers-buffet	Elementary OS.
2016-03-13 14:08:16	Mneuro	I've been looking at elementary lately
2016-03-13 14:08:33	Mneuro	Raven67854, is Elementary halfway decent?
2016-03-13 14:08:42	dabblers-buffet	Mint and Manjaro hate security updates. :D
2016-03-13 14:08:44	dabblers-buffet	XD
2016-03-13 14:08:49	Raven67854	Mneuro, Yeah if you're okay with 14.04 Ubuntu
2016-03-13 14:08:56	Mneuro	Yea, I prefer LTS distros
2016-03-13 14:09:03	dabblers-buffet	Mneuro: Same here.
2016-03-13 14:09:05	Raven67854	Mneuro, Then yes its rock solid
2016-03-13 14:09:09	dabblers-buffet	They're more stable.
2016-03-13 14:09:14	Mneuro	I'll install it tonight and check it out
2016-03-13 14:09:15	Raven67854	I'm on 16.04 and have no issues
2016-03-13 14:09:22	Raven67854	I can even play CS:GO in borderless

2016-03-13 14:09:56	gnarface	Raven67854: nah
2016-03-13 14:10:16	Mneuro	Raven67854, you are on Ubuntu Unity 16.04?
2016-03-13 14:10:17	Raven67854	Oh =/
2016-03-13 14:10:19	Mneuro	maybe i'll try that
2016-03-13 14:10:20	Raven67854	Mneuro, Yepper
2016-03-13 14:10:28	Raven67854	It's visually just 15.10 atm
2016-03-13 14:10:33	Raven67854	Updates fair bit
2016-03-13 14:10:40	Mneuro	maybe it fixed this bug i've had
2016-03-13 14:10:47	Raven67854	That bug has existed for years
2016-03-13 14:10:52	Raven67854	But I've never actually encountered it
2016-03-13 14:10:55	dabblers-buffet	Hey just wondering about the security updates, is that related to when Linux Mint caught those hacked iso images in February?
2016-03-13 14:10:58	Mneuro	oh okay then i'll switch away
2016-03-13 14:11:01	dabblers-buffet	Because of that?
2016-03-13 14:11:03	Raven67854	dabblers-buffet, No
2016-03-13 14:11:08	Raven67854	Well you know
2016-03-13 14:11:12	Raven67854	They hate security so they use wordpress
2016-03-13 14:11:16	dabblers-buffet	Ok then.
2016-03-13 14:11:19	dabblers-buffet	Wordpress?!
2016-03-13 14:11:21	Raven67854	So I mean yeah maybe philosophy wise maybe :P
2016-03-13 14:11:21	dabblers-buffet	Wow.
2016-03-13 14:11:23	Mneuro	mint holds back kernel updates even if they have security fixes
2016-03-13 14:11:31	Raven67854	Same thing for apps
2016-03-13 14:11:42	Raven67854	or any low level lib
2016-03-13 14:11:47	Raven67854	Bug in openssl? WHO CARES ABOUT PATCHING
2016-03-13 14:11:52	Raven67854	Fuck that shit
2016-03-13 14:11:54	dabblers-buffet	I have 2 things in my Update Manager right now, linux & linux-firmware.
2016-03-13 14:12:11	dabblers-buffet	& yet, that's listed as level 5.
2016-03-13 14:12:24	dabblers-buffet	But those are 2 security updates right there.
2016-03-13 14:12:25	Mneuro	level 5 are not installed by default
2016-03-13 14:12:26	Raven67854	Go to Ubuntu or arch or debian like gnarface
2016-03-13 14:12:28	Raven67854	Pick one!
2016-03-13 14:12:41	dabblers-buffet	I might just go with Xubuntu.
2016-03-13 14:12:45	Raven67854	Cool
2016-03-13 14:12:46	dabblers-buffet	How's that?
2016-03-13 14:12:49	Raven67854	So long as it's Linux
2016-03-13 14:12:50	Raven67854	Good
2016-03-13 14:12:53	dabblers-buffet	I think I'll go with that.
2016-03-13 14:12:55	Raven67854	I find all of Ubuntu's flavors to be pretty good
2016-03-13 14:12:56	Mneuro	Xubuntu is a great distro
2016-03-13 14:12:59	Mneuro	I've used it for years
2016-03-13 14:13:04	dabblers-buffet	Wow Mint, what were you thinking?
2016-03-13 14:13:14	Raven67854	I actually like Unity
2016-03-13 14:13:16	Raven67854	Specially unity 8
2016-03-13 14:13:20	Raven67854	I ran that for awhile on my laptop
2016-03-13 14:13:24	Raven67854	world apart from unity 7
2016-03-13 14:13:31	Mneuro	I prefer unity but this bug is a deal breaker for me :(
2016-03-13 14:13:46	Raven67854	Mneuro, I've honestly  never seen that bug there is a fix for it though
2016-03-13 14:13:57	Mneuro	i tried the CCSM legacy fullscreen fix
2016-03-13 14:13:59	Mneuro	it didn't fix it
2016-03-13 14:14:12	Raven67854	Really?
2016-03-13 14:14:15	Mneuro	yep
2016-03-13 14:14:18	Raven67854	What about set the launcher to auto hide?
2016-03-13 14:14:22	dabblers-buffet	I'm getting Xubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.
2016-03-13 14:14:26	Mneuro	that only hides the launcher, not the top bar
2016-03-13 14:15:02	Raven67854	dabblers-buffet, Cool! Also check out elementary os
2016-03-13 14:15:11	Raven67854	Mneuro, I can't get it to replicate =/
2016-03-13 14:15:13	Raven67854	Do you have civ?
2016-03-13 14:15:29	Mneuro	yes but not installed
2016-03-13 14:15:35	Raven67854	civs borderless window
2016-03-13 14:15:38	Raven67854	does that work?
2016-03-13 14:15:41	dabblers-buffet	I'll check that out as well.
2016-03-13 14:16:28	dabblers-buffet	I wonder if I could do this, get a list of software that I like, put all the applications onto something like a flash drive, & program something to get them to automatically open all software & install by themselves.
2016-03-13 14:16:36	dabblers-buffet	Is that possible to do?
2016-03-13 14:16:58	dabblers-buffet	Like I could just plug in the flash drive, sit back, & let it do its thing.
2016-03-13 14:17:03	Raven67854	ah you know what though. civ auto closes when you tab away.. hmmm
2016-03-13 14:17:44	Raven67854	Ah wait there's factorio!
2016-03-13 14:18:24	Raven67854	Factorio is also fine
2016-03-13 14:19:28	Mneuro	I'm gona try out Elementary
2016-03-13 14:19:36	Mneuro	I love the mac OSX look
2016-03-13 14:19:51	Mneuro	even though I hate Apple, and OSX is a slug, it looks nice
2016-03-13 14:20:06	Raven67854	Mneuro, No minimizing :D

2016-03-14 23:35:32	Ravenholm	Pfft
2016-03-14 23:35:37	Ravenholm	I've been gone about half a year
2016-03-14 23:35:44	Ravenholm	surely I missed something
2016-03-14 23:35:51	Ravenholm	 I see Rocket League is coming
2016-03-14 23:35:56	Ravenholm	That's pretty awesome
2016-03-14 23:36:02	madmachinations	Rocket League is always coming :P
2016-03-14 23:36:11	madmachinations	Sunless sea finally has an official build
2016-03-14 23:36:39	disharmonic	Divinity:OS, American Truck Simulator, Balrum, Factorio. There's probably more
2016-03-14 23:37:11	madmachinations	Xcom2
2016-03-14 23:37:21	madmachinations	when did grid autosport happen? that might have been within 6 months
2016-03-14 23:37:43	disharmonic	madmachinations: 4 months or so i think
2016-03-14 23:37:48	Ravenholm	Oh, XCOM2
2016-03-14 23:37:55	Ravenholm	I hear it's pretty tough
2016-03-14 23:43:16	disharmonic	Yes and no. The difficulty levels off once you've researched most tech and have a lot of Col. level troops. But the final mission is tough
2016-03-14 23:45:09	disharmonic	Now i'm waiting for good overhaul mod. But that might take a few months

2016-03-15 00:22:03	Ravenholm	disharmonic: not sure that's a short?
2016-03-15 00:22:15	Ravenholm	what motherboard is it?
2016-03-15 00:23:50	disharmonic	Asrock Z170 extreme6. Worked fine for 2 moths.
2016-03-15 00:24:21	disharmonic	Ravenholm: The reset button doesn't work when it locks up, so most likely a short

2016-03-15 02:02:29	tumocs	well isn't that a shitty one

2016-03-15 02:02:44	Raven67854	I don't think I've ever had a good indiegala bundle

2016-03-15 02:02:53	Ysblokje	they mostly are afaik
2016-03-15 02:04:05	Raven67854	gkeen_, anyway black desert online has some pretty neat mechanics. Like no fast travel and I like that it's a sandboxish MMO. It has a story and plot. But you're free to do whatever like in eve.
2016-03-15 02:04:45	Raven67854	would be nice if it'd come to Linux but hehe.. Game's originally made by south korean devs. So that'll never happen
2016-03-15 02:05:38	Cracker	ohhh shit
2016-03-15 02:05:45	Cracker	I was thinking it was for Linux
2016-03-15 02:05:52	Raven67854	Why?
2016-03-15 02:06:34	Cracker	Why would I not think that when we are discussing it in #gamingonlinux?

2016-03-15 02:08:06	Raven67854	I wonder if it works in wine
2016-03-15 02:08:36	Ysblokje	There was talk of dx11 in wine but it wasnt good talk
2016-03-15 02:08:38	Cracker	That's a shame too, the game looks pretty good
2016-03-15 02:08:42	Cracker	but ohhh well
2016-03-15 02:08:57	Raven67854	It's different than most MMO's
2016-03-15 02:09:09	Raven67854	I don't know how long it'll last in the NA/EU region though
2016-03-15 02:09:26	Ysblokje	but no fasttravel, that kinda makes it a walking simulator :D
2016-03-15 02:09:32	Cracker	The only game that has really challenged my Linux only gaming stance is The Division
2016-03-15 02:09:51	gkeen_	Cracker: get a ps4
2016-03-15 02:09:56	Raven67854	Cracker, have that on PS4 it's pretty fun.. Took me almost a week of non stop playing to get to max level
2016-03-15 02:09:59	Raven67854	Now to get better gear
2016-03-15 02:10:00	Cracker	pft
2016-03-15 02:10:15	Cracker	I have no interest in a console
2016-03-15 02:10:21	Cracker	but thanks for the suggestion
2016-03-15 02:10:52	Cracker	I can't stand playing FPS's with a gamepad
2016-03-15 02:10:58	Raven67854	It's not an FPS
2016-03-15 02:11:01	Cracker	it dumbs it down way too much

2016-03-15 03:09:57	@Samsai	Kyrottimus, i can relay that to liam
2016-03-15 03:10:05	Kyrottimus	cool
2016-03-15 03:10:52	Kyrottimus	so it seems the Mordhau devs, like a lot of smaller indie devs, linux support depends on how easy the engine makes it for them :P
2016-03-15 03:11:04	Kyrottimus	with the Mordhau devs*
2016-03-15 03:11:58	@Samsai	the smaller the team the less time they have for making engine-level tweaks
2016-03-15 03:12:37	Kyrottimus	I presume UE4 isn't that hard, though, as the Descent Underground team isn't THAT big and they've had (pretty much) day-1 Linux build...

2016-03-15 03:13:36	Kyrottimus	I think out of principle, if you're developing a game to use linux as your primary server OS, you're a dick to not at least make a working linux port
2016-03-15 03:14:11	Kyrottimus	yeah
2016-03-15 03:15:02	Kyrottimus	Sorta like me installing new light-fixtures.  At first I thought to myself, "I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm going to screw this up" and after spending 5 minutes looking into how it's done, I was all, "oh, ok this is easy"

2016-03-15 03:24:26	frostwork	they are still busy porting older titles, so therer's still hope imho
2016-03-15 03:25:28	stqn	for people who just want to make money making games and are not linux users already, it makes perfect sense to ignore linux right now… although some (like Positech) still have linux ports made. I believe he’s making money out of them even though he pays someone to port his directx code every time…
2016-03-15 03:25:45	dis_	frostwork: Well past replies regarding those 2 games were not too positive
2016-03-15 03:26:32	frostwork	dis_, oh didn't know that :(
2016-03-15 03:26:43	Kyrottimus	well I personally know a lot of non-gamer types who, after their windows 7/8 update center did the 60 minute update-to-windoze10 while their PC was idle, got stuck on 10, hate it, and are asking me to install Mint on their boxes xD

2016-03-15 03:28:28	stqn	I wonder, does mint delete old kernels? (unlike ubuntu)
2016-03-15 03:28:40	Kyrottimus	nope, you can manually do that if you wish

2016-03-15 03:29:01	Kyrottimus	yeah, but it doesn't automatically install kernels either
2016-03-15 03:29:08	Kyrottimus	it's up to you to install/uninstall kernels
2016-03-15 03:29:17	Kyrottimus	but it has a gui for that for newer users
2016-03-15 03:29:22	Kyrottimus	built right into their update center
2016-03-15 03:29:47	@Samsai	indeed, mint has innovated a perfection solution for kernel clutter
2016-03-15 03:30:19	Kyrottimus	and they don't have questional privacy issues, as has  Cononical

2016-03-15 03:31:05	Kyrottimus	so mine is working (less than) below avg
2016-03-15 03:32:24	stqn	I really don't understand why canonical has done nothing about the old kernels… it's not that hard to delete kernels that haven’t been booted in 2 months or something like that
2016-03-15 03:32:53	dis_	arnej: True but those are all on the recently ported engine they use for the adventure games. Blackguards uses something else. Well, in any case, hopefully you're right
2016-03-15 03:33:01	@Samsai	it's also not that hard to run apt-get autoremove every once in a while
2016-03-15 03:33:09	Kyrottimus	for me, Mint is just cleaner, more straightforward, more intuitive

2016-03-15 06:11:35	NoirLess	seriosly - we need some exclusives, Imo

2016-03-15 06:11:57	AciD`	also, Path of exile just because

2016-03-15 06:12:43	AciD`	why does it sucks?
2016-03-15 06:13:03	NoirLess	I meant, no exclusives = sux
2016-03-15 06:13:11	AciD`	:|
2016-03-15 06:13:23	AciD`	you do know this chan is about PC games, not console games? :)
2016-03-15 06:13:30	NoirLess	If I ll make diablo killer, 1st part will be for all platforms to turn people into fans, and second only for linux and macs
2016-03-15 06:13:32	NoirLess	>:D
2016-03-15 06:13:34	AciD`	and moreover, not the windows store games? :)
2016-03-15 06:13:44	NoirLess	>console games
2016-03-15 06:13:49	NoirLess	but wait
2016-03-15 06:13:55	NoirLess	consoles has NO GAMES
2016-03-15 06:13:58	NoirLess	:D
2016-03-15 06:14:05	AciD`	I understand your train of though, also I don't agree about doing exclusive at all
2016-03-15 06:14:25	NoirLess	actually exclusive, at my point, isnt clearly exclusive
2016-03-15 06:14:26	qptain_Nemo	i'm super on the fence about exclusives
2016-03-15 06:14:27	AciD`	Linux should "win the desktop" another way that doing shady stuff proprietary software do
2016-03-15 06:14:42	NoirLess	just like "release smthin for some platforms earlier, than for other"
2016-03-15 06:14:48	 < 	seyt (~r00ted@unaffiliated/seyt) has quit (Client Quit)
2016-03-15 06:14:54	AciD`	that, hm
2016-03-15 06:15:20	qptain_Nemo	another example would be an early access game that is linux-only during early access
2016-03-15 06:15:29	qptain_Nemo	that would be totally fair game imo
2016-03-15 06:15:41	NoirLess	also - if microsoft will force their games for windows live 2.0 as only store for games and make launchin stuff outside of it impossible, non-windows exclusives will become real
2016-03-15 06:15:52	AciD`	as I said, I do understand the need to 'hey, want to play that awesome stuff, come use Linux then. Then after a few week the user would thing, "oh, I though using Linux was hard, it's not, yeah, I'll stay on this OS and spread the love"
2016-03-15 06:16:03	NoirLess	qptain_Nemo, actually, as I said
2016-03-15 06:16:19	NoirLess	best thing is make awesome shit, to make people enjoy it and scream "MOAR"
2016-03-15 06:16:35	NoirLess	and then make sequel, avalaible only for few platforms
2016-03-15 06:16:40	NoirLess	and... profit!
2016-03-15 06:16:46	NoirLess	microsoft did it already
2016-03-15 06:16:48	NoirLess	why not?
2016-03-15 06:16:58	NoirLess	and sony with ps
2016-03-15 06:17:05	AciD`	to be honest
2016-03-15 06:17:06	NoirLess	and... I can remember thousand examples
2016-03-15 06:17:20	NoirLess	obliviosly most console exclusives moves to pc later
2016-03-15 06:17:33	AciD`	I really, really don't get why developpers would choose microsoft over linux
2016-03-15 06:17:36	AciD`	for anything
2016-03-15 06:17:36	NoirLess	but 1st half/one/two years, they are exclusives
2016-03-15 06:17:46	AciD`	it has always puzzled me
2016-03-15 06:17:47	NoirLess	AciD`, cuz its popular
2016-03-15 06:17:56	NoirLess	it forces everywhere, its preinstalled
2016-03-15 06:18:02	AciD`	except if they only target profit, and not 'it's fun to code'
2016-03-15 06:18:27	josefnpat	I think it's mostly because it's "what they're used to"
2016-03-15 06:18:32	NoirLess	just like "why everyone masturbates on iphones, ever if they have only 1gb ram"
2016-03-15 06:18:38	josefnpat	msft basically gives it's software away fro free at schools and the such
2016-03-15 06:18:45	josefnpat	and people become accustomed to it and nothing else
2016-03-15 06:18:54	AciD`	josefnpat -> "what they are used to" does not fit the dev profile
2016-03-15 06:19:05	josefnpat	sure it does - I went to a tech shool
2016-03-15 06:19:05	AciD`	which by definition should learn new stuff every single day
2016-03-15 06:19:05	NoirLess	also windows is preinstalled on most pcs/laptops
2016-03-15 06:19:12	AciD`	and hence should have at least tried linux once
2016-03-15 06:19:13	josefnpat	once they get out of school, either the software comes with the computer or they get it from work
2016-03-15 06:19:17	NoirLess	cuz, if someone isnt geek, he will buy finished pc
2016-03-15 06:19:21	AciD`	and hence should have ditch windows
2016-03-15 06:19:23	NoirLess	not make it himself
2016-03-15 06:19:37	NoirLess	>ditch windows
2016-03-15 06:19:38	NoirLess	:D
2016-03-15 06:19:48	josefnpat	AciD`: you'll find many engineers aren't as experiemental as you and I
2016-03-15 06:19:52	NoirLess	it sounds ever funnier on my launguage
2016-03-15 06:19:53	NoirLess	:D
2016-03-15 06:20:12	AciD`	NoirLess -> which is?
2016-03-15 06:20:56	NoirLess	sadly I cant translate correctly - its language-joke, based on how it sounds and one forced meme
2016-03-15 06:20:59	AciD`	josefnpat -> I refuse to believe that even a "low level engineer" can't see the huge benefit of Linux/BSD over a proprietary shit like windows (pardon my French)
2016-03-15 06:21:20	josefnpat	AciD`: they don't because they don't care to experiement out of their comfort zone
2016-03-15 06:21:35	AciD`	ah, lazy ass biatch!
2016-03-15 06:21:37	josefnpat	yeah
2016-03-15 06:21:38	josefnpat	haha
2016-03-15 06:21:45	NoirLess	actually, some stuff is still exclusive for proprietary platforms
2016-03-15 06:21:57	NoirLess	such as music editors (cubase/fl/etc)

2016-03-15 06:23:16	josefnpat	AciD`: linux is a different workflow - for folks who are used to a "way of doing it", it becaomse almost painful to use different software. (e.g. Photoshop -> GIMP). I disliked gimp at first, but now I like it more than photoshop.
2016-03-15 06:23:25	tadzik	speaking of which, tumocs, are you around?
2016-03-15 06:23:26	NoirLess	>photoshop->gimp
2016-03-15 06:23:29	AciD`	and of course, the freely available Rebirth (that works great on wine)
2016-03-15 06:23:30	NoirLess	bad, bad example
2016-03-15 06:23:39	josefnpat	NoirLess: not really - selection tools are way better in GIMP
2016-03-15 06:23:46	qptain_Nemo	there is also Krita

2016-03-15 06:24:39	josefnpat	and sit me in front of anything other than gedit/vim, and I'm lost.

2016-03-15 09:09:51	Marezz	i cant, its just that where i work, they require confirmation that im sick from the doctor

2016-03-15 09:24:42	DrMcCoy	Since then, I haven't heard a peep from them. They didn't mail the Kickstarter updates to any PayPal backers (or at least not to me)

2016-03-15 09:37:02	gnarface	i doubt the intel card would be a big problem with civ5 though
2016-03-15 09:37:16	gnarface	but certainly you could fix the install
2016-03-15 09:37:20	gnarface	where there is a will there is a way
2016-03-15 09:37:26	gnarface	fix the install or reinstall
2016-03-15 09:37:30	gnarface	or even just run it in a VM

2016-03-15 09:41:18	gnarface	oh, right
2016-03-15 09:41:24	Marezz	and this was hdd i was trying to instal it on
2016-03-15 09:41:45	gnarface	if you ever pointed the windows installer at this disk though, it could have done it
2016-03-15 09:42:01	gnarface	also if you partitioned it with gparted maybe?
2016-03-15 09:42:14	gnarface	i'm not sure, but GPT can leave some sort of residue that screws things up, and there's a way to flush it
2016-03-15 09:42:23	Marezz	nope, i installed windows on ssd and that was it, gave 100gb to gnu+linux, rest was ntfs data storage
2016-03-15 09:42:24	gnarface	just repartitioning typically won't do it completely

2016-03-15 09:45:49	gnarface	Marezz: i've seen it before.  it is probably an issue with residual GPT data, even if its a mystery how that got there.  maybe some other installer or partitioner you used at some point
2016-03-15 09:46:16	gnarface	Marezz: i would recommend you wait for the next gen gpus THEN get a current one that's steeply discounted because its now the old one

2016-03-15 09:47:49	Marezz	its supposedly faster than gtx 960
2016-03-15 09:51:12	BTRE	Marezz, a 380x might be flaky on linux. I have a friend who got one beginning of the year. But maybe with the 4.5 kernel it'll have improved.
2016-03-15 09:51:26	BTRE	It crashed sometimes with mesa and catalyst is, well, catalyst.
2016-03-15 09:51:57	Marezz	shame, i have to say i had nice experience with mesa and r9 270x
2016-03-15 09:52:49	Marezz	only that i had screen tearing with it, not matter which distro or driver i used, it really annoyed me
2016-03-15 09:54:41	BTRE	Well, my only direct experience with it was at the beginning of the year, since i helped him build the computer. So it may have changed.
2016-03-15 09:55:03	BTRE	Like I mentioned, the 4.5 kernel might have changed things. It brings a lot of amdgpu changes.
2016-03-15 09:55:11	Marezz	BTRE, could you please ask him about his experience with it and let me know?
2016-03-15 09:55:19	Marezz	when you got the time of course
2016-03-15 09:55:42	BTRE	Oh, well, we've played stuff online since then.
2016-03-15 09:56:08	BTRE	It runs stuff with no problem, but he's not a techie so he wouldn't know about how good it *should* be running.

2016-03-15 10:01:51	Ravenholm	How would people feel if Microsoft announced an App Store for Linux to bring their games to the platform?
2016-03-15 10:02:06	Ravenholm	They've been making insane announcements the last couple of weeks
2016-03-15 10:02:10	Ravenholm	nothing will surprise me
2016-03-15 10:02:33	BTRE	I would be okay with that. As much as I dislike MS, more competition is better for us.
2016-03-15 10:02:43	BTRE	Would never happen in a million years though :)
2016-03-15 10:02:48	Ravenholm	I dunno
2016-03-15 10:02:59	Marezz	gief halo nao
2016-03-15 10:03:05	Ravenholm	I think we'll see Office on Linux at some point
2016-03-15 10:03:19	 < 	kingron (~kingron@x5ce729a6.dyn.telefonica.de) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-03-15 10:03:24	BTRE	Yeah, that's plausible.
2016-03-15 10:03:38	Ravenholm	if we see Office, we'll probably see some sort of app platform
2016-03-15 10:03:38	BTRE	But I doubt we'll see the dx12 only games they've paid money to keep on their platforms.
2016-03-15 10:04:04	Ravenholm	Did you see their Xbox Live announcement?
2016-03-15 10:04:35	BTRE	Which?
2016-03-15 10:04:46	BTRE	The PC store stuff?
2016-03-15 10:04:49	Ravenholm	They're now allowing developers to implement cross platform play
2016-03-15 10:04:57	BTRE	Yeah, I did then.
2016-03-15 10:04:59	Ravenholm	i.e they're allowing Xbox players to play with PS4 players
2016-03-15 10:05:53	Ravenholm	also potentially Steam and Origin players too
2016-03-15 10:06:00	Ravenholm	they're not locking out any platforms it seems
2016-03-15 10:06:10	BTRE	Annoyingly, Rocket League will be out for every other platform before us with full crossplay it seems.

2016-03-15 10:52:00	stqn	are you logged in?
2016-03-15 10:52:00	corppneq	what am i doing wrong?
2016-03-15 10:52:02	corppneq	yes
2016-03-15 10:52:10	corppneq	https://www.gamingonlinux.com/profiles/3996
2016-03-15 10:52:10	stqn	should be at the bottom
2016-03-15 10:52:10	GolBot	[ Linux Gamer User Profile | GamingOnLinux ]
2016-03-15 10:52:28	stqn	also JS is needed, probably.
2016-03-15 10:52:55	corppneq	js is on, ublock disabled
2016-03-15 10:53:03	corppneq	but i block some domains via hosts file
2016-03-15 10:53:08	corppneq	what domains do i need?
2016-03-15 10:53:22	stqn	I don’t think you need to allow any third party
2016-03-15 10:54:16	stqn	I have ublock, ghostery and noscript running, only gamingonlinux.com is allowed in noscript
2016-03-15 10:54:43	corppneq	HTTPS Everywhere is no disabled to, still no form
2016-03-15 10:54:55	stqn	I also have https everywhere running ;)
2016-03-15 10:55:05	corppneq	also when i click on Quote nothing happens
2016-03-15 10:55:18	stqn	that requires JS
2016-03-15 10:55:20	stqn	for sure
2016-03-15 10:55:33	stqn	besides that… no idea what’s wrong
2016-03-15 10:55:34	corppneq	js is on
2016-03-15 10:56:07	stqn	is this a new account?
2016-03-15 10:56:37	stqn	maybe they put some antispam measure in place that restricts commenting…
2016-03-15 10:56:43	corppneq	yes, I just created the account to comment
2016-03-15 10:56:52	stqn	Piratelv: any idea?
2016-03-15 10:56:57	corppneq	meh, I even linked to steam and twitter
2016-03-15 10:57:53	corppneq	when I am locked out I see "Due to spam you need to Register and Login to comment."
2016-03-15 10:57:59	corppneq	when I am locked in nothing
2016-03-15 10:58:10	corppneq	can somebody drop the comment for me?
2016-03-15 10:58:26	stqn	well you could (if possible) mention the issue in the bugs forum
2016-03-15 10:58:39	gnarface	corppneq: maybe a browser compatibility issue?
2016-03-15 10:59:35	corppneq	i will try firefox
2016-03-15 11:01:01	corppneq	nope
2016-03-15 11:01:02	corppneq	no form
2016-03-15 11:01:15	gnarface	oh, well it was just a guess
2016-03-15 11:05:21	corppneq	I also got no mail to verify my address. is that normal
2016-03-15 11:05:22	corppneq	?
2016-03-15 11:05:54	gnarface	uh, i don't know, but i suspect it may be a bug
2016-03-15 11:06:39	stqn	yes, maybe a new bug since there was a web site update a few days ago
2016-03-15 11:07:49	stqn	if you come back earlier tomorrow (or later tonight depending on your time zone…) you should be able to talk to NaughtySquid about that and he should be able to help.

2016-03-16 06:31:17	Marezz	what is amdgpu exactly?
2016-03-16 06:32:25	BTRE	The driver in Mesa for newer AMD GPUs.
2016-03-16 06:33:11	AciD`	(and by newer it means since 2012, so newer and kinda older)
2016-03-16 06:34:08	stqn	amdgpu is not in mesa actually, it’s a kernel module, right?
2016-03-16 06:34:40	stqn	and it will be used by both the open-source (mesa) and closed source (successor to fglrx) AMD drivers

2016-03-16 06:36:23	BTRE	A large chunk of it is in the kernel, yes.
2016-03-16 06:36:34	BTRE	At least from my understanding.
2016-03-16 06:41:11	mirv_	amdgpu is the kernel driver component

2016-03-16 06:43:33	BTRE	mirv_, there's stuff like the ddx driver that's separate but also falls under 'amdgpu', right?
2016-03-16 06:43:55	BTRE	and I guess DRM wouldn't be in the kernel either

2016-03-16 07:13:41	mirv_	BTRE, just mean that amdgpu is the kernel space driver, and is not actually a part of mesa directly
2016-03-16 07:13:47	mirv_	though mesa of course uses amdgpu
2016-03-16 07:14:02	Marezz	what the heck?? is that a spartan on no5? http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i134/cataphract_40/aoe4and5.jpg

2016-03-17 04:25:51	@NaughtySquid	this random redditor claiming he has signed an NDA with a third party about upcoming ports <_<
2016-03-17 04:26:19	gnarface	well, i can claim to have all kinds of interesting information that cannot be disclosed too
2016-03-17 04:26:27	@NaughtySquid	honestly, his reddit post just sounds like hes going off the teaser from feral
2016-03-17 04:26:49	gnarface	well, to be fair he'd sound like an elevator pitch if he actually worked for them too, probably

2016-03-17 04:27:19	gnarface	lower level devs rarely are privy to the entire marketing plan
2016-03-17 04:27:58	@Samsai	he signed an NDA a couple hours ago and he's already teasing people
2016-03-17 04:28:12	gnarface	he could be PART of the marketing plan
2016-03-17 04:28:27	gnarface	he could be an intern paid to start a discussion about it
2016-03-17 04:29:11	gnarface	or a contractor or something
2016-03-17 04:29:39	gnarface	none of that means he knows anything more than what he's said though
2016-03-17 04:29:51	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: his nda should be removed

2016-03-17 05:49:43	Marezz	gnarface,  heya, hows it going? was just wondering if its a good idea to wipe hdd anyway anmd install new distro? :D
2016-03-17 05:50:11	gnarface	Marezz: hehe how do you expect me to respond to that?
2016-03-17 05:50:45	gnarface	of course you should wipe your hdd and install a new distro.  everyone should do it until its no longer a big deal to do
2016-03-17 05:50:55	gnarface	when it changes from risky to boring, then you're done
2016-03-17 05:52:01	qptain_Nemo	psymin: not sure what you mean
2016-03-17 05:52:14	gnarface	but just for the short term, getting Steam working in Linux, you and i both know its known to work on devuan
2016-03-17 05:52:20	psymin	first had issues making an acct, now have issues logging in
2016-03-17 05:52:44	disharmonic	hey
2016-03-17 05:53:12	gnarface	Marezz: alternately you could just file a bug report with void linux and see how they respond?
2016-03-17 05:53:45	gnarface	Marezz: or did you try it already?
2016-03-17 05:53:56	Marezz	gnarfacegn tbh i dont think its worth bothering with void
2016-03-17 05:54:28	psymin	^
2016-03-17 05:54:37	gnarface	Marezz: well that's good because i concur
2016-03-17 05:55:02	Marezz	gnarface,  and im hesitant to install devuanb since its alpha and its not rid of systemd with xfce install..
2016-03-17 05:55:23	disharmonic	So, Playstation VR looks like a nice deal. Of course you'll pay the price later on, because of the cost of PS4 games. But still it's quite tempting
2016-03-17 05:55:40	@Samsai	can ps4 into vr?
2016-03-17 05:55:50	psymin	they claim it can
2016-03-17 05:55:57	gnarface	Marezz: by "devuanb" do you mean devuan testing/ceres?
2016-03-17 05:56:01	tumocs	anything can
2016-03-17 05:56:03	psymin	no reason to release vr for it in oct if ps4 can't right?

2016-03-17 05:56:12	tumocs	like virtual boy
2016-03-17 05:56:55	Marezz	gnarface,  no, just stable, i believe even one of the devs said its not completely rid of suysstemd
2016-03-17 05:57:10	Marezz	the xfce install that is
2016-03-17 05:57:11	@Samsai	i mean, the ps4 is already struggling with the current games
2016-03-17 05:57:21	redje	Samsai: im supporting Liam on patreon, how do i get the badge on my profile?
2016-03-17 05:57:27	@Samsai	and they should drive content like that on two screens at relatively high framerate
2016-03-17 05:57:46	@Samsai	redje, when liam gets an email at the beginning of next month he'll add the badges
2016-03-17 05:58:01	dis_	Well, i'd expect it to be less realistic than PC, but it might still be a good intro. And let's not pretend VR on Linux will be possible in 2016. I just don't see it happening until Vulkan gets some real adoption
2016-03-17 05:58:18	redje	oké, ty for the info
2016-03-17 05:58:56	gnarface	Marezz: i wasn't aware of that.  i thought it was just not completely rid of libsystemd, but systemd itself is gone
2016-03-17 05:59:08	gnarface	Marezz: but either way, you don't actually need xfce
2016-03-17 05:59:09	redje	hes at almost 66% of his first goal not bad
2016-03-17 05:59:23	@Samsai	dis_, i have more trust in linux doing proper VR than a ps4
2016-03-17 05:59:36	dis_	Marezz: What's your issue with systemd, aside from the fact that it's a MS like interface developed by ppl with a god complex

2016-03-17 06:06:40	dis_	I just don't think Ubisoft deserves ppls trust. Only Activision rancks higher in my Evil meter
2016-03-17 06:06:50	qptain_Nemo	well i know rainbow six siege is really fun and i wish it or an equivalent was on linux
2016-03-17 06:06:51	dis_	on
2016-03-17 06:07:03	qptain_Nemo	even though i have no respect for ubisoft
2016-03-17 06:07:56	gnarface	Marezz: i'd suggest a minimal install with just blackbox as your WM.  then get steam working, and once you have steam and all the drivers sorted, you can change your WM to Moksha and let me know how it works :)
2016-03-17 06:09:26	dis_	I'm guessing Gentoo with OpenRC isn't in good shape atm?

2016-03-17 06:13:11	Marezz	gnarface,  only thing i would be unhappy about is that i would lose around 19gb of star trek episodes :(
2016-03-17 06:13:11	dis_	:D
2016-03-17 06:13:19	Marezz	190gb*
2016-03-17 06:13:42	gnarface	Marezz: certainly you don't have to lose them
2016-03-17 06:13:43	dis_	Marezz: Use a livecd to move them?
2016-03-17 06:14:13	qptain_Nemo	why would you possibly need to lose them?
2016-03-17 06:14:14	Marezz	dis_,  distros see that drive as empty and unpartitioned free space
2016-03-17 06:14:31	gnarface	Marezz: try the gparted livecd on it
2016-03-17 06:14:34	Marezz	installing new distro would remove ability to use that data
2016-03-17 06:14:36	dis_	Samsai, qptain_Nemo : btw i did not get that reference
2016-03-17 06:15:15	gnarface	Marezz: you could in theory use gparted to repartition, after fixing that problem with your partition tables.  then the distros will see your partitions, and you can tell it not to format the one storing the star trek
2016-03-17 06:15:27	qptain_Nemo	dis_: basically when Ubisoft advertized watch_dogs or some of its DLC they had a reference to the protagonist's "iconic" cap. and that was either before the release of the game or soon after
2016-03-17 06:15:30	dis_	Marezz: You killed the partition table?
2016-03-17 06:15:58	stqn	dis_: why would Gentoo with OpenRC not be in good shape?
2016-03-17 06:16:08	Marezz	dis_,  i didnt do anything, its just that i can only see/use it from my installed distro, when i boot another one from usb it doesnt see it
2016-03-17 06:16:14	Marezz	well it see it buyt as free space
2016-03-17 06:16:46	dis_	stqn: Nobody suggested it
2016-03-17 06:16:49	Marezz	gnarface, wouldnt reparitioning cause the loss of data on said drive?
2016-03-17 06:17:04	stqn	dis_: well that’s what I’m using.
2016-03-17 06:17:09	stqn	it’s working.
2016-03-17 06:17:20	dis_	qptain_Nemo: lol.
2016-03-17 06:18:07	gnarface	Marezz: no, not necessarily.  with gparted its possible to move and resize partitions without data loss, if you're careful
2016-03-17 06:18:11	stqn	I guess Marezz will come to the point when he has tried all the systemd-free distros except Gentoo, and he will install and use Gentoo, like I have ;).
2016-03-17 06:18:23	stqn	Because all the other ones are broken.
2016-03-17 06:19:18	stqn	(slight exagerration, but not very far from the truth)
2016-03-17 06:20:02	dis_	I was watching the AMD livestream on Monday and at one point they had 2 devs on stage. 1 from Ubi and 1 from Dice/EA. So the question about what is their favourite game comes up. The guy from EA just said Xcom2, which surprised me tbh. The Ubisoft guy mostly talked up Ubisoft games, after he mentioned he didn't have much time due to a baby.
2016-03-17 06:20:34	qptain_Nemo	interesting
2016-03-17 06:22:53	gnarface	Marezz: if you weren't at the other end of the fucking planet, i'd just offer to let you borrow a spare backup drive for a day

2016-03-17 06:23:41	qptain_Nemo	yeah but then you'd get it back with 190 gbs of star trek all over it D:
2016-03-17 06:24:49	gnarface	Marezz: since i have a 3rd-world internet connection, it would take you probably the better part of the rest of the year to upload 190GB to my servers :(

2016-03-17 06:49:39	gnarface	hidekin_: whenever a city tries to create residential broadband, usually the major ISP's in the area manage to shut it down through law suits.  occasionally they fail and some locations get decent municipal broadband or wifi, but its rare
2016-03-17 06:49:58	Raven67854	Like Chattanooga

2016-03-17 06:59:08	Raven67854	Be nice for them to ditch android on some of their stuff
2016-03-17 06:59:15	Raven67854	go to an actual Linux distro
2016-03-17 06:59:17	gnarface	probably they hired some linux devs and someone leaped to the conclusion they were gonna make a linux distro
2016-03-17 06:59:29	gnarface	but it wouldn't be stupid for them to do so

2016-03-17 07:08:08	gnarface	hmmm
2016-03-17 07:08:24	gnarface	i guess that's expected.  i'm not sure if "simple" and "secure" are a thing with cryptography
2016-03-17 07:09:02	psymin	libgcrypt?
2016-03-17 07:09:19	gnarface	hehe, is there an rot13 crypt lib?
2016-03-17 07:09:31	Smilex	well eventually I decided to write my own, which just means to spend ages trying to understand the information, and writing it in code as best as possible.
2016-03-17 07:10:18	gnarface	well, if nothing else, i'm sure that's a good path to learning a lot...

2016-03-17 07:12:12	gnarface	Smilex: ever heard of the caesar-cypher
2016-03-17 07:12:13	psymin	*snort* I mean
2016-03-17 07:12:19	Smilex	gnarface: No
2016-03-17 07:12:32	gnarface	Smilex: may also be listed as "one time pad"
2016-03-17 07:12:57	Smilex	Ok I know it
2016-03-17 07:13:10	gnarface	Smilex: basically, the encryption methodology used back in WW2, its a simple enough algorithm, and it should be easy to find lots of documentation on how to implement it
2016-03-17 07:13:44	gnarface	designed primarily for alphanumeric data though, transmitting binary data streams through it might be... impractical.
2016-03-17 07:13:57	gnarface	still, it could be a good place to start
2016-03-17 07:14:08	Smilex	gnarface: but I need to write a OAuth library. So I need a SSL/TLS library
2016-03-17 07:14:11	turol	no, caesar cypher and one-time pads are not the same thing
2016-03-17 07:14:12	@Samsai	you could also write a library that tattoos the message on a bald man's head, waits until the man has enough hair to cover the message and then sends that man to the recipient
2016-03-17 07:14:23	turol	and the codes used in ww2 are hell of a lot more sophisticated than caesar
2016-03-17 07:14:29	gnarface	turol: i thought the caesar cypher was just basically a specific one-time pad
2016-03-17 07:14:32	turol	they did use some variants of OTP in some places though
2016-03-17 07:14:44	turol	gnarface: no, caesar uses the same shift for all characters
2016-03-17 07:14:52	gnarface	oh i see
2016-03-17 07:14:55	turol	OTP has a key which is the same length as the message
2016-03-17 07:15:05	gnarface	right, a different shift for every letter
2016-03-17 07:15:17	gnarface	theoretically modular
2016-03-17 07:15:22	gnarface	so it can be swapped out
2016-03-17 07:15:30	gnarface	to move the target
2016-03-17 07:17:00	gnarface	Smilex: well on the plus side, you probably don't have to understand ALL of the gnutls or openssl library's features to actually learn enough of them to properly implement an OAuth setup
2016-03-17 07:17:42	gnarface	Smilex: separating what you need to know *right now* from what won't be important until later is a useful skill
2016-03-17 07:18:03	Smilex	gnarface: No, but I also have to prove to the world that I know better, so I guess I should always take the opportunity
2016-03-17 07:18:34	gnarface	i guess that's true, time permitting
2016-03-17 07:20:08	gnarface	just for the record though, i'd consider OAuth to be the weak link in any chain
2016-03-17 07:20:31	gnarface	choice of cryptography immaterial
2016-03-17 07:20:45	gnarface	OAuth2 at least

2016-03-17 07:32:37	gnarface	Smilex: (not the first massive hole that's been found in it)
2016-03-17 07:34:04	Smilex	I only need OAuth 1 for now. My inital plan was to test my GUI lib by writing a nice Twitter client, but it's just getting more and more complicated
2016-03-17 07:34:38	gnarface	you're kindof jumping into the deep end of the pool here
2016-03-17 07:35:03	gnarface	expect daunting complexity, try to take it in stride
2016-03-17 07:35:44	gnarface	compartmentalize the layers conceptually, so its easier to focus on the concepts and technology individually without getting confused by parts you don't know yet, and getting separate layers all messed up in your head

2016-03-17 07:38:50	stqn	writing your own tls lib seems overkill and prove to errors. Surely a nice learning experience, but security is hard…
2016-03-17 07:38:54	gnarface	Smilex: sorry, i guess you probably know all that.  what i mean to say is the complexity gets easier to deal with; it might be a mistake to avoid it too much.  you might limit yourself

2016-03-17 07:46:17	stqn	about sha1, yep, not recommended for security purposes. sha256 or 512 are better (sha512 is quite slow on old 32 bit cpus).

2016-03-17 08:35:05	redje	ok
2016-03-17 08:35:11	gnarface	or was it 5 computers?

2016-03-17 08:35:38	BTRE	stupid
2016-03-17 08:35:44	BTRE	which is the only multiplayer setting
2016-03-17 08:35:50	redje	ok lol
2016-03-17 08:36:00	BTRE	it's only humans that gain bonus/malus in MP

2016-03-17 08:36:13	BTRE	nah, less than that
2016-03-17 08:36:18	BTRE	the ai is dumber in multiplayer
2016-03-17 08:36:31	BTRE	it's a design feature
2016-03-17 08:36:35	gnarface	BTRE: we all chose prince level difficulty.  i'm assuming that's what redje meant to ask
2016-03-17 08:37:04	gnarface	redje: prince difficulty, but we did turn "raging barbarians" on
2016-03-17 08:37:31	gnarface	redje: and we did not choose same teams

2016-03-17 08:38:17	gnarface	i would be up for starting a co-op game where we're all on one team against many AI, in pairs perhaps, or on their own teams (definitely not all on the same team)
2016-03-17 08:38:43	BTRE	I remember doing coop in civ 3 with a friend against the hardest ai
2016-03-17 08:38:46	BTRE	that was special
2016-03-17 08:38:49	redje	couple of years ago i used to play deity and immortal
2016-03-17 08:39:42	gnarface	i don't think i've ever won a game above emperor level, and even then i was playing co-op with someone far more experienced at it
2016-03-17 08:39:49	redje	but not playing the game that much anymore and when i play it mostly at emperor in single player
2016-03-17 08:39:58	BTRE	Yeah, I'm about the same redje
2016-03-17 08:40:52	redje	i remember i when deity games couple of years ago by building empire behind mountain chooke points
2016-03-17 08:41:14	BTRE	in earlier versions of civ 5, maritime city states were broken as hell
2016-03-17 08:41:41	BTRE	getting them as allies was a no-brainer because of the insane amount of growth
2016-03-17 08:41:43	gnarface	yea they changed it so in multiplayer, triremes are no longer a ranged ship
2016-03-17 08:42:11	gnarface	i think the single player missions, and games without any of the DLC though still have them as ranged
2016-03-17 08:42:17	gnarface	oh you said city-states

2016-03-17 08:50:49	BTRE	Yeah, from what they've mentioned the beginning of the game is 4xish
2016-03-17 08:50:59	BTRE	and then the middle part (which they haven't shown) is more like EU
2016-03-17 08:51:27	BTRE	and the end game is something different, with a lot of internal stuff, like possible AI uprisings if you researched tech too much, or population breaking away
2016-03-17 08:51:45	BTRE	It sounds weird but cool at the same time.

2016-03-17 09:11:43	redje	what i love about the paradox games is that it has a hard learning curve but great reward
2016-03-17 09:11:58	@NaughtySquid	i hate their learning curve
2016-03-17 09:12:02	@NaughtySquid	but stellaris is my kind of setting
2016-03-17 09:12:06	@NaughtySquid	so it will make me want to learn
2016-03-17 09:13:04	redje	im gonna wait for some more gameplay to see if i really like this game
2016-03-17 09:13:18	tadzik	what discourages me is the fact that they don't seem to care about it at all, not even trying to grab more audience
2016-03-17 09:13:35	tadzik	ck2 has a non-interactive tutorial for fuck's sake
2016-03-17 09:13:52	redje	i really like civ5 but civ beyond earth is just not my thing but i just bought it when it was released with tux logo
2016-03-17 09:14:03	tadzik	it's expected of people to watch hours of youtube to learn how to play it
2016-03-17 09:14:21	@NaughtySquid	the first time i tried CK2 put me off
2016-03-17 09:14:27	@NaughtySquid	the tutorial was totally broken
2016-03-17 09:14:31	@NaughtySquid	as they updated game features
2016-03-17 09:14:33	@NaughtySquid	but not the tutorial
2016-03-17 09:14:35	tadzik	I can't get excited about Stellaris
2016-03-17 09:14:38	tadzik	grand strategy in space sounds awesome
2016-03-17 09:14:39	homerj	na, if you tried to dumb down Paradox games
2016-03-17 09:14:44	homerj	they would lose their audience
2016-03-17 09:14:55	homerj	like what would happen if Eve Online tried to do it
2016-03-17 09:15:01	tadzik	but it's Paradox, so I'd have to spend 48 hours learning the basics because they're unwilling to create a fucking tutorial
2016-03-17 09:15:07	@NaughtySquid	^
2016-03-17 09:15:15	tadzik	I'm not talking about dumbing it down, no
2016-03-17 09:15:30	tadzik	and yes, I do remember times when you had to read the 100 page instruction manual to know how to play the game
2016-03-17 09:15:34	homerj	well, my tutorial in ck2 is just play the game

2016-03-17 09:15:50	homerj	you'll figure it out if you play from start to 1453
2016-03-17 09:15:51	huw	if a typical PDS game had a tutorial that explained every single nuance of the game, you'd spend days just playing the tutorial
2016-03-17 09:16:08	tadzik	this tutorial didn't even say what's the objective, from what I remember
2016-03-17 09:16:17	tadzik	"click here for your kids. Got it? Good, off you go"
2016-03-17 09:16:29	homerj	I think what people who play want to go for is how to min/max everything
2016-03-17 09:16:35	redje	hope u guys are right i like a new challenge with paradox games
2016-03-17 09:16:38	homerj	and that's not the design
2016-03-17 09:16:51	redje	im gonna logg GN
2016-03-17 09:17:34	redje	and yes lol at the ck2 tutorial that was useless indeed :p
2016-03-17 09:17:43	homerj	you can read all the tutorials in the world, but the only way you're going to know what's going on is to just play it
2016-03-17 09:17:45	tadzik	interestingly, I don't feel that way about Civ5. I'm not saying it's as complicated as Paradox's stuff, but it gets basic teaching principles right

2016-03-17 09:19:47	tadzik	"easy to learn, hard to master" is better than "hard to master"
2016-03-17 09:19:51	homerj	ck2 really doesn't have an early/mid/late game
2016-03-17 09:20:08	stqn	tadzik: you’re talking about Civ 5’s tutorial? I found it to be broken… didn’t learn anything.
2016-03-17 09:20:10	homerj	you just kind of play it
2016-03-17 09:20:11	tadzik	yeah, I used the wrong phrase
2016-03-17 09:20:26	tadzik	stqn: frankly, I don't even remember if there was a tutorial :)
2016-03-17 09:20:31	tadzik	I started on the easiest difficulty and the smallest map
2016-03-17 09:20:43	tadzik	and the "end turn" button that changed its text did all I needed
2016-03-17 09:20:52	stqn	I remember it telling me to do a couple things, ok, I did them, and then… nothing…  I had no idea what to do.
2016-03-17 09:21:03	homerj	if you want to learn to play Civ5, there's a guy on youtube, MadDjinn that has a shitload of let's plays
2016-03-17 09:21:12	homerj	and basically makes a mockery of Deity
2016-03-17 09:21:43	huw	tadzik: you just aren't the type for PDS games, simple as that. a game isn't better because its tutorial is better
2016-03-17 09:21:56	stqn	huw: of course it is
2016-03-17 09:22:07	huw	stqn: of course it isn't
2016-03-17 09:22:11	huw	i can do this all day!
2016-03-17 09:22:36	stqn	I’m sure you can…
2016-03-17 09:22:49	tadzik	huw: I'm not saying it is, as I said, I haven't bothered to play it properly :)
2016-03-17 09:23:02	huw	cool
2016-03-17 09:23:03	homerj	but they are a sandbox
2016-03-17 09:23:06	homerj	try stuff, see what happens
2016-03-17 09:23:12	tadzik	because it does an absolute garbage job at attracting anyone who isn't already dedicated to spend days on it
2016-03-17 09:23:13	homerj	eventually you learn what to do and what not to do
2016-03-17 09:23:30	huw	tadzik: i do sympathise. i couldn't quite get into CK2, but EU4 is a masterpiece IMO. however it took me a LONG time to learn to play it
2016-03-17 09:24:05	homerj	because playing just to get land is only one way to play it
2016-03-17 09:24:31	homerj	some people like to make certain kingdoms and empires, try to spread culture as much as possible, or get family members on every throne
2016-03-17 09:24:45	huw	yeh. there's no right or wrong way to play
2016-03-17 09:24:47	tadzik	I gotta admit, your "just play it" goes in contrast with everything I've heard so far about these games
2016-03-17 09:25:04	huw	heh. "just play it" would be my advice too for what it's worth
2016-03-17 09:25:14	homerj	although I will admit, I have 1k hours into it, and I still don't REALLY know how combat works
2016-03-17 09:25:14	tadzik	so far the conclusion I got from all my friends who play it was "yeah, just watch this 10 hour introduction on youtube"
2016-03-17 09:25:34	huw	when i first learned EU4 i tried watching let's plays etc, but it put me to sleep. i learned barely anything. eventually i just jumped in, and it started to click after a while

2016-03-17 09:25:51	homerj	yeah, because you can explain for two hours how strong vs. weak claims work
2016-03-17 09:25:52	tadzik	I wonder if it's still unreadable on, well, mid-dpi, let's call it
2016-03-17 09:26:12	homerj	but until you actually play though it and get one, and see how they get passed down, it's all gibberish
2016-03-17 09:26:44	huw	inheritance rules are the main reason i couldn't get into CK2
2016-03-17 09:26:54	tadzik	. o O ( TTF – time to fun )
2016-03-17 09:27:13	huw	"you have no heir in x province!"  YES I DO HE'S RIGHT THERE WHY WON'T HE SUCCEED ME?!
2016-03-17 09:27:15	homerj	you know what game this also applies to?

2016-03-17 09:28:02	tadzik	the demo, at least
2016-03-17 09:28:04	homerj	see what works, what doesn't
2016-03-17 09:28:13	huw	heh. i tried kerbal for all of 20 mins before giving up. but it's my failing, not the game's
2016-03-17 09:28:29	huw	if it was easier to learn it wouldn't be the game people love
2016-03-17 09:28:38	tadzik	I had some fun getting my thing to crash, but it didn't seem appealing enough for the price to me. Plus, it was early access, and I rarely get into that

2016-03-17 09:29:26	homerj	well, Kerbal is redoing their tutorial stuff
2016-03-17 09:29:30	homerj	for 1.1
2016-03-17 09:29:39	tadzik	it's full of stuff that's generally considered among the hardest things around
2016-03-17 09:29:50	tadzik	but it's so easy to read, follow, eventually understand
2016-03-17 09:29:53	homerj	I have only one real issue with Kerbal, and it's the same issue I have with Cities:Skylines
2016-03-17 09:30:02	tadzik	making the book shittier would not make the subject any less interesting
2016-03-17 09:30:17	homerj	they are so dependent on mods, and the next big mod is always "right around the corner" and it's difficult to really want to put effort into doing something

2016-03-17 09:31:45	homerj	xcom1's tutorial was worse than useless
2016-03-17 09:31:55	homerj	it tried to get you to do stuff you really shouldn't do
2016-03-17 09:32:07	homerj	and you wouldn't do in practice
2016-03-17 09:32:12	huw	what i hate is tutorials that are open enough that you can do something wrong and not be powerful enough to explain what you did wrong
2016-03-17 09:32:28	huw	now that is a crap way to teach a game
2016-03-17 09:32:37	homerj	like all the nagging about not using explosives

2016-03-17 09:37:44	tadzik	wait until it goes out of beta
2016-03-17 09:37:47	homerj	yeah
2016-03-17 09:37:55	homerj	I do that with all strategy games

2016-03-17 09:38:18	homerj	the release is more like open beta
2016-03-17 09:38:28	homerj	you start to learn strategies that turn useless
2016-03-17 09:38:58	homerj	it's inherent to the genre, more than any failings on their part

2016-03-17 10:47:38	gnarface	i guess they probably thought they had found a solution to the problem where the key that can skip the cutscene is hard to guess, but maybe didn't think it out as well as they should have

2016-03-17 10:55:36	Marezz	gnarface: i have been thinking.. maybe i should get a cheaper gpu this time? im afraid to get something more expensive because of what happened to my last card.. its a really heavey hit on my pocket :S
2016-03-17 10:56:05	gnarface	Marezz: i always wait until they get cheaper, i never buy the latest hottest item anymore
2016-03-17 10:56:16	gnarface	Marezz: i'm still using a GTX560Ti
2016-03-17 10:56:22	Marezz	gnarface: it barely lasted 2.5yrs
2016-03-17 10:56:35	Marezz	gnarface: wow, how does it fare with todays games?
2016-03-17 10:57:48	gnarface	Marezz: yea another thing i found out is that with video gaming cards, lots of the "most popular" manufacturers make really poorly-cooled, fragile solutions.  you want to pick a vendor that is ethical; clock speeds and benchmarks between otherwise identical units - then you buy the one that has slightly higher clocked ram?  guess what; that one is gonna probably die early
2016-03-17 10:59:12	gnarface	Marezz: so i wouldn't say go for cheap/expensive, i'd say go for the brand that has been around the longest and is the best respected
2016-03-17 10:59:22	gnarface	Marezz: there should be reviews about the longevity of their cards
2016-03-17 10:59:48	gnarface	Marezz: but you shouldn't expect gaming cards to last forever; they're notoriously high-wear
2016-03-17 11:00:19	gnarface	Marezz: it helps to re-seat the heatsync sometimes yourself, that can get a few extra years out of some cards that have poorly applied thermal paste
2016-03-17 11:00:28	gnarface	(seen this problem with evga a lot)
2016-03-17 11:01:03	Marezz	gnarface: isnt evga considered for a better brand?
2016-03-17 11:01:35	gnarface	Marezz: as for my 560 ti, it probably won't play shadow of mordor for shit but i don't really care.  when i can get a good gtx 980 with like 6GB of ram for 200$ i might upgrade
2016-03-17 11:02:23	gnarface	Marezz: and yea, evag is considered a better brand by popular hardware review sites, but usually because their cards do a bit better in benchmarks against equivalent models in other brands :-/  this should be a warning sign!
2016-03-17 11:02:34	stqn	gnarface: I’m not sure, in theory it’s space to stop the cutscenes.
2016-03-17 11:02:57	stqn	the game has an in-game bug report tool, so I told them… and then I restarted the game, but big deal
2016-03-17 11:03:02	stqn	s/but/no/
2016-03-17 11:03:02	GolBot	stqn meant to say: the game has an in-game bug report tool, so I told themâ¦ and then I restarted the game, no big deal
2016-03-17 11:03:05	Marezz	gnarface: so i should not be chasing those OC editions?
2016-03-17 11:03:13	gnarface	Marezz: its sufficient for stuff like portal, insurgency, team fortress2, civ5, etc
2016-03-17 11:03:21	Raven67854	EVGA cards are typically factory overclocked
2016-03-17 11:03:23	gnarface	Marezz: hell no don't ever buy OC editions
2016-03-17 11:03:28	Raven67854	I prefer Asus GPU's though. Them stock coolers are nice
2016-03-17 11:03:42	Marezz	gnarface: mine was OC edition :S i guess thats why it died so fast
2016-03-17 11:03:55	gnarface	Marezz: yea i agree with Raven67854 on that for once.  get a nice Asus, one of the quiet ones with dual fans
2016-03-17 11:04:12	Raven67854	They don't overclock them all that much
2016-03-17 11:04:21	Raven67854	Really doesn't affect lifespan at all
2016-03-17 11:04:59	Marezz	gnarface: found asus strix gtx 750ti 2gb for 142 euros new, wonder if thats worth it..
2016-03-17 11:05:09	Raven67854	Can play most games on medium -> high
2016-03-17 11:05:14	Raven67854	only needs power from the PCIE Slot
2016-03-17 11:05:32	stqn	similar to my 660 and Gnarface’s 560ti I think
2016-03-17 11:05:43	Raven67854	Pretty great card for what it is
2016-03-17 11:06:18	stqn	should be good enough for everything but ARK, if you don’t want to go above 1080p
2016-03-17 11:06:40	Raven67854	Ark runs like shit. Also the devs spent precious time on the xboxOne / that new game that launched today
2016-03-17 11:06:42	Raven67854	Fuck the ark
2016-03-17 11:06:50	gnarface	Marezz: even with my 560 being so old, what limits it most with the newer games is the amount of ram, it only has 1GB.  you definitely want 4GB minimum for a lot of the latest titles
2016-03-17 11:06:59	Marezz	I dont think I will be moving from 1080p any time soon because for some strange reason, price skyrocket after 1080p..

2016-03-17 11:10:18	Raven67854	I mean few bucks more for extra 2gb of ram hells yeah
2016-03-17 11:11:10	gnarface	Marezz: or you could just play some Civ5 on the intel video, since it probably won't matter with Civ5
2016-03-17 11:11:16	Marezz	it got dangerously close to gtx 960 with that price, granted only 2gb variants
2016-03-17 11:11:31	Raven67854	960 is faster
2016-03-17 11:21:30	Marezz	gnarface: hmm 750ti should be near your card in performance if im not mistaken?
2016-03-17 11:22:04	gnarface	Marezz: i think its faster
2016-03-17 11:22:13	Marezz	750ti?

2016-03-17 11:28:02	Marezz	how long you had it?
2016-03-17 11:28:39	gnarface	since shortly after the 660 came out i think
2016-03-17 11:28:52	gnarface	it was on sale for about 200$
2016-03-17 11:29:00	Marezz	thats 3-4 years at least?
2016-03-17 11:29:34	stqn	hum, Dreamfall Chapters is nice, but without having played the first two games, the story doesn’t make much sense.
2016-03-17 11:29:35	gnarface	yea at least
2016-03-17 11:29:51	Marezz	which vendor?

2016-03-17 20:35:05	anonkun	Battlefield 3 was the only good purchase out of those imo.
2016-03-17 20:35:09	anonkun	GTA online is horrible.

2016-03-17 20:40:40	qptain_Nemo	i haven't booted into windows natively since last spring, and nuked my windows partition somewhere in autumn
2016-03-17 20:41:07	anonkun	something similar here, I wasn't booting into it and when I did boot into it to play gta V or battlefront, I only got more frustrated.
2016-03-17 20:42:16	ky0	I only use Windows at work, urgh
2016-03-17 20:42:19	Fenix2412	Removed windows once but got back to it... My PC is tooweak to play some linux ports that can work without problems on windows
2016-03-17 20:42:33	anonkun	hmm
2016-03-17 20:42:40	anonkun	ky0: Yeah, using windows at work is the worst
2016-03-17 20:42:46	Fenix2412	Also Paradox still didn't fix desync issue with their games
2016-03-17 20:43:12	anonkun	btw I dont seem to be getting screen tearing on unity + nonfree driver
2016-03-17 20:43:24	Fenix2412	So I still have to use windows if I want to play multiplayer in EU IV with my friends
2016-03-17 20:43:29	tumocs	Fenix2412, I haven't had any desync with other linux gamers, with windows people in game it's constantly desyncing
2016-03-17 20:43:45	tumocs	so real solution is to make your friends change to linux
2016-03-17 20:43:52	ky0	I'm still a bit meh'd about the difference in performance between the OS's but I've changed my standards and adapted to just what is available on Linux
2016-03-17 20:43:56	Fenix2412	They won't
2016-03-17 20:44:04	tumocs	then they shouldn't be friends
2016-03-17 20:44:13	anonkun	Well, I don't see gaming as the strong point of linux, I see everything else as the strong point.
2016-03-17 20:44:16	tumocs	friends don't make friends use windows
2016-03-17 20:44:37	Fenix2412	Friendship is not about forcing people to use OS that they don't want to use
2016-03-17 20:44:46	tumocs	it is
2016-03-17 20:44:51	Fenix2412	No
2016-03-17 20:44:53	tumocs	forced freedom is the only freedom
2016-03-17 20:44:57	anonkun	lol
2016-03-17 20:45:12	anonkun	I dont force my friends
2016-03-17 20:45:15	ky0	tumocs for the comm...
2016-03-17 20:45:17	ky0	companion!
2016-03-17 20:45:21	Fenix2412	Also you are from finland so you don't know what friendship is so shut up tumocs
2016-03-17 20:45:29	qptain_Nemo	you should force your friends in a way that respects their freedom :)
2016-03-17 20:45:35	anonkun	I say I will only install GNU/Linux on your pc. I don't do proprietary support :P
2016-03-17 20:46:35	qptain_Nemo	yeah i kinda stopped helping people with windows
2016-03-17 20:47:03	qptain_Nemo	thank fuck i'm genuinely starting to forget how things work too
2016-03-17 20:47:10	anonkun	yeah
2016-03-17 20:47:12	anonkun	Its a headache
2016-03-17 20:47:17	anonkun	that alone is worth stopping the support
2016-03-17 20:47:20	Fenix2412	qptain_Nemo: "It works for me. Maybe you should switch your os" :D
2016-03-17 20:47:23	anonkun	regardless of legal license
2016-03-17 20:47:30	qptain_Nemo	Fenix2412: yep
2016-03-17 20:50:33	ky0	btw... if you had to choose between Linux Mint 17.3 or Ubuntu 16.04... what would you install and why?
2016-03-17 20:50:59	anonkun	ubuntu 16
2016-03-17 20:51:03	anonkun	because
2016-03-17 20:51:12	anonkun	I've always found mint to have issues here and there
2016-03-17 20:51:29	anonkun	Their team just doesn't do a profressional job, imo...
2016-03-17 20:51:37	qptain_Nemo	at this point probably ubuntu
2016-03-17 20:52:05	anonkun	and mint is essentially just ubuntu, if you look at it.
2016-03-17 20:52:08	qptain_Nemo	mint's attitude towards security is dumb, but you can fix that in 3 seconds
2016-03-17 20:52:15	anonkun	No, not just security
2016-03-17 20:52:16	qptain_Nemo	but yeah, it's a direct ubuntu derivative

2016-03-17 20:54:02	ky0	everything seemed to work in mint, and in ubuntu I had to tweak stuff
2016-03-17 20:54:12	anonkun	I see
2016-03-17 20:54:30	anonkun	The latest ubuntu works great, though I had some weird text disappearing issue with the free driver.
2016-03-17 20:54:44	ky0	but Mr NaughtySquid has been talking to highly about 16.04 that I've been thinking of switching
2016-03-17 20:54:46	anonkun	I suspect its more unity related

2016-03-17 20:55:17	anonkun	It is quite good ky0
2016-03-17 20:55:50	qptain_Nemo	as a xfce fan it bothers me how basic and lame the default setup of xubuntu is :|

2016-03-17 20:56:05	qptain_Nemo	just make sure you enable security updates "V
2016-03-17 20:56:06	anonkun	I quite liked the whole xubuntu thing. Its very "modular"

2016-03-17 20:56:12	NuSuey	i'm 100% happy with arch and not going back to any -buntu / debian distros anymore
2016-03-17 20:56:21	Fenix2412	I'm using Kubuntu 15.10 now and the only problem I had was the gpu driver and by that I mean I had to switch to tty to install nvidia package because KDE doesn't even have a proper fallback mode when there is no gpu acceleration
2016-03-17 20:56:22	anonkun	I main on Manjaro :P
2016-03-17 20:56:31	qptain_Nemo	anonkun: i just don't like that the default setup shows a new user absolutely 0 features that make xfce awesome
2016-03-17 20:56:43	qptain_Nemo	like everything amazing about xfce is disabled by default
2016-03-17 20:56:49	anonkun	but ubuntu now has all the packages I use in aur.

2016-03-17 20:58:00	anonkun	Only thing on arch that bothers me is how I have to type in the password everytime after the AUR script fetches the update
2016-03-17 20:58:16	anonkun	is there a way to make it more "automatic"?

2016-03-18 01:03:16	gkeen_	Raven67854: i didnt say it did, just that it wasnt worth getting a ps4 for atm since it doesnt have vr either :P
2016-03-18 01:03:31	Raven67854	You can play bloodborne
2016-03-18 01:03:35	gkeen_	NuSuey: listen to him, hes right for once :D

2016-03-18 01:06:15	gkeen_	removed the overclock on the cpu just incase
2016-03-18 01:07:04	gkeen_	btw i was surprised on how well shadows of mordor ran in 4k.. no performance issues there

2016-03-18 01:08:44	Raven67854	Not a lot of ram for 4k though.. Might just be when it dumps the programs out of ram/swap just causes some hitching for a second while it shuffles everything about
2016-03-18 01:09:20	gkeen_	Raven67854: monitor goes standby when it happens
2016-03-18 01:09:29	Raven67854	Very weird
2016-03-18 01:09:32	Raven67854	display port?

2016-03-18 01:09:46	Raven67854	which nvidia driver?
2016-03-18 01:10:34	gkeen_	361.28
2016-03-18 01:10:43	Raven67854	I use that
2016-03-18 01:10:46	NuSuey	gkeen_: mordor? got it but havent played it
2016-03-18 01:10:59	Raven67854	I think feral patched mordor recently
2016-03-18 01:11:11	gkeen_	NuSuey: try it, its like the witcher but ehm easier :P
2016-03-18 01:11:35	Raven67854	That is true
2016-03-18 01:11:37	Raven67854	Damn easy game
2016-03-18 01:11:47	gkeen_	well.. its not bloodborn :D
2016-03-18 01:12:51	Raven67854	They're both fun in their own way
2016-03-18 01:13:06	Raven67854	bloodborne was damn great

2016-03-18 01:13:24	NuSuey	gkeen_: I should.. if I have the time :D so many games I have on pc & ps3 and im not playing..
2016-03-18 01:13:39	gkeen_	NuSuey: witcher was unplayable on linux imo.. performance was soo bad
2016-03-18 01:13:53	Raven67854	its cleared up heavily
2016-03-18 01:14:02	Raven67854	Witcher 2 runs about the same as it does on Windows for me
2016-03-18 01:14:10	Raven67854	But wow that initial release ah hahaha

2016-03-18 01:16:02	NuSuey	wanted to start playing wildstar again..but now since they fired all those people.. hmhmhmhm
2016-03-18 01:17:05	Raven67854	NuSuey, You also use windows?
2016-03-18 01:17:18	gkeen_	NuSuey: i will play it.. IF they release that "steamos" version :P
2016-03-18 01:17:30	NuSuey	Raven67854: yes but wanted to try it out agian in POL of course :) it was playable
2016-03-18 01:17:40	gkeen_	Raven67854: wildstar ran at a stable 60+ fps for me
2016-03-18 01:17:43	Raven67854	NuSuey, tried black desert?
2016-03-18 01:17:45	gkeen_	not so for NuSuey though
2016-03-18 01:17:56	NuSuey	Raven67854: nah ..dont wanna

2016-03-18 01:18:03	Raven67854	Really?
2016-03-18 01:18:08	Raven67854	So?
2016-03-18 01:18:33	NuSuey	i dont like em
2016-03-18 01:18:38	Raven67854	The NA/EU version doesn't have the cash shop
2016-03-18 01:18:39	NuSuey	liked the wildstar style and combat
2016-03-18 01:19:10	Raven67854	well it's not point and click combat
2016-03-18 01:20:54	NuSuey	if I had somebody to play with I would probably play wildstar.. when I setup my xbox controller thanks to antimicro with it.. it was a blast to play :)
2016-03-18 01:21:06	Raven67854	I never really got into wildstar
2016-03-18 01:21:10	Raven67854	and it died fast
2016-03-18 01:21:23	Raven67854	For all the hype and wonder around it. It really died
2016-03-18 01:21:35	gkeen_	so the f2p didnt help?
2016-03-18 01:21:46	Raven67854	Eh
2016-03-18 01:21:48	Raven67854	People still play it
2016-03-18 01:22:01	gkeen_	good, then i will be waiting for the proper linux version :D
2016-03-18 01:22:04	Raven67854	Games that go sub -> f2p just kinda meh
2016-03-18 01:22:17	Raven67854	Yeah I doubt that'll ever happen gkeen_
2016-03-18 01:22:29	gkeen_	Raven67854: they said it would happen
2016-03-18 01:22:45	Raven67854	They also said they'd never go f2p :p
2016-03-18 01:22:46	NuSuey	gkeen_: but since they fired a lot of people and stoped the china expansion, I doubt they will have the will / money to work on a steamos version :/
2016-03-18 01:22:51	Raven67854	They also said that the game would do well!
2016-03-18 01:23:35	NuSuey	and I have no clue what happened to the integration with steam thing.. they had a steam depot but nothing is happening
2016-03-18 01:23:49	NuSuey	adding it to steam would help them for sure

2016-03-18 04:39:23	Smilex	anonkun: you can't really compare it to something like Xbox with a lot of financial backing
2016-03-18 04:39:33	anonkun	Valve is really pouring money into this doe
2016-03-18 04:39:37	anonkun	just that no "exclusives"
2016-03-18 04:40:00	Smilex	anonkun: Valve has been treading sort of safely
2016-03-18 04:40:08	Smilex	there has been no massive marketing push from them
2016-03-18 04:40:14	anonkun	Becuase it's not ready yet.
2016-03-18 04:40:29	Smilex	Sure. It's just that you can't compare with XBox
2016-03-18 04:40:47	anonkun	I'm just saying the guys argument is invalid, since its not really a "self enforcing cycle".
2016-03-18 04:41:20	anonkun	People have incentive to develop for a platform that isn't necessarily full of players is all.
2016-03-18 04:41:46	anonkun	Wasn't there a statement or something where they said that pc gamers are only a minority in terms of income and most money comes from mobile games and stuff?
2016-03-18 04:42:37	Smilex	anonkun: it was a phase
2016-03-18 04:43:02	anonkun	As in?
2016-03-18 04:43:15	Smilex	a gold rush is what I meant. Was on the phone
2016-03-18 04:44:02	anonkun	No, I mean the statement was made this year itself
2016-03-18 04:44:09	anonkun	mobile gaming makes a lot more than pc gaming
2016-03-18 04:44:28	Smilex	but it's not true
2016-03-18 04:44:36	Cracker	Not at all true
2016-03-18 04:44:49	Cracker	Mobile gaming is pretty much dead in terms of making money
2016-03-18 04:44:50	Smilex	The Division probably made more than the entire mobile market.
2016-03-18 04:45:07	Smilex	Cracker: Well stabilized. A few make almost all of it
2016-03-18 04:45:11	stqn	I think only a few mobile games make a lot of money, and the rest almost nothing
2016-03-18 04:45:13	anonkun	oh wow
2016-03-18 04:45:13	Cracker	right
2016-03-18 04:45:16	Cracker	a few
2016-03-18 04:45:17	anonkun	so the article was a lie
2016-03-18 04:45:21	Cracker	the vast majority make zero
2016-03-18 04:45:23	anonkun	I just googled and it seems mobile gaming is a minorty
2016-03-18 04:45:25	anonkun	lol
2016-03-18 04:45:35	stqn	on Steam it’s much easier to find small "unknown" games
2016-03-18 04:45:48	stqn	(even if many are still mostly hidden deep in the list)
2016-03-18 04:46:13	Smilex	anonkun: Certain companies have a reason to push developers towards the mobile market, which is why you'll find things stating that it's good business, etc.
2016-03-18 04:47:07	anonkun	that makes sense
2016-03-18 04:47:11	anonkun	Also
2016-03-18 04:47:13	anonkun	a really big thing
2016-03-18 04:47:21	anonkun	Would VR work on linux? assuming its made for "pc"
2016-03-18 04:47:35	anonkun	I assume at least the HTC vive would?
2016-03-18 04:47:52	gnarface	i wouldn't hold my breath
2016-03-18 04:48:08	anonkun	is that a no?

2016-03-18 07:20:14	Smilex	yeah. I'd be checking for it, and falling back to ALSA. I assume those with running JACK servers want to use JACK

2016-03-18 10:15:56	Raven67854	If it was worded that during work hours/on work machines I'd be fine with that

2016-03-18 10:16:26	mirv_	dabblers-buffet, should be ok, but I'd separate them just to avoid them hitting each other and any possible damage to the contacts that way
2016-03-18 10:16:45	mirv_	if they'll just be in storage, don't worry about it though
2016-03-18 10:17:15	mirv_	Raven67854, yeah that's my response normally
2016-03-18 10:17:19	dabblers-buffet	Since they'll be in one anti-static bag & preventing ESD from ocurring, I was just a little concerned that the RAM modules would rub up against each other, creating ESD.

2016-03-18 10:29:27	mirv_	Raven67854, I suppose I could pull out some old physics code, try get something of that with hsa
2016-03-18 10:29:28	gnarface	yes, anti-static bags aren't special because they are static-resistant; they're not.  what makes them "anti-static" is just that they're not prone to generating static themselves, like most other plastic bags
2016-03-18 10:29:56	gnarface	but failing that, cardboard usually also is fairly static-free
2016-03-18 10:30:02	gnarface	just not waterproof
2016-03-18 10:30:41	dabblers-buffet	I have 2 anti-static bags, currently. One big one that's like the size of storing a motherboard & a smaller one that had a lithium-ion battery in it.
2016-03-18 10:30:56	dabblers-buffet	I usually just throw them out, but now I'm keeping them whenever I can.
2016-03-18 10:33:02	gnarface	yea when i build machines for myself i try to keep all the spare connection gear and stuff for them inside the motherboard box
2016-03-18 10:33:07	gnarface	manuals, etc

2016-03-18 10:43:48	qptain_Nemo	yes, some people do
2016-03-18 10:44:02	Raven67854	It doesn't require much more bandwidth jsut more processing power

2016-03-18 10:44:07	Raven67854	I'm in short supply of neither
2016-03-18 10:44:18	qptain_Nemo	well... it's objectively better is it not?

2016-03-18 10:44:32	Smilex	qptain_Nemo: for responsiveness
2016-03-18 10:44:38	Raven67854	The video looks smoother
2016-03-18 10:44:39	gnarface	higher framerate most certainly does cost more bandwidth
2016-03-18 10:44:39	Raven67854	It's nice

2016-03-18 10:44:58	gnarface	well, depends alot on the content
2016-03-18 10:45:09	gnarface	30fps content sure won't
2016-03-18 10:45:22	Raven67854	Not even going to bother with that dumb argument
2016-03-18 10:46:05	 > 	synth (~4synth]@unaffiliated/synth) has joined #gamingonlinux
2016-03-18 10:46:29	gnarface	i mean if the frames are similar enough to be a good case for your encoding, sure it'll not cost much more bandwidth, but any actually high-activity scene with a 60fps source could theoretically double the bandwidth over 30fps...
2016-03-18 10:46:53	Raven67854	In theory yes
2016-03-18 10:47:00	Raven67854	But generally speaking no
2016-03-18 10:47:12	gnarface	in practice its usually still 75% more or so, unless you're talking about anime
2016-03-18 10:47:30	Raven67854	Still not an issue
2016-03-18 10:47:32	Smilex	it looks a lot smoother. Which is obvious in hindsight
2016-03-18 10:47:56	Raven67854	I have 1gbit up and a monster 8 core
2016-03-18 10:48:23	Smilex	Raven67854: jeez
2016-03-18 10:48:35	Raven67854	No transcoding though. So anything I stream to hitbox gets sent out at whatever I send it at =/
2016-03-18 10:48:48	Raven67854	So I'm sticking with around 3000 bitrate atm
2016-03-18 10:49:06	Smilex	that's probably 1080p?
2016-03-18 10:49:24	Raven67854	720p
2016-03-18 10:49:28	Raven67854	looks pretty good
2016-03-18 10:49:31	Raven67854	Not in fullscreen
2016-03-18 10:49:34	Raven67854	but in the hitbox window
2016-03-18 10:50:06	Smilex	oh. I read that the highest recommended one was 2500
2016-03-18 10:50:25	Smilex	for 720p. I guess higher is just better?
2016-03-18 10:50:26	Raven67854	yeah because if you use 3000 bitrate unless you're a partner you're sending it out at 3000
2016-03-18 10:50:44	Raven67854	But even at 3000.. even people with DSL should watch it fine
2016-03-18 10:50:52	Raven67854	But if you take it to say 8000? Well then you'd start running into issues
2016-03-18 10:51:10	Raven67854	You don't have any quality settings without being a partner. So you shouldn't go to high
2016-03-18 10:51:14	qptain_Nemo	well it's a tradeoff, isn't it? on twitch you'd get several streams but double the delay if not more
2016-03-18 10:51:25	Smilex	Any reason you're using hitbox over twitch?
2016-03-18 10:51:25	Raven67854	qptain_Nemo, Twitch only does that for partners
2016-03-18 10:51:50	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: and they pull it off without increasing the delay significantly?
2016-03-18 10:51:52	Raven67854	Smilex, Twitch people are assholes who ban games for stupid fucking reasons

2016-03-18 10:52:26	Raven67854	Oh no there's an option for it :D
2016-03-18 10:52:36	Raven67854	about 3 second delay at most when I streamed earlier was awesome
2016-03-18 10:52:52	qptain_Nemo	yeah but i mean with transcoding
2016-03-18 10:52:56	Raven67854	Delay
2016-03-18 10:52:57	Smilex	Raven67854: is that an option in OBS or hitbox.tv website?
2016-03-18 10:52:58	Raven67854	Probably quite high
2016-03-18 10:53:01	gnarface	qptain_Nemo: hitbox isn't twitch, that's about the only reason to use it, but its a decent reason enough
2016-03-18 10:53:01	Smilex	the delay
2016-03-18 10:53:01	qptain_Nemo	right
2016-03-18 10:53:03	Raven67854	Smilex, Hitbox website
2016-03-18 10:53:17	Raven67854	Probably just like twitch 1-2m at most
2016-03-18 10:53:24	Smilex	gnarface: I haven't started yet, but I'm thinking Hitbox because they are underdogs
2016-03-18 10:53:36	Raven67854	Twitch for examples allows GTA V but bans Hatred
2016-03-18 10:53:42	Raven67854	Because Hatred is bad
2016-03-18 10:53:46	qptain_Nemo	lol
2016-03-18 10:53:49	Raven67854	But you can do the same thing in GTA V
2016-03-18 10:54:01	Smilex	The whole Hatred thing was dumb
2016-03-18 10:54:16	Raven67854	Lots of games on Twitch are banned for no good reason
2016-03-18 10:54:17	Raven67854	So fuck them
2016-03-18 10:54:22	Raven67854	Also hitbox has a black theme
2016-03-18 10:54:24	Smilex	Raven67854: Which "CPU Usage Preset" do you use in OBS?
2016-03-18 10:54:27	Raven67854	I like dark themes because pure white sucks
2016-03-18 10:54:29	gnarface	Smilex: well they also supposedly have fixed the high delay issue which plauges twitch streams, and there's a good argument to be made that since twitch is so crowded, you have a better chance of getting "noticed" in hitbox right now because its a smaller market
2016-03-18 10:54:38	qptain_Nemo	Raven67854: agreed about white
2016-03-18 10:54:56	Raven67854	gnarface, Yeah its still noticeable though! But the super big partners don't have that issue so that's great for them.
2016-03-18 10:55:00	Raven67854	Smilex, I use my GPU
2016-03-18 10:55:14	Smilex	Raven67854: nvenc ?
2016-03-18 10:55:16	Raven67854	Yes
2016-03-18 10:55:24	stqn	indeed white background around the videos is like saying "oh you wanted to actually see the video? sorry! we never thought about that" …
2016-03-18 10:55:32	Smilex	gnarface: I guess getting noticed is valuable for some
2016-03-18 10:55:44	gnarface	Raven67854: i still can't get h264 streaming across my lan to happen with much lower latency; a problem i don't have with mpeg4 for some reason
2016-03-18 10:55:47	stqn	that’s why youtube has white everywhere

2016-03-18 10:57:38	Raven67854	I do not
2016-03-18 10:57:52	Raven67854	I'll probably move to it. And make it use my build of FFMPEG

2016-03-18 10:59:55	Raven67854	No different
2016-03-18 10:59:59	Raven67854	in terms of performance
2016-03-18 11:00:39	Smilex	I figured OBS doesn't show some of the options ffmpeg offers
2016-03-18 11:02:56	gnarface	i can't imagine how it could.  the ffmpeg manpage doesn't even show all the options ffmpeg offers
2016-03-18 11:03:37	Raven67854	OBS shows what you need

2016-03-18 11:04:16	Smilex	Maybe I can find some ubuntu PPA. I failed compiling ffmpeg from source

2016-03-18 11:05:05	Raven67854	what?

2016-03-18 11:40:17	homerj	I play games I already played once in English in French
2016-03-18 11:40:27	Raven67854	stqn, Why won't you play it in MP?
2016-03-18 11:40:29	homerj	helps with the listening comprehension
2016-03-18 11:41:19	stqn	Raven67854: because it requires having a friend who wants to play it at the same time as me and many other things that won’t happen.
2016-03-18 11:41:24	homerj	although Borderlands 2 does this, and a couple other games, it assumes if you pick French as a language, also assumes you have an azerty keyboard and screws up the mappings
2016-03-18 11:41:34	Raven67854	stqn, Yeah but all you need is 1 person around :P

2016-03-18 11:46:07	homerj	well hell, I pasted the layout, you can look at it
2016-03-18 11:46:25	stqn	Raven67854: well they managed to screw up key bindings anyway… :-/
2016-03-18 11:46:26	Raven67854	Just a pain in the ass supporting localization. Though I don't get why any dev would map localization and fuck up keymapping
2016-03-18 11:46:38	Raven67854	That's just weird
2016-03-18 11:46:49	homerj	it happens a lot

2016-03-18 11:48:17	stqn	(ok, maybe one hand)
2016-03-18 11:48:19	homerj	I find it odd that é from an us-international and a eurkey layout are actually two different characters

2016-03-18 11:49:34	stqn	homerj: probably the same, but broken games break when you have to press two keys to produce the character
2016-03-18 11:50:10	homerj	stqn, I mean just input
2016-03-18 11:50:45	homerj	if I type in an accented chracter in memrise(from a browser) it will say I misspelled a word
2016-03-18 11:50:51	homerj	but not with eurkey
2016-03-18 11:51:05	homerj	so from a javascript standpoint, they are different characters
2016-03-18 11:52:02	homerj	I think the us-international one is some goofy unicode thing, and the eurkey is the actual character
2016-03-18 11:52:02	stqn	I don't know what memrise is
2016-03-18 11:52:08	homerj	flashcard website
2016-03-18 11:52:14	homerj	use it to learn vocabulary
2016-03-18 11:52:42	homerj	unicode does some goofy stuff with accents if you let it
2016-03-18 11:52:54	homerj	where the accent and character are actually different letters
2016-03-18 11:53:12	homerj	and if you support unicode, it knows how to render it "correctly"
2016-03-18 11:53:45	homerj	there's a straight é, and then there's an e, an accent character, and then a code to say "render that over the last character"

2016-03-18 14:26:54	lemony	yepla: just a reminder
2016-03-18 14:27:03	lemony	your laptop can be ultra portable
2016-03-18 14:27:09	lemony	:aka great battery life shitty performance
2016-03-18 14:27:22	lemony	or: be ultra powerful, not portable at all
2016-03-18 14:27:26	lemony	and have shitty battery life
2016-03-18 14:27:31	lemony	or have something in the middle like mine
2016-03-18 14:27:50	lemony	which runs most (by this I mean anything that doesnt need a dedicated gpu) pretty well
2016-03-18 14:28:03	lemony	its a mbp mdn 101
2016-03-18 14:29:02	lemony	it really does depend what you want to do. You can get a laptop as your primary work machine and build a cheapp desktop with older generation tech. you don't need the latest and greatest. im still running third generation i7s though my GPU is the gtx 960

2016-03-18 14:34:16	stqn	yeah I really recommend a desktop for gaming if possible
2016-03-18 14:34:26	lemony	^
2016-03-18 14:34:32	stqn	and some cheap lightweight laptop if needed
2016-03-18 14:34:50	lemony	separate your work machine from your "pleasure" machine
2016-03-18 14:34:51	stqn	but I guess in some cases it’s not convenient
2016-03-18 14:34:53	lemony	phrasing
2016-03-18 14:35:11	lemony	stqn, idk man most people assume you need a dedicated GPU for games
2016-03-18 14:35:27	stqn	well it’s true for heavy 3D games
2016-03-18 14:35:31	lemony	which aint really true if all you play is lol, dota and cs:go
2016-03-18 14:35:35	lemony	well yeah
2016-03-18 14:35:44	stqn	yeah, it depends.
2016-03-18 14:35:51	lemony	pretty much.
2016-03-18 14:36:08	lemony	idk why people slag of mac. Their OS is a bit pants on head stupid sure but their hardware is pretty good
2016-03-18 14:36:20	stqn	I had a 1st gen  i3  for 3 years, and playing with it was a bit of a pain. Many games didn’t work or were super slow.
2016-03-18 14:36:22	lemony	had a similar specced lenovo. gave me maybe an hr of battery life?
2016-03-18 14:36:44	lemony	stqn, i was lucky that way. Someone just threw a 3770K at me 2 years ago for free
2016-03-18 14:36:44	lemony	lol
2016-03-18 14:36:47	stqn	I mean I didn’t have a dedicated GPU, just the i3 iGPU.
2016-03-18 14:36:52	lemony	oh god
2016-03-18 14:37:19	stqn	most 2D games were fine (not all), but 3D… not ideal :)
2016-03-18 14:37:43	*	lemony shrugs
2016-03-18 14:37:52	lemony	I can play borderlands just fine on an intel hd4000
2016-03-18 14:37:54	stqn	when I got my GTX 660 to play Metro Last Light… it was a breath of fresh air :)
2016-03-18 14:37:56	lemony	and cs:GO
2016-03-18 14:38:06	lemony	and galac civ 3
2016-03-18 14:38:16	stqn	I think intel made a lot of progress since the 1st gen
2016-03-18 14:38:21	lemony	they really have
2016-03-18 14:39:32	stqn	lucky you for getting a 3rd gen i7 for free :)
2016-03-18 14:39:38	stqn	I gave my i3 to my niece…
2016-03-18 14:39:52	lemony	lol well my brother basically earns 2x his salary
2016-03-18 14:40:10	lemony	everytime he flies over to Qatar for Fifa's shitty network
2016-03-18 14:40:52	lemony	he buys me my shiney things lol, indian import taxes are fucked up
2016-03-18 14:41:05	lemony	he recently dropped of a 5400 dpi mouse :D
2016-03-18 14:41:16	stqn	sounds overkill ;)
2016-03-18 14:41:22	lemony	ikr?
2016-03-18 14:41:31	lemony	he has these sweet bluetooth head phones too
2016-03-18 14:41:41	lemony	some gaming comapy
2016-03-18 14:42:04	stqn	my Roccat Savu can do … err… I don’t know. I have it at 1600 DPI, or 400 DPI when I press some button.
2016-03-18 14:42:23	lemony	yeah this mouse has that too
2016-03-18 14:42:37	lemony	goes from 1000 to 2000 to OMG WHY IS THE MOUSE POINTER NEXT DOOR!?
2016-03-18 14:42:45	stqn	:)
2016-03-18 14:43:09	stqn	It’s useful with some broken games like Dreamfall chapters
2016-03-18 14:43:17	lemony	broken? how so
2016-03-18 14:43:28	stqn	even at 1600 DPI and maximum mouse sensivity it’s still slow
2016-03-18 14:43:44	gnarface	so anyone up for civ5 yet?
2016-03-18 14:43:47	stqn	eh
2016-03-18 14:43:57	stqn	civ 5 is too slow for me
2016-03-18 14:44:00	stqn	and boring
2016-03-18 14:44:06	stqn	(at least in single player)
2016-03-18 14:44:20	lemony	gnarface, galac civ 3?
2016-03-18 14:44:23	lemony	:P
2016-03-18 14:44:37	lemony	I kid. if someone can help me compile ffmpeg and x265 for android
2016-03-18 14:44:39	lemony	life would be amazing
2016-03-18 14:44:39	gnarface	i like it multiplayer, co-op high difficulty
2016-03-18 14:45:00	lemony	never played civ 5 mp
2016-03-18 14:45:17	gnarface	lemony: i've not compiled ffmpeg for a long time but usually the trick is you have to build and link against the library versions inside the subdirectories of the source tree, not the "distro" one
2016-03-18 14:45:32	lemony	gnarface, thats what Ive done
2016-03-18 14:45:38	gnarface	so what goes wrong?
2016-03-18 14:45:41	lemony	ive got x265 and x264 compiled as static libraries
2016-03-18 14:46:00	lemony	and managed to install them into the android ndk oolchains/x86-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/user
2016-03-18 14:46:24	gnarface	i never once had to install them that i recall, i think i just statically linked against them
2016-03-18 14:46:32	gnarface	android is foreign to me though
2016-03-18 14:46:43	lemony	ffmpeg complains that it cannot find x265 even though ive set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
2016-03-18 14:46:54	stqn	x265 sucks anyway ;)
2016-03-18 14:47:03	lemony	tell that to my clients
2016-03-18 14:47:10	stqn	sure, give me their emails
2016-03-18 14:47:14	stqn	:D
2016-03-18 14:47:15	lemony	ive stopped them from building a custom compression codec
2016-03-18 14:47:34	lemony	which is nice
2016-03-18 14:48:14	lemony	gnarface, android ain't too bad. just need to use their tool chain
2016-03-18 14:48:25	lemony	but linking is where I am going wrong
2016-03-18 14:48:49	lemony	essentially the build is trying to link x265 from a non standard install location but it fails when trying to link the library
2016-03-18 14:49:02	lemony	even though everything is where it's supposed to be
2016-03-18 14:50:44	gnarface	wait PKG_CONFIG_PATH?
2016-03-18 14:50:49	lemony	yes
2016-03-18 14:50:53	gnarface	don't you have to set a different one?
2016-03-18 14:50:56	gnarface	-L
2016-03-18 14:51:03	gnarface	or LD_LIBRARY_PATH?
2016-03-18 14:51:09	lemony	noooo?
2016-03-18 14:51:24	gnarface	i thought it actually tried to link from the build directory
2016-03-18 14:51:39	gnarface	i guess that was version 0.5 though, who knows what they're doing now
2016-03-18 14:52:22	lemony	well
2016-03-18 14:52:27	lemony	im trying to compile ffmpeg 3.0
2016-03-18 14:52:40	lemony	I guess I was supposed to compile all static libs to a build folder
2016-03-18 14:52:47	lemony	and link off that.
2016-03-18 14:53:56	gnarface	yes, that is how i remember doing it, more or less
2016-03-18 14:54:31	gnarface	i was unable to succeed at dynamic linking of the libraries for which they include source in the ffmpeg tree
2016-03-18 14:55:08	gnarface	it ended up being for the best, because their versions would probably have broken a dozen other a/v utils on the system
2016-03-18 14:55:16	lemony	well Ive got the libraries I need coming in as git submodules. No issues compiling those
2016-03-18 14:55:25	lemony	ffmpeg a per usual is just being a cunt
2016-03-18 14:55:35	lemony	or im being retarded
2016-03-18 14:55:36	lemony	or both
2016-03-18 14:56:06	gnarface	building ffmpeg was never easy or straightforward
2016-03-18 14:56:25	gnarface	its kindof known for being a mess
2016-03-18 14:56:45	lemony	i know
2016-03-18 14:56:52	lemony	had the same issues when i was working at Sony
2016-03-18 14:57:38	lemony	at least Ive not tried compiling YASM and freetype2 along with
2016-03-18 14:57:43	lemony	those were just a nightmare to config
2016-03-18 14:57:47	gnarface	hehe
2016-03-18 15:00:38	lemony	"ERROR: x265 not found using pkg-config"
2016-03-18 15:00:40	*	lemony rages
2016-03-18 15:00:59	gnarface	can't you override the path with ./configure?
2016-03-18 15:01:19	lemony	well the error message is a shit error message
2016-03-18 15:01:27	lemony	config.log says " Objective-C compiler not installed on this system"
2016-03-18 15:01:41	lemony	and thus fails to link x265
2016-03-18 15:01:50	lemony	at least Im on the right track.

2016-03-18 15:34:11	stqn	I hate visual novels so much

2016-03-18 15:36:19	homerj	yeah, there's a set formula for them
2016-03-18 15:36:35	homerj	but there's a metric shitton of them
2016-03-18 15:36:55	homerj	there's some program that generates them
2016-03-18 15:37:18	homerj	figure one person to recolor some assets, another to write a cliché story
2016-03-18 15:37:27	homerj	toss it on steam for $10, make cash
2016-03-18 15:39:27	stqn	lol
2016-03-18 15:39:37	stqn	apparently many people like them…
2016-03-18 15:40:27	stqn	I wouldn't hate them so much there there were actual choices to make (with consequences) and if I didn’t have to click to read each 10 words sentence
2016-03-18 15:40:47	BTRE	That's the thing though
2016-03-18 15:40:49	kkit	are they even pornographic?
2016-03-18 15:41:02	kkit	if not, what the hell is the point? match 3?
2016-03-18 15:41:02	BTRE	there actually are visual novels with choices that matter that aren't just wish fulfillment fantasies
2016-03-18 15:41:33	BTRE	the thing is that the ones that pander are easy to make and drown them out.
2016-03-18 15:42:15	BTRE	Stuff like Danganronpa and the Phoenix Wright series are visual novels and have gameplay too (investigating)
2016-03-18 15:42:19	gnarface	so, civ5 anyone?
2016-03-18 15:42:51	stqn	but then if it’s called "visual novel" it means (or should mean) that there is no gameplay
2016-03-18 15:43:07	stqn	if there are choices then it’s a "choose your own adventure" game…
2016-03-18 15:43:13	BTRE	Not really. It's just a broad label.
2016-03-18 15:43:20	stqn	yeah, unfortunately…
2016-03-18 15:44:19	BTRE	There are subclassificiations but people just lump 'em all together.
2016-03-18 15:44:54	stqn	and "to the moon" which is supposed to be a point & click is the worst visual novel I’ve ever played
2016-03-18 15:45:11	BTRE	Mmm, haven't played that yet despite having it in my library
2016-03-18 15:45:55	stqn	read 3 words, click, read 4 words, click, read 2 words, click…
2016-03-18 15:46:46	BTRE	Well, I like reading, so I'll forgive them if the story is at least good.
2016-03-18 15:47:10	stqn	I don’t mind reading, I mind having to click to read 3 words
2016-03-18 15:47:11	BTRE	That's probably not the case for 90% of the stuff on steam though

2016-03-18 15:49:16	stqn	anyway… still got Metro Last Light to finish :)
2016-03-18 15:50:05	stqn	I can’t say that the story is good, because it's quite confusing, but at least the gameplay is good.
2016-03-18 15:50:20	BTRE	I'm sure that the novels make more sense

2016-03-19 08:44:02	@Samsai	yes
2016-03-19 08:44:39	Smilex	is it about getting paid for being a citizen?
2016-03-19 08:44:43	@Samsai	yes
2016-03-19 08:44:53	@Samsai	it basically replaces the normal benefit system
2016-03-19 08:45:06	gkeen_	you get 800 euros just for being member in a country

2016-03-19 08:46:47	@Samsai	if you make enough money you basically pay the citizen salary back to state in the form of taxes, but the idea is that you can work without risking your benefits

2016-03-19 08:49:29	@Samsai	i might have to edit a highlight of it

2016-03-19 09:22:25	mirv_	KMS support - so it'll be using amdgpu
2016-03-19 09:22:33	GolBot	[NEWS] AMD release the AMD GPU-PRO Beta Driver with Vulkan support for Linux http://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/amd-release-the-amd-gpu-pro-beta-driver-with-vulkan-support-for-linux.6847 - Fri, 18 Mar 2016 22:19:22
2016-03-19 09:22:42	@Samsai	mirv_, i do still expect them to release AMDGPU blobs for modern GCN 1.0 cards
2016-03-19 09:22:59	mirv_	Samsai, don't count on that
2016-03-19 09:23:19	mirv_	they said "maybe" for anything pre-tonga
2016-03-19 09:23:49	@Samsai	i'm not relying on their promises, i'm relying on their consumer-friendliness
2016-03-19 09:24:54	mirv_	point is that we don't need to rely on amdgpu at all - if you're on radeonsi, you'll get everything...eventually
2016-03-19 09:28:02	mirv_	essentially amdgpu gives you access to amd's userland blob - and that's not aimed at gaming
2016-03-19 09:28:18	@NaughtySquid	hope to see a talos benchmark soons
2016-03-19 09:28:19	dis_	NaughtySquid: for now. GCN 1.1 is confirmed to be coming
2016-03-19 09:29:35	@Samsai	mirv_, i've gotten a different picture from an AMD dev
2016-03-19 09:29:54	@Samsai	they still want to ship their opengl as the go-to gaming component on top of AMDGPU
2016-03-19 09:30:13	mirv_	interesting
2016-03-19 09:30:48	mirv_	well in that case, yeah amdgpu will need to be at least gcn 1.1
2016-03-19 09:31:34	@NaughtySquid	holy crap

2016-03-19 10:46:03	gnarface	Marezz: i think the game gets crashy when the network destabilizes
2016-03-19 10:46:29	Marezz	it appears so, i had problems only at the beginning, afterwards it went smooth
2016-03-19 10:46:52	gnarface	at some point i think i'm probably gonna set up a VPN just for playing Civ5 in LAN mode so that doesn't happen
2016-03-19 10:47:18	Marezz	steam should just fix their shit >.<
2016-03-19 10:49:39	gnarface	i agree
2016-03-19 10:50:07	gnarface	there's few things more annoying than being disconnected from a Civ5 game in-progress, because the computer AI takes over for you, and goes into turtle mode
2016-03-19 10:50:38	gnarface	(cancels all war/combat and retreates all your units into your own territory and stops expanding anything, goes fully on passive mode)
2016-03-19 10:51:02	gnarface	early in the game that happened to you but its not as big of a deal when you're not already at war and only have 1 unit and 1 city
2016-03-19 10:51:15	gnarface	when you have a lot of cities and battles going on it can really hose you
2016-03-19 10:51:37	gnarface	of course it helps that i didn't take my turn and let it take its turn without you
2016-03-19 10:51:57	gnarface	if you're in a game where the other players just keep playing without you, you can lose some turns to the AI
2016-03-19 10:52:17	Marezz	Tomorrow we invade that Ottoman peasant! No one enters my domain without my permission! :D
2016-03-19 10:52:28	gnarface	but, my theory is that a proper vpn setup would make the connection much more latency-tolerant

2016-03-19 11:11:42	gnarface	that's optional, but i thought it would make it more interesting
2016-03-19 11:12:01	Marezz	Oh, so that was your doing.. XD
2016-03-19 11:12:25	gnarface	yea, but also it puts some pressure on the computer AI so they have something to keep them busy other than attacking us
2016-03-19 11:12:28	Marezz	Catapults stay in main city?
2016-03-19 11:12:51	gnarface	they don't have to, they're movable units like any other military unit, but they're very weak to melee attacks
2016-03-19 11:13:00	Marezz	oh
2016-03-19 11:13:10	Marezz	for some reason i didnt see my catapult anywhere
2016-03-19 11:13:15	gnarface	so its a good idea to keep them in a city, or at least surrounded by military units
2016-03-19 11:13:55	gnarface	hmm. next time we'll play i we should look.  it should have appeared in your city, but if you had another military unit there already, it would have been stacked, and you'd have to move one or the other out of the city before you could do anything else with either of them
2016-03-19 11:14:11	Marezz	possibly
2016-03-19 11:14:14	gnarface	you can only have 1 land and 1 naval military unit in a city at a time

2016-03-19 12:32:10	openfbtd	But Gawker is one of the most horrible journalistic outlets there ever was
2016-03-19 12:32:39	openfbtd	Some gamers specifically are really fucking pissed at them for what they did on the dawn of gamergate
2016-03-19 12:32:44	kkit	"the fappening is bad, football player's dick pics are good!"
2016-03-19 12:32:51	openfbtd	“Gamers are dead” and stuff
2016-03-19 12:33:08	openfbtd	They've been slandering gamergaters for two fucking years.
2016-03-19 12:33:33	openfbtd	Labeling perfectly fine people with every bad word they could find in the dictionary
2016-03-19 12:33:57	kkit	i don't even know what the sides are, both sound kind of toxic at this point
2016-03-19 12:34:42	kkit	it seemed like a lot of "people on the internet are a bunch of major assholes"
2016-03-19 12:34:58	openfbtd	If GG sounds toxic, then Kotaku have done their job.
2016-03-19 12:35:05	Smilex	I guess everyone loves the Gawker thing

2016-03-19 12:35:43	kkit	is that what it was?
2016-03-19 12:35:56	Smilex	kkit: No. It was a mess
2016-03-19 12:36:24	openfbtd	Well obviously it was a mess. But the core engine of the movement is corrupt gaming media
2016-03-19 12:36:37	openfbtd	Or, rather, their actions
2016-03-19 12:37:17	openfbtd	It sure as hell isn't a coordinated attack on women in gaming
2016-03-19 12:37:30	kkit	it sounds like a pile of internet drama i'm happy to have known little about
2016-03-19 12:37:32	Smilex	I unfortunately was part of the flames, because I was angry about trusting the reviewers as a teenager and buying stuff that I regretted. However I admit that I also enabled a lot of people who have ideas I'm pretty sure I don't agree with
2016-03-19 12:37:50	kkit	oh sure, shit like ign scores have been a joke forever
2016-03-19 12:38:28	openfbtd	In any case, unethical gaming media can burn in hell, and Gawker is one of the worst offenders there through Kotaku
2016-03-19 12:38:41	Smilex	Don't know if it was IGN specifically. But it all resulted in me buying a Xbox 360, which I really shouldn't have
2016-03-19 12:38:45	kkit	gawker is just trash in general
2016-03-19 12:39:04	openfbtd	Even if the finishing blow didn't come from gamers (it would probably have not happened anyway), it would be good if they die.
2016-03-19 12:39:27	kkit	is having your likeness in a video game close enough?
2016-03-19 12:39:27	openfbtd	IGN is a social justice outlet these days
2016-03-19 12:39:52	openfbtd	“the protagonist is a white male 1/10”
2016-03-19 12:40:55	openfbtd	They are not the only ones though. Almost all the big gaming media outlets are so concerned with the SJ bubble, they completely forgot to actually report on games
2016-03-19 12:41:29	kkit	they turned into tumblrinas?
2016-03-19 12:41:46	openfbtd	Pretty much. And long before gamergate happened btw.
2016-03-19 12:42:06	openfbtd	The SJ narrative in gaming media have been brewing for a long time

2016-03-19 12:45:36	openfbtd	And for pushing a political agenda when you're dressing it as a game review
2016-03-19 12:45:57	openfbtd	Sure, go ahead and do it. No one can stop you.
2016-03-19 12:46:07	openfbtd	I don't wish anyone could.
2016-03-19 12:46:35	Smilex	but that's what Gamergate became. Very much set on stopping them

2016-03-19 12:47:33	openfbtd	Smilex, I'm reading KiA, and people mock and report, not going to the UN to try to forbid media from saying stuff.
2016-03-19 12:48:14	openfbtd	The general attitude that I see is “surem you can say this and that. Fuck you.”
2016-03-19 12:48:15	Smilex	I read 8chan. They definetly tried to get the government to act
2016-03-19 12:48:23	openfbtd	Well that's stupid
2016-03-19 12:49:27	openfbtd	I can sort of understand people for turning to the government out of desperation, but that's not going to work and undermines the whole point
2016-03-19 12:49:29	Smilex	of course it is. People aren't angry enough about games journalism to form something as large as gamergate.

2016-03-19 12:51:22	openfbtd	It's just that there is a pretty substantial part of GG that is tired of doing nothing

2016-03-19 12:52:08	openfbtd	They attack both sides indiscriminately

2016-03-19 12:54:28	dabblers-buffet	I was thinking of this experimental idea, storing RAM modules in tinfoil. XD

2016-03-19 12:55:40	openfbtd	But then the major GG gathering places consistently tell ayy-teamers to go fuck off in a corner
2016-03-19 12:56:21	openfbtd	Another but: the shitty gaming media reports their actions as GG actions anyway
2016-03-19 12:56:54	openfbtd	With either no research or just discarding the small insignificant detail that the people they report on are pretty well known trolls

2016-03-19 13:03:45	openfbtd	That means I dislike the fact that KiA supported it

2016-03-19 13:04:49	dabblers-buffet	I haven't seen anything yet in VR.
2016-03-19 13:04:53	dabblers-buffet	It's the hype right now.
2016-03-19 13:04:59	openfbtd	stqn, people who tried ViVe are super fucking hyped
2016-03-19 13:04:59	dabblers-buffet	Anything interesting I mean.
2016-03-19 13:05:00	stqn	dabblers-buffet: I should have been blown away!!!!!! but it’s just crap.
2016-03-19 13:05:17	openfbtd	I can't justify spending money on it yet
2016-03-19 13:05:33	dabblers-buffet	I expected more than 3D when it came to VR, like you would actually have everything pop out at you 3D.
2016-03-19 13:05:36	dabblers-buffet	Or maybe 4D!
2016-03-19 13:05:37	Smilex	openfbtd: The point is that you count as one in the group called KiA, and whenever KiA does something, it sure looks like you do something, meaning you are part of it and enabling it. This is just about everything I'll say about the subject, because it's too personal and nothing good will come of it
2016-03-19 13:06:00	stqn	dabblers-buffet: it’s supposed to immerse you, but an immersive game is a first person game, and these don’t work with VR.
2016-03-19 13:06:20	dabblers-buffet	Yeah.
2016-03-19 13:06:21	openfbtd	I mean it's insanely cool to finally be able to look around in a fully 3D enviroment
2016-03-19 13:06:26	Smilex	Flying games worked the best with oculus in my experience
2016-03-19 13:06:29	openfbtd	stqn, shooting galleries work
2016-03-19 13:06:34	openfbtd	Also simulators
2016-03-19 13:06:45	dabblers-buffet	There's a VR game I think called Eve Valkyrie.
2016-03-19 13:06:54	dabblers-buffet	Although that's like an RPG game in space.
2016-03-19 13:06:59	dabblers-buffet	Not really first person is it?
2016-03-19 13:07:24	stqn	Smilex: yes, I guess, flying simulators, space sims and maybe racing sims in first person view…
2016-03-19 13:07:28	openfbtd	Still. It's all really cool, but not for $1000 and another $2500 for a PC
2016-03-19 13:07:29	openfbtd	:D
2016-03-19 13:07:32	stqn	but I don’t like those.
2016-03-19 13:07:42	dabblers-buffet	There are like so many VR devices out right now, HTC Vive, Google Cardboard VR, PlayStationVR, Oculus Rift, etc...
2016-03-19 13:07:47	dabblers-buffet	I'm fine with 2D gaming for now.
2016-03-19 13:07:49	openfbtd	And pretty much a few dozen games
2016-03-19 13:07:51	Smilex	stqn: that's not fair. You haven't tried them with the new input method (VR)
2016-03-19 13:08:00	dabblers-buffet	You guys know that 3D TV's are actually a dead subject?
2016-03-19 13:08:17	Smilex	stqn: also it'll be in the future. What do you know about the future
2016-03-19 13:08:24	stqn	Smilex: you may have a point.
2016-03-19 13:08:31	dabblers-buffet	Nobody's really talked about them anymore.
2016-03-19 13:08:50	openfbtd	3D TVs didn't really take off too well
2016-03-19 13:08:58	dabblers-buffet	How did they fail?
2016-03-19 13:09:06	dabblers-buffet	Was it the 4K resolutions on TVs?
2016-03-19 13:09:09	stqn	yesterday I watched the trailer for playstation VR, it showed only dumb minigames… ridiculous
2016-03-19 13:09:11	dabblers-buffet	& the Smart TVs as well?
2016-03-19 13:09:18	openfbtd	Basically people don't buy them

2016-03-19 13:10:02	openfbtd	I mean people do buy them, it's just not THE NEXT BIG THING, like we were told a few years ago
2016-03-19 13:10:20	dabblers-buffet	Like where you could actually feel things like water, etc...
2016-03-19 13:10:23	dabblers-buffet	That'd be awesome.
2016-03-19 13:10:24	openfbtd	VR headsets are probably actually the next big thing

2016-03-19 13:11:44	dabblers-buffet	Like for instance, let's say if you played like a very realistic 3D survival game but yet you could feel the major vibrations that you just fall down, that you slip.
2016-03-19 13:11:57	dabblers-buffet	Or like when you fall off a cliff in a game, & you feel the sudden hard impact.
2016-03-19 13:12:04	Smilex	stqn: Those actually looked fun. But there will also be the massive space game that everyone is expecting to fail
2016-03-19 13:12:08	Smilex	forgot the name
2016-03-19 13:12:19	dabblers-buffet	Or if you're getting attacked by a lion or something & you feel vibrations as well.
2016-03-19 13:12:28	openfbtd	dabblers-buffet, well my dream is a fully 3D envoronment with full sensory feedback

2016-03-19 13:13:05	dabblers-buffet	Soon?
2016-03-19 13:13:11	openfbtd	Probably not in my life

2016-03-19 13:13:26	stqn	I want to be immersed in games… but not dumb minigames… games like skyrim or mirror’s edge or fallout
2016-03-19 13:13:27	dabblers-buffet	That'd be close to imitating reality.
2016-03-19 13:13:33	dabblers-buffet	XD.
2016-03-19 13:13:47	dabblers-buffet	stqn: Yeah, what dumb minigames did they show?
2016-03-19 13:14:02	stqn	dabblers-buffet: I posted the link to the video

2016-03-19 13:14:32	dabblers-buffet	Did video games back then ever used to be about quality?
2016-03-19 13:14:37	dabblers-buffet	Not making a quick buck?
2016-03-19 13:14:53	openfbtd	A shooter where you can actually disable someone by shooting out their kneecaps?

2016-03-19 13:14:58	Smilex	I won't be getting VR until I can rent it. Try the stuff and then return it

2016-03-19 13:15:23	dabblers-buffet	I have never tried VR before at all.

2016-03-19 13:15:47	openfbtd	So PK with full loot in true VR.
2016-03-19 13:15:48	Smilex	Or pay quite a bit to play in a arcade-like setting. VR driving games with driver's seats that have hydralics, etc.
2016-03-19 13:15:49	dabblers-buffet	openfbtd: That'd be awesome!
2016-03-19 13:16:04	openfbtd	With full sensory feedback
2016-03-19 13:16:11	stqn	dabblers-buffet: I think most video game authors "back then" and now love video games and want to make them… it’s not really about the money, and it’s certainly not a quick and guarranted way to earn money
2016-03-19 13:16:26	openfbtd	Imagine the media going insane when a full VR game features torture?
2016-03-19 13:16:36	openfbtd	Delicious
2016-03-19 13:16:56	Smilex	I tried torture in a safe environment. It's actually amazingly effective
2016-03-19 13:17:03	dabblers-buffet	Imagine this whole thing, ACTUAL VR with close to human features, you can smell stuff inside the game, hear it, feel it, see it, & more all realistically.
2016-03-19 13:17:16	dabblers-buffet	That'd be WAY past 3D.
2016-03-19 13:17:16	openfbtd	Or, even better, crying about a VR game that just doesn't stop you from inflicting pain on other players
2016-03-19 13:17:39	Smilex	I tried the thing where you get a cloth on your face, and someone spills water pretty slowly onto it, while you are held down

2016-03-19 13:42:48	openfbtd	But basically just go to youtube and watch gameplay videos of a game you're interested in
2016-03-19 13:43:08	openfbtd	It should tell you much more than reviews from fake journalists on gaming sites

2016-03-19 20:04:21	baizon	DerRidda: when you have a chat window open, do you also see it in the alt-tab switcher?
2016-03-19 20:04:52	DerRidda	I do.
2016-03-19 20:05:03	DerRidda	Grouped under the Steam icon.
2016-03-19 20:05:03	baizon	when you only have 1 chat window open?
2016-03-19 20:05:17	DerRidda	And no other Steam window at all?
2016-03-19 20:05:18	baizon	i mean only 1 chat window, everything else is closed
2016-03-19 20:05:20	baizon	yes
2016-03-19 20:05:47	baizon	hmm its a bug for me
2016-03-19 20:06:09	DerRidda	Yes, but I also still see the main window as it only minimzes on pressing its own close button.

2016-03-19 20:06:45	baizon	then close it
2016-03-19 20:06:46	DerRidda	Still there when I close Steam via the Unity close button.

2016-03-20 00:47:11	coeseta	did anyone try to launch borderlands 2 or the pre sequel lately? Because they wont start and steams output on the terminal isn't that helpful
2016-03-20 00:47:45	kkit	coeseta: i was playing bl2 last night just fine on nvidia hardware and nonfree drivers
2016-03-20 00:47:46	qptain_Nemo	yeah borderlands 2 stopped running for me recently but i haven't investigated it further
2016-03-20 00:48:07	coeseta	i am on arch btw kernel 4.4.5 and nvidia driver 361.28
2016-03-20 00:48:11	kkit	if you updated your nvidia drivers and still have the threaded gl launch options, it won't start
2016-03-20 00:48:18	tumocs	works fine with mesa
2016-03-20 00:48:39	tadzik	mesa jar jar binks
2016-03-20 00:48:42	coeseta	oh i see thanks for the hint kkit
2016-03-20 00:48:43	coeseta	:)
2016-03-20 00:49:20	kkit	it'll also break games that have that in their launch scripts, which i think a few VP games might have
2016-03-20 00:49:35	kkit	there's some other launch option that suppresses it for them, but i don't recall what it is
2016-03-20 00:49:38	qptain_Nemo	kkit: uuuhh where do i check that?
2016-03-20 00:49:49	kkit	right-click game title, launch options
2016-03-20 00:50:06	kkit	er, properties, then set launch options
2016-03-20 00:50:20	qptain_Nemo	oh so if that's empty then it's not the case?
2016-03-20 00:50:26	kkit	uh
2016-03-20 00:50:34	kkit	my bl2 launch options are: __GLVND_DISALLOW_PATCHING=1 %command%
2016-03-20 00:51:12	coeseta	__GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=0 %command% fixed the problem for me :>

2016-03-20 00:51:56	qptain_Nemo	wow kkit's options fixed it for me
2016-03-20 00:52:10	qptain_Nemo	how was i supposed to figure that out ? D:
2016-03-20 00:52:16	coeseta	when it is empty then the have __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1  automatically and it wont start
2016-03-20 00:52:40	coeseta	*they
2016-03-20 00:53:46	kkit	qptain_Nemo: read more reddit probably
2016-03-20 00:53:53	qptain_Nemo	heh
2016-03-20 00:53:59	qptain_Nemo	well either way thanks
2016-03-20 00:54:17	qptain_Nemo	i wonder why haven't they fixed this
2016-03-20 00:54:18	kkit	there was a thread in linux_gaming about the new nvidia drivers screwing shit up
2016-03-20 00:54:28	kkit	which explains what they're doing in more detail than i can
2016-03-20 00:54:30	coeseta	might be worth to make a short article on GoL  since it is the case for several games
2016-03-20 00:54:41	coeseta	ye the new driver seems to make a bit of a mess ^^
2016-03-20 00:54:56	kkit	a lot of folks were saying to stick with 358.whatever

2016-03-20 01:10:51	kkit	wtf, how long do i have to wait on indiegamestand for my new account to be allowed to get keys? what kind of idiot restriction is that?
2016-03-20 01:11:07	homerj	yeah, when a game doesn't launch for me now, I stick in the GLVND line
2016-03-20 01:11:25	homerj	and it works, although things seem to be fine, I haven't really done any comparison
2016-03-20 01:11:29	@Samsai	kkit, might be tied to the recent g2a post they had
2016-03-20 01:13:20	@Samsai	homerj, the GLVND line probably doesn't have a huge performance impact either way
2016-03-20 01:14:27	kkit	i lose 25% or so in framerates in bl2
2016-03-20 01:14:38	kkit	it's still above 30 so i'm not tooooo upset

2016-03-20 01:15:52	@Samsai	makes me wonder what nvidia's plan is
2016-03-20 01:16:08	@Samsai	GLVND is fairly straight-forwards, they want to make hybrid graphics easier to do
2016-03-20 01:16:18	@Samsai	but disabling threaded optimizations is a bit odd
2016-03-20 01:16:41	@Samsai	or, well, making the optimizations really buggy
2016-03-20 01:18:10	kkit	the joys of gaming on linux
2016-03-20 01:21:03	homerj	I think the entire thing was a "let's release it now and let everyone sort out the bugs"
2016-03-20 01:24:16	@Samsai	or maybe they have had enough of AMD fans that claim their driver does GL in a non-standard way
2016-03-20 01:24:28	@Samsai	so now they are writing a really strict, non-threaded GL driver

2016-03-20 04:37:01	ky0	found one annoyance so far, hexchat doesn't have a tray icon
2016-03-20 04:37:30	Spl-it	who needs a tray ? ;)
2016-03-20 04:38:25	madmachinations	maybe the tray is elsewhere? On Gnome 3 for me the tray pops out of the bottom left, for reasons.
2016-03-20 04:38:39	madmachinations	but you have to hover over it to see the button that makes it pop out
2016-03-20 04:38:48	ky0	no, it's really not coming
2016-03-20 04:38:51	ky0	but it's fine
2016-03-20 04:39:11	tadzik	I have no need for a tray since I discovered how useful WM urgency is

2016-03-20 07:22:08	Smilex	If I want to cut out things like pulseaudio and systemd from my system, does it make sense to hold onto Ubuntu? Or will it just complicate things
2016-03-20 07:22:46	Mneuro	Smilex why cut out pulseaudio?  It used to be terrible but it's great nowadays
2016-03-20 07:23:06	Smilex	Mneuro: I don't get what it's supposed to be solving
2016-03-20 07:23:36	Mneuro	isn't pulseaudio the reason we can have multiple sounds going to multiple sound devices at the same time?
2016-03-20 07:23:46	Mneuro	for example, game to speakers and voip to headset
2016-03-20 07:24:11	Mneuro	I could be wrong, I was just always under that assumption
2016-03-20 07:24:35	@Samsai	at least it makes it a lot easier
2016-03-20 07:24:39	Smilex	well I've been writing ALSA research code these past two days. let me check
2016-03-20 07:28:56	Smilex	Mneuro: It looks like you are right, if the devs of the software you are using didn't implement it for ALSA
2016-03-20 07:29:11	Mneuro	Smilex, Skype is one of those pieces of software
2016-03-20 07:29:13	Smilex	and here I'm guessing pulseaudio supports it well even if devs didn't think of it
2016-03-20 07:29:26	Smilex	Mneuro: Skype doesn't support JACK?
2016-03-20 07:29:45	mirv_	using apulse works (or at least used to work) with skype
2016-03-20 07:29:52	Mneuro	idk, but when I used to use a distro without pulseaudio, I couldn't get it to send skype to my usb headset while a game was on my speakers
2016-03-20 07:30:25	Mneuro	either way, it's probably possible but pulseaudio makes it easy

2016-03-20 07:35:19	Mneuro	Smilex, not sure.  I've never tried Jack.  Pulse works so i just go with it
2016-03-20 07:35:32	Mneuro	Pulseaudio is amazing.  It was only bad a few years ago because Ubuntu and other adopted it before it was ready
2016-03-20 07:37:21	Smilex	Mneuro: I'm still hearing people getting new issues
2016-03-20 07:37:41	Smilex	though technically it's often about Linux audio, so I can't be sure it's Pulseaudio
2016-03-20 07:37:59	jaycee1980	linux audio.. i wont start...
2016-03-20 07:38:10	Mneuro	Smilex and it's not like alsa was perfect.  If you have to spend half an hour setting something up in alsa, you might as well fix the small bug you get in pulse

2016-03-20 07:41:48	@Samsai	NaughtySquid's multimonitor setup hates him
2016-03-20 07:41:55	jaycee1980	my issues are more about how untidy everything is rather than how it functions
2016-03-20 07:42:17	jaycee1980	so you dont want to deal with the audio api's directly, but rather hide behind things like openal or portaudio
2016-03-20 07:42:44	Smilex	Mneuro: ok it is possible with JACK, but it doesn't look simple. Unfortunate
2016-03-20 07:42:55	Mneuro	Smilex, I'll stick to pulse
2016-03-20 07:43:36	Smilex	Mneuro: Oh sure. As a user you're just in for pain if you don't use pulseaudio
2016-03-20 07:44:08	Mneuro	Smilex, Yea luckily I don't develop software or anything.  I just use pulse to get audio to my speakers.  no need for more
2016-03-20 07:45:17	Smilex	I suspect JACK would be a plus for streamers/youtubers/new medio on Linux. But I don't know the tools they use, so can't be sure
2016-03-20 07:45:39	jaycee1980	its also a latency issue when you have layers on top of layers and no idea whats doing what
2016-03-20 07:45:45	Smilex	however JACK would allow you to easily pass game audio through a different pipeline than say voice audio
2016-03-20 07:45:54	@Samsai	Smilex, except that youtubers/streamers use pulse
2016-03-20 07:46:08	@Samsai	because pulse pretty much does what jack is supposed to do but it's easier to configure

2016-03-20 09:03:50	openfbtd	If people fork things and don't fix problems, then they don't think the problems are worth fixing
2016-03-20 09:03:59	Smilex	I mean, I'm using weechat. And I think it's exactly the same as irssi and maybe hexchat
2016-03-20 09:04:28	openfbtd	Oh, irssi changed their site

2016-03-20 09:06:34	@Samsai	didn't xchat basically die?
2016-03-20 09:06:47	@Samsai	i heard there were no major releases for a while
2016-03-20 09:06:53	openfbtd	xchat is dead tho
2016-03-20 09:07:03	openfbtd	Last release in 2010
2016-03-20 09:07:15	openfbtd	I mean it works, so meh
2016-03-20 09:07:45	openfbtd	It's not like IRC is a moving target needing constant changes to the clients

2016-03-20 09:48:43	@Samsai	it doesn't work on newer mesa
2016-03-20 09:49:17	@Samsai	using it results in huge amounts of glError() messages and you won't get any actual input
2016-03-20 09:50:18	Smilex	Samsai: so how do you get XSHM to capture video at good 720p or 1080p ratios? Do you have a monitor that fits perfectly?
2016-03-20 09:50:39	@Samsai	i manually scale it down when i need 720p windowed
2016-03-20 09:50:58	@Samsai	it's an annoying process
2016-03-20 09:51:12	Smilex	Samsai: scale your resolution, or do you use OBS for it?
2016-03-20 09:51:22	@Samsai	i use OBS for it
2016-03-20 09:51:37	@Samsai	i basically scale the XSHM input until it fits

2016-03-20 22:09:17	Samsai-Laptop	next up is taking it down to minimum
2016-03-20 22:10:11	@NaughtySquid	Samsai-Laptop: i imagine ultra is using features mesa doesnt have yet
2016-03-20 22:10:26	Samsai-Laptop	i dunno
2016-03-20 22:10:38	Samsai-Laptop	i would imagine the engine is fairly similar to grid's
2016-03-20 22:10:45	Samsai-Laptop	and grid can be maxed out just fine
2016-03-20 22:11:15	Samsai-Laptop	also, it should result in a smooth crash as the game should recognize the opengl spec available before attempting to use unsupported extensions
2016-03-20 22:11:27	psppwner300	f1 2015 is advertised as using a brand new engine

2016-03-20 22:30:01	Smilex	doesn't that remove just those that no longer have any dependencies?
2016-03-20 22:30:07	mirv_	yes
2016-03-20 22:30:25	Smilex	Yeah. I'm looking to remove user software that's just sitting there
2016-03-20 22:30:51	mirv_	clean reinstall
2016-03-20 22:31:39	Smilex	I guess removing some library that a lot of packages rely on, and then reinstalling only what's needed would work

2016-03-20 22:41:57	psppwner300	you also deleted your comment
2016-03-20 22:42:18	EddDeDuck	Indeed was kinda obvious
2016-03-20 22:42:34	EddDeDuck	and would just attract abuse / downvotes / quetsions we don’t need to answer

2016-03-20 22:52:23	mirv_	might have bought it eventually anyway
2016-03-20 22:52:49	mirv_	but it's a safe bet I will buy the game sooner now

2016-03-20 23:01:23	Smilex	linux_gamer: bloat
2016-03-20 23:01:32	mirv_	Smilex, for ubuntu, a lot of difficulty I suspect
2016-03-20 23:01:50	mirv_	and you need an init system of some kind
2016-03-20 23:01:54	Smilex	I do use Linux out of ideology, but now that I'm here, I like to use the possiblities offered to customize my system
2016-03-20 23:02:02	Smilex	mirv_: suckless has one
2016-03-20 23:02:39	mirv_	and gentoo has openrc
2016-03-20 23:03:12	Smilex	Yeah there are alternatives. But so far Suckless has blown my mind
2016-03-20 23:03:13	mirv_	doesn't help removing systemd from ubuntu
2016-03-20 23:03:13	linux_gamer	i personally dont touch the kernel or anything lower
2016-03-20 23:03:35	Smilex	all this time they've been there while I was complaining that things should be done the way they were doing it
2016-03-20 23:03:47	mirv_	if you really want to start poking at that kind of thing, I recommend using a different distro
2016-03-20 23:04:20	Smilex	linux_gamer: I love being on the torvalds git, but somehow it's impossible to do with the nvidia blob
2016-03-20 23:04:27	Smilex	I'm not sure who's at fault with that
2016-03-20 23:04:45	Smilex	mirv_: yeah, I'm thinking about switching distro as well
2016-03-20 23:05:01	mirv_	sorry, but I'm not taking a site seriously if says both GCC and Clang suck
2016-03-20 23:05:02	Smilex	but isn't there a bit of value in having the same distro as most Linux users?
2016-03-20 23:05:22	Smilex	mirv_: hah! sure they do
2016-03-20 23:05:32	mirv_	Smilex, I'd argue there's more value in having linux as you want it
2016-03-20 23:05:37	mirv_	not how everyone else wants it
2016-03-20 23:05:41	Smilex	I'm sure they are thinking about the C++ stuff as well
2016-03-20 23:05:46	mirv_	and no, gcc and clang do not suck
2016-03-20 23:05:59	mirv_	C++ itself also does not suck
2016-03-20 23:06:01	Smilex	compiling C code doesn't need as large a project as GCC and Clang are
2016-03-20 23:06:30	linux_gamer	anyone noticed the nvidia driver release cycles? 0day->5th day->8 days later->18days and nothing (also skipped windows release)
2016-03-20 23:06:35	mirv_	GCC stands for "GNU Compiler Collection" - it's far more than just C
2016-03-20 23:06:55	linux_gamer	gcc rules
2016-03-20 23:07:05	Ysblokje	also clang is just a front for llvm
2016-03-20 23:07:21	mirv_	indeed
2016-03-20 23:07:36	Smilex	mirv_: I know. I'm just saying that people like me, who have grown to really despise C++ in all its forms, are not the userbase the GCC and Clang devs are concerned with
2016-03-20 23:07:38	mirv_	GCC is a broad term really, it covers a lot
2016-03-20 23:07:59	mirv_	Smilex, why do you despise C++?
2016-03-20 23:08:09	Ysblokje	go tinyc or something then
2016-03-20 23:08:16	mirv_	I'm not starting wars, I'm just curious as to the reasoning
2016-03-20 23:08:18	psppwner300	it's prone to errors
2016-03-20 23:08:31	mirv_	C++ itself is not
2016-03-20 23:08:38	Smilex	mirv_: It was my first programming language. I used it a lot for quite a bit of time. And being my first, I avidly looked away from any issues. I loved the thing.
2016-03-20 23:08:46	Smilex	But in the end it was just a abusive relationship
2016-03-20 23:09:12	mirv_	then I'd say people are using it one way, but expecting it to behave differently
2016-03-20 23:09:18	mirv_	it's not an OO language
2016-03-20 23:09:27	mirv_	it's C, with objects
2016-03-20 23:10:10	Smilex	mirv_: well not according to the comittee
2016-03-20 23:10:44	Smilex	besides, I was learning and C++ forums/irc/web tutorials all thought me the non-programming paradigm
2016-03-20 23:10:55	Smilex	even school does it

2016-03-20 23:12:24	Smilex	Stroustrup is part of the committee! Also he's one of the worst

2016-03-20 23:13:04	mirv_	seriously? he makes a lot of sense
2016-03-20 23:13:53	Smilex	how many values has he now introduced? theres, l-value, r-value, xvalue, glvalue. Maybe more
2016-03-20 23:14:15	mirv_	and if you don't like them, what forces you to use them?
2016-03-20 23:14:25	Smilex	The whole idea of a class can also get as far as possible from me
2016-03-20 23:14:33	Smilex	and member functions can fuck off
2016-03-20 23:15:01	Smilex	and struct protection (private, public, protected) can piss off
2016-03-20 23:15:09	Smilex	the STL as well
2016-03-20 23:15:21	Smilex	I don't mind 'auto' though
2016-03-20 23:15:25	mirv_	see, they're all actually very useful and powerful things
2016-03-20 23:16:04	mirv_	but again, if you don't want to use them, you're free not to
2016-03-20 23:16:40	Smilex	we are not going to come to an agreement on this. Truth is. Much more larger and impressive in scale projects get done in C++ than in C
2016-03-20 23:17:02	mirv_	indeed
2016-03-20 23:17:04	Smilex	I like the idea that the elegance of C for smaller projects does scale, but there's no certainty to that
2016-03-20 23:17:35	mirv_	why I like C++ is that is gives you a range of options: you could go all-out OO with it, or you could basically just pretend it's C
2016-03-20 23:17:47	Smilex	I also like the idea that dynamic libraries would help keep a system updated and because of that safe and well running. That idea fell flat when put to the test
2016-03-20 23:18:12	Smilex	mirv_: well I'd pretend it's C, so I just need a C compiler
2016-03-20 23:19:11	mirv_	then that's something I can agree with - you just need a C compiler if all you want to write with is C
2016-03-20 23:19:43	mirv_	I just think don't limit yourself to C
2016-03-20 23:20:33	mirv_	also know about where C++ might be good, where assembly might be good, etc
2016-03-20 23:21:44	Smilex	C++ is only good when I'm joining a project that's already in C++
2016-03-20 23:22:35	Smilex	Do you guys use virtualbox for other Linux distros, or is there a better solution for those already on Linux?

2016-03-21 01:25:41	Dragnadh	I wonder what happened to the tw3. I mean at one time it was at this steam linux sale and than I never heard of it again...
2016-03-21 01:25:59	@Samsai	some say tw2 happened
2016-03-21 01:26:03	Dragnadh	Though at first they might wait for vulkan or something but now I dont know...
2016-03-21 01:26:18	Smilex	tw3?
2016-03-21 01:26:37	Dragnadh	the witcher 3
2016-03-21 01:27:04	Smilex	oh yeah! I'm waiting on that

2016-03-21 01:27:30	Dragnadh	t2 had its problems but I mean that Eon wrapper was still early work at that point
2016-03-21 01:27:42	Dragnadh	if you look at that arma 3 vid, it has improved drasticly it seems

2016-03-21 01:30:42	hidekin_	 or they're waiting to work on it when they will finish the witcher 3 expansions
2016-03-21 01:30:55	Smilex	hidekin_: hopefully not
2016-03-21 01:31:09	Smilex	I want it earlier than that
2016-03-21 01:31:25	liothe	they may alsow want their GOG Galaxy client for linux to release together with tw3
2016-03-21 01:31:25	hidekin_	the last expansion should not be too far away
2016-03-21 01:31:39	Smilex	liothe: sounds clever
2016-03-21 01:31:46	hidekin_	could be
2016-03-21 01:31:55	Smilex	hidekin_: last one? I thought they intended to make quite a few
2016-03-21 01:32:10	hidekin_	2 expansions for the witcher 3
2016-03-21 01:32:26	Smilex	I guess I just assumed they would after investing so much into the witcher 3
2016-03-21 01:32:31	Smilex	but I guess their games sell well
2016-03-21 01:32:33	hidekin_	the first one is around 10h and the second one 20h
2016-03-21 01:32:54	Dragnadh	I am not so sure about 2 expansions anymore, since at a conference they released a roadmap which said we would continue to get the witcher 3 dlc into 2017
2016-03-21 01:33:11	Dragnadh	If I remember correctly
2016-03-21 01:33:41	Dragnadh	So it might get more expansions

2016-03-21 01:46:33	baizon	without vdpau it works, with i get out of sync
2016-03-21 01:46:49	Smilex	well then you've already narrowed it down to vdpau
2016-03-21 01:46:52	baizon	Smilex: wathcing livestream, using mpv with hwdec=vdpau
2016-03-21 01:47:11	baizon	but it happens only to livestreams
2016-03-21 01:47:17	baizon	with videos i dont get them

2016-03-21 01:48:04	Smilex	baizon: protocols that livestreams use often send a time signature along with the data. Perhaps there's a bug in vdpau where they calculate that incorrectly
2016-03-21 01:48:47	baizon	hmm, but shouldnt someone report it already?
2016-03-21 01:50:21	Smilex	baizon: I don't know
2016-03-21 01:50:38	Smilex	I'm just guessing with that. What I am implying is that you should try some alternative to vdpau
2016-03-21 01:50:45	Smilex	and then stick with it if it work
2016-03-21 01:50:47	Smilex	s

2016-03-21 05:43:11	linux_gamer	that cant be the easiest way to get the resolution or? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12018535/get-the-width-height-of-the-video-from-h-264-nalu
2016-03-21 05:44:05	linux_gamer	as a right click immediately shows the resolution on ubuntu, that cannot be "calculated"
2016-03-21 05:45:08	gnarface	uh, nope, over my head.... but "ffmpeg -i [video file]" shows the stream resolution too
2016-03-21 05:48:01	linux_gamer	i got a mp4 which is 540p but has the size of the 1080p by its bitrate 7000 (and it should have hd resolution)
2016-03-21 05:48:37	linux_gamer	now im wondering is there is misinformation and the rendering is done by downsampling
2016-03-21 05:48:54	linux_gamer	dk if thats possible with H264
2016-03-21 05:49:21	gnarface	wait that sentence didn't parse for me
2016-03-21 05:49:28	gnarface	"i got a mp4 which is 540p but has the size of the 1080p by its bitrate 7000 (and it should have hd resolution)"
2016-03-21 05:49:54	gnarface	do you mean by this that due to the high bitrate, you'd assume 1080p, or do you mean that you're seeing something incorrectly detect the resolution?
2016-03-21 05:49:54	linux_gamer	like having a svg that is fine to 1000p but is default shown at 100p
2016-03-21 05:50:06	gnarface	hmmm
2016-03-21 05:50:48	linux_gamer	its possible with jpeg too, as some picture show low res before loading fully
2016-03-21 05:51:48	linux_gamer	but im not sure if thats possible with H.264 im no expert
2016-03-21 05:52:02	gnarface	yea i guess i've never seen that either
2016-03-21 05:52:17	gnarface	but i know with h264 you can encode effectively losslessly
2016-03-21 05:52:32	gnarface	its possible to put a lot more bits in there than it really needs
2016-03-21 05:52:37	gnarface	inflating the file size enormously
2016-03-21 05:52:58	linux_gamer	yes, but i hope its a render thing, not date
2016-03-21 05:53:04	linux_gamer	data
2016-03-21 05:53:23	linux_gamer	like the size information went wrong
2016-03-21 05:54:31	linux_gamer	but no idea where to find it, it doesnt seem to be "text" in the bytestream
2016-03-21 05:55:07	gnarface	wait, so ffmpeg -i actually reports this video as 1080p?  or it reports it as 540p?

2016-03-21 06:10:06	stqn	pretty sure the resolution is just what it is…
2016-03-21 06:10:44	@Samsai	linux_gamer, h.264 streams should not contain two streams of different resolution
2016-03-21 06:11:13	@Samsai	at least i've never seen or heard of such behavior
2016-03-21 06:11:55	Smilex	If you guys didn't know. XCB can't do GLX and in turn can't be used to create windows of OGL applications
2016-03-21 06:12:24	Smilex	Another interesting fact is that this is the second time I fall into that pit
2016-03-21 06:12:28	gnarface	i'm still confused if there's an actual discrepancy in the resolution as detected, or if linux_gamer is just confused because someone encoded a 540p h264 stream at an obnoxiously high bitrate (which is totally possible and normal for h264)
2016-03-21 06:13:08	stqn	Smilex: what is xcb?
2016-03-21 06:13:08	@Samsai	gnarface, at least it shouldn't have compression artifacts

2016-03-21 06:46:14	turol	in that case you might want to complain to mesa guys

2016-03-21 06:46:44	JayVii	yeah, i thought it would come to that, eventually
2016-03-21 06:47:50	JayVii	could be another issue entirely as well, though. while all other games i tried run fine, steam itself is _extremely_ crashy as of late and the steam-overlay doesn't work
2016-03-21 06:48:06	JayVii	could also be a distro-specific issue or mesa

2016-03-21 06:54:36	gnarface	Marezz: hey i caught something you said earlier, after you'd left, about Civ5 not having combat animations; I actually had those disabled for multiplayer (the default) because the camera control is really annoying - it forces you to watch every battle.  But, there *are* actually combat animations, and they're pretty cool too.  You should check them out in single player
2016-03-21 06:54:57	Marezz	gnarface, oh, i see
2016-03-21 06:54:59	Marezz	nice
2016-03-21 06:55:05	gnarface	they just get really tedious in co-op
2016-03-21 06:55:13	gnarface	they make the game a lot slower
2016-03-21 06:55:22	Marezz	i understand, matches last pretty long even without them
2016-03-21 06:56:03	gnarface	you can turn off the movement animations too, but i never do because it doesn't really save much time, but makes it harder to visually track where your troops are going
2016-03-21 06:56:36	Marezz	gnarface, whats the time there atm?

2016-03-21 21:00:43	tadzik	which is exactly when I will consider buying it
2016-03-21 21:00:54	AciD`	if on the other hand you care for Linux, use amd open-source driver. 'nuff said

2016-03-21 21:29:57	Dezponia	I agree with anonkun and AciD`. Though its worth mentioning that AMD still requires their binary blob firmware even with the free software drivers. However this is just as bad on every other vendor these days so whichever is the lesser evil and invests the most in free software is probably the best bet
2016-03-21 21:31:34	AciD`	<- using proprietary software in userland, whatever float your boat. Using proprietary software for the OS ; no way.
2016-03-21 21:34:10	AciD`	(disclaimer : the only proprietary software I find much more advanced than there oss counterpart are Excel (as a poweruser, the 2002 version from 14 years ago is STILL better than Libreoffice calc T_T, and the ide from jetbrains, namely phpstorm). Also, games.
2016-03-21 21:34:13	EddDeDuck	good thing you’re not runnig your OS using propritary hardware….
2016-03-21 21:34:15	EddDeDuck	OH wait :p
2016-03-21 21:34:46	AciD`	the stallman way is an hard one to follow!
2016-03-21 21:34:56	AciD`	but a worthy one
2016-03-21 21:35:16	Dezponia	EddDeDuck: Well to be fair, that is one of the big battles right now so its not like people are unaware of the problem of proprietary hardware :)
2016-03-21 21:35:18	EddDeDuck	Sorry cheap shot and I usually agree I like FOSS if it’s a viable option but if something propritary is better then I have no issues with grabbing that insteda
2016-03-21 21:35:37	EddDeDuck	for example I run Nvidia as my first choise

2016-03-21 21:36:57	anonkun	is there a open source spyware that I can compile and put on my friends computer to bypass his anti virus?
2016-03-21 21:37:14	AciD`	windows?
2016-03-21 21:37:17	anonkun	Yeah
2016-03-21 21:37:35	AciD`	no idea
2016-03-21 21:37:37	anonkun	I used to use one of those hackforums obfuscators and spyware packages.
2016-03-21 21:37:39	TomJepp	but the advanced generic detection will block it!
2016-03-21 21:37:42	*	TomJepp giggles
2016-03-21 21:37:50	anonkun	But I cant trust them
2016-03-21 21:37:55	Dezponia	anonkun: Almost certainly, a lot of viruses have had their source code posted online but I'd imagine that all of them are well detected by antivirus vendors by now :)
2016-03-21 21:37:57	AciD`	anonkun -> why would you want to do that?
2016-03-21 21:38:11	anonkun	Just to show how easy it is to bypass antivirus
2016-03-21 21:38:41	AciD`	well, just let them connect to the internets, and that's pretty all
2016-03-21 21:38:44	anonkun	and the first time i did it using the hackforums thing was almost half a decade ago where I was a edgy teenager.
2016-03-21 21:39:07	anonkun	But they believe its not infected unless an anti virus shows it.
2016-03-21 21:39:22	anonkun	so the whole idea was i infect them and then show the keylogs live :)
2016-03-21 21:39:29	anonkun	but I suppose I could find some online
2016-03-21 21:39:35	Dezponia	I think its pretty self evident that antivirus software is not a fool proof protection by now even without doing underhanded stuff :)
2016-03-21 21:39:50	anonkun	not to many :p
2016-03-21 21:40:07	anonkun	https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/4agqi5/bypassing_antivirus_with_ten_lines_of_code/
2016-03-21 21:40:17	anonkun	so like I want to try this
2016-03-21 21:40:34	Dezponia	I recall seeing that chart about what security experts considered the most important practises for staying safe and what ordinary users thought was the most important. Fun chart
2016-03-21 21:40:51	anonkun	I'd like to see that
2016-03-21 21:40:53	anonkun	:D
2016-03-21 21:45:44	TomJepp	anonkun: http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/security-experts-vs-non-experts,news-50834.html ?
2016-03-21 21:45:52	anonkun	thanks
2016-03-21 21:47:15	anonkun	I dont get how a password manager adds to security?

2016-03-21 21:48:08	TomJepp	helps prevent laziness
2016-03-21 21:48:14	EddDeDuck	means you can have massively long and randomised passwords on sites
2016-03-21 21:48:21	TomJepp	"oh, this site is unimportant, I'll just use the password I can remember"
2016-03-21 21:48:30	anonkun	Those are password generators, not managers
2016-03-21 21:48:37	anonkun	or password generators within password managers
2016-03-21 21:48:50	anonkun	But I like the tomjepp thing
2016-03-21 21:48:52	EddDeDuck	for example if someone cracks the password on one site you’re safe for all the otehrs
2016-03-21 21:48:54	TomJepp	a password manager makes good unique passwords usable without having to remember each one
2016-03-21 21:48:55	anonkun	Using unique passwords made on it
2016-03-21 21:49:15	anonkun	It really makes sense now :)

2016-03-21 21:50:06	TomJepp	all the sane ones do all their crypto on the client. I sync mine via my own owncloud server
2016-03-21 21:50:17	EddDeDuck	You should use a system that encrypts your data client side
2016-03-21 21:50:25	anonkun	What do you guys recommend?
2016-03-21 21:50:39	anonkun	I have like over 20 unique sites I visit
2016-03-21 21:50:45	anonkun	I only have like 4 passwords.
2016-03-21 21:50:53	EddDeDuck	I sync mine via dropbox but given it’s encrypted even if somene hacked dropbox and graend the file they would have a job unlocking
2016-03-21 21:51:06	anonkun	But which manager do you use?

2016-03-21 21:51:49	TomJepp	I use a proprietary one that doesn't provide linux binaries :( but they publish the spec for the file format, so I wrote an app for it for linux use
2016-03-21 21:52:07	anonkun	oo
2016-03-21 21:52:11	TomJepp	KeePass is probably the most popular free one (but I haven't used it in years, when I did it was kinda a usability nightmare
2016-03-21 21:52:16	EddDeDuck	I uses a propritary one that doesn’t have a Linux client (yet)
2016-03-21 21:52:24	EddDeDuck	1password
2016-03-21 21:52:29	TomJepp	EddDeDuck: ditto!
2016-03-21 21:52:35	EddDeDuck	It’s fantastic
2016-03-21 21:52:35	anonkun	I have kdewallet
2016-03-21 21:52:44	anonkun	let me check if it can do online passwords for websites
2016-03-21 21:53:01	TomJepp	anonkun: it can store with konqueror at least
2016-03-21 21:53:42	anonkun	I remember using keepassx
2016-03-21 21:53:49	anonkun	I used a key combo to type in the ID and password
2016-03-21 21:54:06	anonkun	it accidentally typed in the password in the login field becuase I clicked the title bar
2016-03-21 21:54:06	anonkun	xD
2016-03-21 21:54:37	TomJepp	1password on osx and windows provides browser plugins which make that a bit easier - it can fill form fields for you rather than auto-typing
2016-03-21 21:54:55	TomJepp	and it does an integrity check of the browser before it will do it, too
2016-03-21 21:56:05	TomJepp	but if you live all day every day on linux it's kinda suboptimal.
2016-03-21 21:56:39	anonkun	there's a kwallet addon for firefox
2016-03-21 21:56:42	anonkun	i'm checking that out
2016-03-21 21:57:53	anonkun	would you recommend the firefox password manager?
2016-03-21 21:58:17	TomJepp	I don't know enough about it.

2016-03-21 22:03:28	anonkun	I am a bit skeptical about storing passwords at all :P
2016-03-21 22:03:46	anonkun	That's why i'm asking you guys about how you secure your stuff, so maybe I could store it in a efficient manner.
2016-03-21 22:04:04	TomJepp	to be fair, that involves getting malware onto the machine. once you've got some random third party code running, you're always *screwed*

2016-03-22 04:46:24	@Samsai	they seem to want to keep the price low and have a bunch of free weekends to get new people in as fast as possible

2016-03-22 04:48:59	@Samsai	as in, no download yet
2016-03-22 04:49:34	@NaughtySquid	mine is almost finished downloading
2016-03-22 04:50:12	@Samsai	you need to send me some of that bandwidth in mail someday
2016-03-22 04:50:27	@NaughtySquid	was thinking about upgrading again
2016-03-22 04:51:01	Ysblokje	dont underestimate the bandwidth of a truck full of dvd's ;)
2016-03-22 04:51:05	@Samsai	how do you use that bandwidth?
2016-03-22 04:51:14	@Samsai	you have enough, stop
2016-03-22 04:51:19	Ysblokje	never
2016-03-22 04:51:21	Ysblokje	enough
2016-03-22 04:51:26	Ysblokje	p....
2016-03-22 04:51:48	UberLambda	anyone hyped for Mirror's Edge Catalyst?
2016-03-22 04:51:50	@NaughtySquid	looks like i will be livestreaming tonight then
2016-03-22 04:51:52	UberLambda	too bad it's windows only
2016-03-22 04:52:05	anonkun	EA
2016-03-22 04:52:10	@Samsai	UberLambda, windows only, so no i am not
2016-03-22 04:52:19	anonkun	I kinda despise AAA games after my star wars battlefront and GTAV online experiences.
2016-03-22 04:52:22	@NaughtySquid	missing executable lmao
2016-03-22 04:52:33	qptain_Nemo	windows only + EA? yeah no.
2016-03-22 04:52:39	UberLambda	I know... but the first ME is one of my favourite games (and it's still EA)
2016-03-22 04:52:50	@Samsai	never played it
2016-03-22 04:52:54	qptain_Nemo	i get it though. would watch someone play
2016-03-22 04:52:58	anonkun	My entire steam library on linux which is 20+ games ATM costs less than GTAV + Battlefront :/
2016-03-22 04:53:04	Ysblokje	played it
2016-03-22 04:53:04	Smilex	is payday2 25GB?
2016-03-22 04:53:07	Ysblokje	it was nice
2016-03-22 04:53:15	@Samsai	Smilex, it's huge, that much i remember
2016-03-22 04:53:22	@Samsai	i had to download it overnight
2016-03-22 04:53:28	Smilex	Ok I'm skipping it then
2016-03-22 04:53:32	UberLambda	I mean... I'm the first one to prefer games that run on linux, but I'd be willing to make an exception this time :P
2016-03-22 04:53:38	@Samsai	didn't you upgrade your internet recently?
2016-03-22 04:53:54	Smilex	it says 25GB on Steam download prompt, but I didn't want to believe it
2016-03-22 04:54:05	UberLambda	25GB for payday??
2016-03-22 04:54:14	@Samsai	UberLambda, these days i pretty much go with the "no tux no bucks, don't buy before it's out" mantra
2016-03-22 04:54:22	Smilex	Samsai: Sure, but I know people are very unhappy about payday 2
2016-03-22 04:54:24	@Samsai	helps with life in general
2016-03-22 04:54:34	Smilex	only wanted it because it's free and I could maybe play a little
2016-03-22 04:54:58	UberLambda	Samsai: I do still have a windows license though, as much as I hate it, because I think some games are worth the hassle
2016-03-22 04:55:07	UberLambda	my Windows install is basically a steam launcher
2016-03-22 04:55:20	@Samsai	UberLambda, all my devices run something other than windows
2016-03-22 04:55:32	@Samsai	actually, i am lying
2016-03-22 04:55:42	@Samsai	i have an RT tablet i will be taking apart soon-ish
2016-03-22 04:55:42	Smilex	Samsai: that's one way to avoid mentioning apple
2016-03-22 04:55:53	@Samsai	the next closest thing is my old laptop running freedos
2016-03-22 04:57:16	qptain_Nemo	i also have an old laptop with freedos
2016-03-22 04:57:40	UberLambda	on a side note, anyone here with an AMD card?
2016-03-22 04:57:49	@Samsai	i run an r7 370
2016-03-22 04:58:06	UberLambda	I have a 560Ti that I plan to swap somewhen this year
2016-03-22 04:58:39	@Samsai	so your question is if AMD is a good next step
2016-03-22 04:58:41	UberLambda	but I can't decide between NVidia and AMD... on one hand AMD is said to make crappy OpenGL drivers, on the other there's the upcoming amdgpu module
2016-03-22 04:58:47	anonkun	it says 25GB o.O
2016-03-22 04:59:09	@Samsai	i wouldn't expect a miracle in terms of performance
2016-03-22 04:59:18	UberLambda	from AMD you mean?
2016-03-22 04:59:25	@Samsai	if you care about open source enough then the choice is obvious
2016-03-22 04:59:38	@Samsai	but if you are a gamer first and need games to run optimally, go for nvidia
2016-03-22 04:59:38	UberLambda	I don't really care about using binary blobs in my system
2016-03-22 05:00:07	UberLambda	oh, ok then!
2016-03-22 05:01:32	@Samsai	basically the amdgpu module thing will only solve the other big gripe with the AMD drivers which is their compatibility
2016-03-22 05:02:19	redje	payday2 released for tux :o
2016-03-22 05:02:20	@Samsai	but the opengl component hasn't really changed a whole lot

2016-03-22 05:02:41	calexil	im fucked so far
2016-03-22 05:03:07	calexil	fglrx is buggy af despite having the best performance
2016-03-22 05:03:18	calexil	but is incompatible with newer kernels
2016-03-22 05:03:41	calexil	radeonSI is decent but fails miserably at the games actually play
2016-03-22 05:04:01	calexil	also has no gui to manage any of the cards features, or vsync, AA, etc
2016-03-22 05:04:24	calexil	amdgpu is only going back to GCN 1.1 so far so basically I'm fucked
2016-03-22 05:04:38	calexil	as are 370 users
2016-03-22 05:04:45	UberLambda	well... there's also vulkan now
2016-03-22 05:04:49	calexil	since its the same card
2016-03-22 05:04:56	UberLambda	assuming that games will start to use it, what about that?
2016-03-22 05:05:05	calexil	the vulkan driver does not support gcn 1.0 cards
2016-03-22 05:05:15	calexil	1.1 forward only so far
2016-03-22 05:05:18	UberLambda	well, I'd have to buy a new one anyways
2016-03-22 05:05:25	calexil	if youre getting one
2016-03-22 05:05:26	UberLambda	sorry for you though
2016-03-22 05:05:28	calexil	get a 380
2016-03-22 05:05:30	UberLambda	*I'm
2016-03-22 05:05:40	UberLambda	380?
2016-03-22 05:05:41	calexil	the 380 is just right for the price
2016-03-22 05:05:43	calexil	and support
2016-03-22 05:05:43	stqn	oh, Payday 2 free for one week… nice
2016-03-22 05:05:51	calexil	its a GCN 1.2 card
2016-03-22 05:05:54	Ysblokje	I've seen a config application for glx related stuff at some point
2016-03-22 05:05:58	calexil	but wont break the bank
2016-03-22 05:05:59	Ysblokje	isnt it there anymore?
2016-03-22 05:06:10	calexil	yeah that has to be compiled
2016-03-22 05:06:12	calexil	and it blows
2016-03-22 05:06:32	calexil	radeon feature
2016-03-22 05:06:34	UberLambda	calexil: seems a nice card for ~200ish €

2016-03-22 05:07:07	calexil	ill sell my r9 270 and get a r9 380x
2016-03-22 05:07:20	ky0	wooo payday2!
2016-03-22 05:07:21	calexil	because mah opensource

2016-03-22 05:07:31	UberLambda	NVidia already fucked me xD
2016-03-22 05:07:47	UberLambda	"yeah we'll support the GTX 5xx series with our vulkan driver... sure"
2016-03-22 05:08:02	calexil	ohh thats an old af card though
2016-03-22 05:08:17	calexil	cant complain too much
2016-03-22 05:08:19	UberLambda	I know, but it still runs pretty nicely
2016-03-22 05:08:25	calexil	planned obsolescence is a real thing
2016-03-22 05:08:34	UberLambda	yeah :/
2016-03-22 05:08:41	anonkun	Its sad
2016-03-22 05:08:46	calexil	and you have to accept that you will need to upgrade cards like...at least every 5 years
2016-03-22 05:08:46	UberLambda	but atleast they couldn't have promised to support 5xx and 4xx series
2016-03-22 05:08:53	anonkun	Because after I got several updates for my old nvidia GPU
2016-03-22 05:08:57	anonkun	bad company 2 was no longer playable
2016-03-22 05:08:59	anonkun	:/
2016-03-22 05:09:11	anonkun	I needed to revert to an older version of the driver on windows.
2016-03-22 05:09:12	UberLambda	well that's quite bad
2016-03-22 05:09:16	DerRidda	Did they ever actually say they were going to support these cards?

2016-03-22 05:10:37	UberLambda	I have to find the article that said they'd be supported
2016-03-22 05:10:42	DerRidda	That's the announcement that they do not support these cards.
2016-03-22 05:11:10	DerRidda	Where did they say they would?
2016-03-22 05:11:43	DerRidda	The articles claims they did but doesn't provide sources either.

2016-03-22 05:18:08	tadzik	at least it's free for a while
2016-03-22 05:18:18	tadzik	and quite a while it is!
2016-03-22 05:18:23	tadzik	that's nice, after all that shitty PR they got
2016-03-22 05:18:25	anonkun	you think I can finish the game in that much time/
2016-03-22 05:18:59	UberLambda	If anything that I've heard about their microtransactions is true I won't even install it
2016-03-22 05:19:21	UberLambda	the only valid form of microtransactions is to buy TF2 hats ;)

2016-03-22 05:22:32	anonkun	Also, Rockstar Games is actually owned by 2K Software, a publisher which already showed a lot of interest in the Linux platform. Games like Civilization V, Civilization: Beyond Earth, or Borderlands, already have Linux versions.
2016-03-22 05:22:34	anonkun	wat :O
2016-03-22 05:22:42	Marezz	i cant try payday 2 with my intel hd :(
2016-03-22 05:22:51	UberLambda	wait... Rockstar <-> 2K???
2016-03-22 05:23:39	UberLambda	seems like gearbox is owned by the same company that owns rockstar

2016-03-22 05:27:10	anonkun	such a wide range of games o.O
2016-03-22 05:27:11	UberLambda	so they basically have every AAA studio that isn't ea, ubisoft or valve

2016-03-22 05:29:08	UberLambda	but... valve doesn't make games
2016-03-22 05:29:11	UberLambda	they make money now
2016-03-22 05:29:16	ky0	payday2 runs really well
2016-03-22 05:29:34	UberLambda	on a side note... I'm hyped for source 2 :P
2016-03-22 05:29:40	anonkun	No, they are doing fine
2016-03-22 05:29:48	anonkun	Do you really want a new half life every year :/ ?
2016-03-22 05:30:01	UberLambda	I just want one more
2016-03-22 05:30:01	anonkun	followed by a new dota every year
2016-03-22 05:30:07	UberLambda	just. one.
2016-03-22 05:30:07	anonkun	and a new CS every year
2016-03-22 05:30:13	anonkun	Sorry
2016-03-22 05:30:17	anonkun	but half life is never going to happen
2016-03-22 05:30:24	anonkun	because they are too scared to fail.
2016-03-22 05:30:30	UberLambda	Ik... atleast make a Portal 3 then
2016-03-22 05:30:33	anonkun	and they can already make money with hats
2016-03-22 05:31:03	anonkun	I assume once VR becomes a bit more mature and mainstrean they could maybe consider HL3.
2016-03-22 05:31:05	mirv_	I'm sorry, I can't help it, I have to poke the beast with a stick
2016-03-22 05:31:08	anonkun	mainstream*
2016-03-22 05:31:18	mirv_	so nvidia users can now do what I've been able to do for a couple of years now
2016-03-22 05:31:23	mirv_	...yay, I guess?
2016-03-22 05:31:28	UberLambda	that is?
2016-03-22 05:31:29	anonkun	what is that o.O?
2016-03-22 05:31:39	mirv_	wayland
2016-03-22 05:31:42	UberLambda	oh
2016-03-22 05:31:47	mirv_	have kms
2016-03-22 05:31:53	anonkun	wait wat
2016-03-22 05:31:59	UberLambda	I don't think wayland will end up well though
2016-03-22 05:32:05	UberLambda	I mean... virtually no one uses it
2016-03-22 05:32:12	mirv_	except I can still have all that immediately with each kernel release
2016-03-22 05:32:32	anonkun	So you use wayland?
2016-03-22 05:32:36	mirv_	I test it out occasionally, it needs some better toolkit support

2016-03-22 05:32:50	mirv_	but kms alone, without wayland, is worth it
2016-03-22 05:32:52	anonkun	Because I always find the windows compositor buggy too.
2016-03-22 05:33:07	anonkun	not as buggy as X ofc.
2016-03-22 05:33:09	UberLambda	-offtopic- anyone here who is also a developer?
2016-03-22 05:33:31	mirv_	developer of what, exactly?
2016-03-22 05:33:49	UberLambda	anything soft real-time
2016-03-22 05:33:54	UberLambda	such as a video game :P
2016-03-22 05:33:59	anonkun	I dont really know what KMS is, apart from that its worked on by microsoft.
2016-03-22 05:34:15	mirv_	anonkun, kernel mode setting
2016-03-22 05:34:30	anonkun	What does it do?
2016-03-22 05:34:31	tadzik	UberLambda: quite a few of us, yes :)
2016-03-22 05:34:44	@Samsai	what classifies as a developer?
2016-03-22 05:34:53	@Samsai	i have written a project or two
2016-03-22 05:34:58	anonkun	Yeah I think some feral devs hangout here too.
2016-03-22 05:35:09	UberLambda	so... would any of you think that something like Elm is ready for games?
2016-03-22 05:35:21	mirv_	anonkun, this can probably explain it better than I can: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_mode_setting
2016-03-22 05:35:32	anonkun	funny
2016-03-22 05:35:36	Ysblokje	developer ? jip. present
2016-03-22 05:35:37	anonkun	how I was just reading the arch wiki :P
2016-03-22 05:35:51	mirv_	elm...elm...isn't that part of the EFL?
2016-03-22 05:36:04	UberLambda	I mean for "serious" games that need C++-like performance
2016-03-22 05:36:14	UberLambda	http://elm-lang.org/
2016-03-22 05:36:20	anonkun	mirv_: but kms can only be used with the free driver right
2016-03-22 05:36:37	UberLambda	^ I'm sick of writing C++ and I'm considering porting Elm (or writing a language very similiar to it) to the desktop
2016-03-22 05:36:49	mirv_	anonkun, sort of, nvidia had their own version, but it wasn't what I'd call "true" kms
2016-03-22 05:36:52	Ysblokje	UberLambda, be carefull about c++ performance, you might wake Smilex ;)
2016-03-22 05:36:56	UberLambda	it's just that I'd probabily have to really learn Haskell, too, to write a compiler for it
2016-03-22 05:37:06	mirv_	anonkun, seems the latest nvidia blob hooks in a kernel module to support kms
2016-03-22 05:37:07	UberLambda	Y sblokje: ?
2016-03-22 05:37:29	anonkun	mirv_: but doesnt the free driver have lower performance than the nonfree one?
2016-03-22 05:38:00	mirv_	well, the nvidia blob probably only hooks in after initial startup, so in-kernel can still have a nicer framebuffer for the console
2016-03-22 05:38:03	Ysblokje	UberLambda, just ask him about it ;)
2016-03-22 05:38:15	mirv_	anonkun, lower, yes, but not that much (depends on the game)
2016-03-22 05:38:38	mirv_	in some cases, particularly with amd, the FOSS drivers outperform the blobs
2016-03-22 05:38:43	*	UberLambda launches Smilex --hi
2016-03-22 05:38:51	anonkun	I thought devs had a hard time reverse engineering the nvidia cards.
2016-03-22 05:38:56	mirv_	with nvidia, the FOSS drivers aren't anywhere close to the blobs
2016-03-22 05:39:13	mirv_	yep, nvidia is about as anti-FOSS as a company can get
2016-03-22 05:39:24	anonkun	so wait, the nvidia proprietary driver runs on userland? o.O
2016-03-22 05:39:30	UberLambda	yeah
2016-03-22 05:39:40	anonkun	ouch
2016-03-22 05:39:48	UberLambda	but I know for sure that it also has an "nvidia" module
2016-03-22 05:39:49	mirv_	they have kernel modules
2016-03-22 05:40:05	qptain_Nemo	mirv_: i disagree with that statement
2016-03-22 05:40:16	qptain_Nemo	it's so anti-FOSS it provides the best graphics experience on the most FOSS-centric operating system?
2016-03-22 05:40:32	frostwork	maybe I haven't looked close enough, but does anybody know who did the payday2 port?
2016-03-22 05:40:34	mirv_	qptain_Nemo, it provides that for workstations, not gamers
2016-03-22 05:40:39	anonkun	^
2016-03-22 05:40:52	qptain_Nemo	mirv_: i dunno from what i hear and my own experience, it does
2016-03-22 05:40:54	anonkun	It's so "pro-foss" and it provides the best "non-foss" graphics.
2016-03-22 05:40:59	anonkun	that*
2016-03-22 05:41:05	mirv_	gamers sure benefit, but workstations are the main market
2016-03-22 05:41:06	Smilex	"No semicolons. No mandatory parentheses for function calls." <- these guys truly are pushing technology
2016-03-22 05:41:08	qptain_Nemo	i'm not saying it's pro-foss
2016-03-22 05:41:28	anonkun	I think they've been very reluctant to develop their driver on linux
2016-03-22 05:41:40	anonkun	even if its better than the competition
2016-03-22 05:41:56	mirv_	nvidia rewrite whole swathes of things to suit them better, and close it all up
2016-03-22 05:42:01	qptain_Nemo	what does reluctance matter in the face of actual results?
2016-03-22 05:42:16	anonkun	I'm pretty sure there is no optimus support either
2016-03-22 05:42:21	anonkun	correct me if im wrong
2016-03-22 05:42:23	frostwork	frostwork, probably a starbreeze in-house port
2016-03-22 05:42:27	Smilex	UberLambda: looks like elm-lang is already basically Haskell, so just use Haskell
2016-03-22 05:42:30	frostwork	frostwork, ah thx
2016-03-22 05:42:47	anonkun	qptain_Nemo: I dont know if the nvidia driver on my linux performs better than my nvidia driver on windows
2016-03-22 05:42:58	anonkun	former windows*
2016-03-22 05:43:02	mirv_	nvidia wall off just about everything they write, you can't get access
2016-03-22 05:43:03	anonkun	RIP
2016-03-22 05:43:09	UberLambda	Smilex: yeah, but there's signals and ports as first class citizens
2016-03-22 05:43:12	mirv_	it pollutes the kernel (and there's still debate whether that's legal or not)
2016-03-22 05:43:21	UberLambda	Smilex: also, no lazy evaluation
2016-03-22 05:44:14	mirv_	nvidia only grudingly allow foss drivers to get firmware loaded onto the cards
2016-03-22 05:44:33	Smilex	UberLambda: Gibberish. If you want to your head to be entirely in a math mode, then use a functional language. If you want to be serious, then use C
2016-03-22 05:44:46	Smilex	Has anyone here used EFI boot?
2016-03-22 05:44:59	UberLambda	Smilex: I don't get why I couldn't do both
2016-03-22 05:45:19	UberLambda	Smilex: e.g. elm (or something like that) for the frontend and a C++ engine on the back
2016-03-22 05:45:32	Smilex	UberLambda: Because no one has solved the problem yet
2016-03-22 05:45:40	UberLambda	what problem?
2016-03-22 05:45:52	Smilex	and C isn't just about speed or nostalgia
2016-03-22 05:46:18	UberLambda	well... as for compatibility, almost every language that I know has C bindings
2016-03-22 05:48:06	Smilex	UberLambda: a program is just a sequence of instructions acting on data. Anything else is just marketing buzz and clueless academics
2016-03-22 05:48:24	Smilex	make me a functional language that thinks like that, and I'll give it a shot
2016-03-22 05:48:44	UberLambda	Smilex: yeah, but what about multithreading?
2016-03-22 05:49:17	UberLambda	Smilex: it seems very hard to me to make anything multithreaded useful in C

2016-03-22 05:49:37	UberLambda	Smilex: I mean... without sprinkling mutexes everywhere I mean
2016-03-22 05:49:39	@NaughtySquid	well it has cross-platform mp
2016-03-22 05:49:53	Smilex	UberLambda: I don't know what you are asking. pthreads exposes a API for it that's quite good
2016-03-22 05:50:21	UberLambda	Smilex: I mean that functional languages seem to be better suited to it in general due to purity
2016-03-22 05:50:59	UberLambda	Smilex: I'm quite sure that you could write something like that in any language... but doing it in C seems a pain
2016-03-22 05:51:26	Smilex	UberLambda: make a type modification that includes a mutex for the variable with each declaration, and then make the basic operations act on such types with mutexes in mind

2016-03-22 05:53:02	Smilex	UberLambda: Then spend time researching and solving the problem of multithreading without mutexes. That is not relevant to any programming language
2016-03-22 05:53:42	UberLambda	people seem already to have found something
2016-03-22 05:53:54	UberLambda	I mean... software transactional memory for instance
2016-03-22 05:54:11	UberLambda	I've never seen STM implemented in C (and I don't know if it's possible)
2016-03-22 05:54:28	Smilex	I wouldn't know
2016-03-22 05:54:47	Smilex	C is lackluster

2016-03-22 06:25:20	@NaughtySquid	any idea what?
2016-03-22 06:25:39	gnarface	NaughtySquid: a quick string search of the source shows "http:" showing up half a dozen times at least
2016-03-22 06:25:57	gnarface	NaughtySquid: maybe some javascript stuff? i'm not sure the itemtype= attributes or that meta tag count
2016-03-22 06:27:02	gnarface	NaughtySquid: er, maybe not. those are on the other articles too, but i'm only getting the error for this one
2016-03-22 06:27:09	@NaughtySquid	unsure what then
2016-03-22 06:27:14	@NaughtySquid	as all images and such are https
2016-03-22 06:27:29	@NaughtySquid	the only thing http are links to outside sites and html schema stuff
2016-03-22 06:27:47	gnarface	in theory it would have to be an image, a javascript file, or a css file
2016-03-22 06:27:57	gnarface	image or embed
2016-03-22 06:27:57	@NaughtySquid	all of which are https as far as i can see

2016-03-22 06:31:10	gnarface	my first suspect would be those stupid twitter/facebook sharing links, but they're on every page too

2016-03-22 06:34:03	gnarface	i'm wondering if this one is failing and falling back to http

2016-03-22 06:48:37	gnarface	NaughtySquid: if whatever it is isn't showing up in your server logs, then its likely to be something loading from an external domain, and if you don't know what it is off the top of your head, chances of it being rogue javascript someone slipped into some field are pretty high
2016-03-22 06:48:56	Marezz	well payday 2 is absolute slide show for me :(

2016-03-22 06:49:19	gnarface	magamo: its not showing up in there, but i'm not 100% sure you can't hide it by having said rogue javascript remove it after its loaded
2016-03-22 06:49:44	gnarface	magamo: at that point the damage would already be done, data logged to the 3rd party's server

2016-03-22 09:18:35	Smilex	Does anyone know of any interesting game that would be worth looking into for someone who really likes Factioro? Has to be multiplayer
2016-03-22 09:19:07	gnarface	its a stretch, but Starbound?
2016-03-22 09:19:25	Smilex	gnarface: I've tried getting my friends to try that. They are reluctant
2016-03-22 09:19:45	gnarface	Smilex: i'd say FTL but its single-player
2016-03-22 09:19:55	Smilex	like Factorio?
2016-03-22 09:19:56	gnarface	i still think FTL needs a multi-player mode
2016-03-22 09:20:12	gnarface	eh, i wouldn't say like factorio, i'm not sure there's anything at all like it
2016-03-22 09:20:30	gnarface	but i feel like maybe they have a similar type of attraction
2016-03-22 09:20:33	openfbtd	Does ARK still have real shit performance?
2016-03-22 09:20:38	Smilex	hm. I used to play 2D top down space economy games with big ambitions but poor execution. Maybe someone knows about one that also had good execution?
2016-03-22 09:21:07	gnarface	like M.O.O ?
2016-03-22 09:21:20	Smilex	gnarface: there is clockwork empires. But it's singleplayer and a tad expensive to just try
2016-03-22 09:21:20	gnarface	or what was that one
2016-03-22 09:21:23	gnarface	M.U.L.E.
2016-03-22 09:21:57	Smilex	gnarface: is that a very old game?

2016-03-22 09:36:57	openfbtd	I'm looking at ARK and want to play it. But apparently on my GTX680 it is unplayable
2016-03-22 09:37:20	stqn	I played it on my GTX 660 so I doubt it’s unplayable on a 680
2016-03-22 09:37:41	stqn	but of course and as always, the CPU matters (and the RAM, and the video settings)
2016-03-22 09:38:10	openfbtd	Hmm. Reports from summer 2015 say really bad things.
2016-03-22 09:38:12	openfbtd	>same here I have a gtx 980, 16 gb ram but only 10-20 (looking into the island), 25-35 (looking at the sea) fps.
2016-03-22 09:38:27	openfbtd	But yeah, summer 2015 was long ago
2016-03-22 09:38:30	gnarface	16GB?!
2016-03-22 09:38:35	gnarface	they have ones with 16GB?
2016-03-22 09:38:45	gnarface	oh wait there's a ,
2016-03-22 09:38:47	gnarface	nevermind
2016-03-22 09:38:49	stqn	sometimes people insist on playing with all the settings to high and complain about low framerates…
2016-03-22 09:38:52	openfbtd	No, I'm pretty sure he has 16G RAM in the machine :)
2016-03-22 09:38:55	stqn	or maybe they have a slow cpu
2016-03-22 09:39:46	Smilex	ARK also was laughed at on youtube videos when it first got popular
2016-03-22 09:39:53	Smilex	lots nonsense and bugs
2016-03-22 09:40:18	openfbtd	Oh nvm ARK pretty much requires coop
2016-03-22 09:40:37	Smilex	openfbtd: it's an MMO right?
2016-03-22 09:40:42	openfbtd	Fuck it then
2016-03-22 09:41:47	Smilex	Anyone here know the name of a FPS survival space game that actually got good reviews?
2016-03-22 09:41:59	EddDeDuck	Alien Isolation? ;)
2016-03-22 09:42:07	stqn	eheh
2016-03-22 09:42:09	gnarface	the original DOOM
2016-03-22 09:42:12	EddDeDuck	*cough* not biased
2016-03-22 09:42:19	Smilex	EddDeDuck: I still want to play that, but no this is for multiplayer sessions
2016-03-22 09:42:24	Smilex	and persistent worlds
2016-03-22 09:42:54	stqn	I’m not sure such a thing exists (for Linux)
2016-03-22 09:43:20	Smilex	guys! Google listens in on IRC. I searched for "FPS survival space" and the 6th result is "Improve your FPS in ARK"

2016-03-24 01:01:46	NoirLess	what is hair fx?
2016-03-24 01:02:26	fs0ciety	it is the AMD hair fx that was on the original release
2016-03-24 01:02:32	fs0ciety	hair tesselation, similar to gameworks
2016-03-24 01:02:44	fs0ciety	amusing really considering how AMD cracked the shits over it in Witcher 3, and they did it years before.
2016-03-24 01:03:07	@NaughtySquid	the issue in TW3 was it used nvidia tools
2016-03-24 01:03:18	fs0ciety	and in tomb raider they used amd tools
2016-03-24 01:03:29	@NaughtySquid	which worked fine on nvidia
2016-03-24 01:03:40	fs0ciety	hahaha riight, even on a 970 it still runs like crap with it turned on
2016-03-24 01:03:49	hidekin_	I think the second tombraider use gameworks

2016-03-24 01:38:16	EddDeDuck	I don’t as much but sometimes dem deals!
2016-03-24 01:38:27	Ysblokje	^ that
2016-03-24 01:38:32	stqn	I do buy bundles from time to time though
2016-03-24 01:38:51	stqn	bah the sales are usually the same as on Steam
2016-03-24 01:39:06	Ysblokje	but linux has _was_ a first class citizen in the beginning
2016-03-24 01:39:26	NoirLess	steam also has drm
2016-03-24 01:39:33	EddDeDuck	If someone does buy that latets sega bundle I’ll take the 66% off Football Manager off your hands :)
2016-03-24 01:39:45	EddDeDuck	NoirLess that’s not exactly true
2016-03-24 01:39:54	EddDeDuck	Steam doesn’t have to have DRM
2016-03-24 01:39:55	stqn	NoirLess: not always
2016-03-24 01:40:02	EddDeDuck	However it has an ecosystem of achivements etc
2016-03-24 01:40:27	EddDeDuck	If you want the goodness of achoiveemnts, friends multiplayer then you’re using a third party system
2016-03-24 01:40:32	EddDeDuck	GoG is similar
2016-03-24 01:40:37	NoirLess	achievements are only things, to force you play more
2016-03-24 01:40:42	NoirLess	Im trapped in it

2016-03-24 01:41:04	EddDeDuck	When it boils down to it anyting with friends and other features is a cleverly design guilded cage which works way better than DRM does
2016-03-24 01:41:16	NoirLess	one day you will find youself, leaves games turned on to farm hours
2016-03-24 01:41:19	NoirLess	:/
2016-03-24 01:41:21	stqn	I very rarely care about achievements… I just look at them to see what the other players did compared to me, sometimes
2016-03-24 01:41:33	EddDeDuck	Pirates can’t play with friends, online etc so they just buy the game
2016-03-24 01:41:50	NoirLess	you can play drm-free games online too
2016-03-24 01:41:55	NoirLess	ever outside of steam
2016-03-24 01:41:56	EddDeDuck	Cloud Save game sync is another big one that helps stop piracy
2016-03-24 01:42:00	psymin	EddDeDuck: by that logic I should have pirated Dying Light :D

2016-03-24 01:43:01	xpander69	automatic updates!
2016-03-24 01:43:06	stqn	I prefer the logic that we want more games like dying light on linux ;)
2016-03-24 01:43:19	*	psymin nods.
2016-03-24 01:43:23	NoirLess	xpander69, gog galaxy has automatic updates too
2016-03-24 01:43:31	xpander69	not for linox
2016-03-24 01:43:31	NoirLess	also they are optional
2016-03-24 01:43:32	NoirLess	yet
2016-03-24 01:43:40	NoirLess	they r workin on it
2016-03-24 01:43:43	xpander69	so screw them until they do
2016-03-24 01:43:47	Ysblokje	NoirLess, where is galaxy?
2016-03-24 01:43:55	NoirLess	Ysblokje, in this galaxy
2016-03-24 01:44:00	stqn	automatic updates are nice, when the new version is better than the old one… :-/
2016-03-24 01:44:10	Ysblokje	I think its in a parallel universe
2016-03-24 01:44:15	NoirLess	stqn, yep. GoG's ones are optional
2016-03-24 01:44:21	stqn	NoirLess: nice.
2016-03-24 01:44:46	stqn	even better: being able to choose the version (with git? :p)
2016-03-24 01:44:52	EddDeDuck	You can disable / ignore updates on Steam with a little effort
2016-03-24 01:45:12	xpander69	and some early access devs create multiple branches for people who want to play older versions
2016-03-24 01:45:16	stqn	EddDeDuck: it’s not in the options GUI, is it?
2016-03-24 01:45:22	xpander69	ETS2/ATS have this i think
2016-03-24 01:45:30	xpander69	so not only early access :D
2016-03-24 01:45:51	NoirLess	EddDeDuck, you can ignore - if you wanna play game, that has updates, you will MUST download updates
2016-03-24 01:45:53	EddDeDuck	yep it is just wierdly worded
2016-03-24 01:45:56	NoirLess	*cant
2016-03-24 01:46:14	EddDeDuck	We’ve had to do this during dev (ignoire updates)
2016-03-24 01:46:51	stqn	the default is annoying as when you want to play and there is an update to download, Steam prevents you from playing
2016-03-24 01:47:26	stqn	when the update is small it’s ok…
2016-03-24 01:47:33	EddDeDuck	“Only update this game when I launch it” when you do this it pops up asking you if you want to update and you say no do it later (or soemthing)
2016-03-24 01:47:45	EddDeDuck	It used to be a lot easier / nicer
2016-03-24 01:48:02	EddDeDuck	There was an don’t update unless manually troiggered type option
2016-03-24 01:48:12	stqn	ah, ok
2016-03-24 01:50:19	NoirLess	EddDeDuck, dunno. last time, when im pressed "no" - window closed and game didnt launch, until you will update it
2016-03-24 01:50:46	EddDeDuck	mmm it could have changed IO have’d done it for anout a month...
2016-03-24 01:50:58	EddDeDuck	I agree it’s a pain though
2016-03-24 01:51:42	stqn	Talking of updates… YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS Dying Light has a chromatic aberration toggle!!!!
2016-03-24 01:51:57	stqn	And it even works.
2016-03-24 01:52:23	psymin	no linux multiplayer though :(
2016-03-24 01:52:39	stqn	Ah I don’t care about that, but it sucks…
2016-03-24 01:54:41	linux_gamer	chromatics was no doubt hard to deactivate
2016-03-24 01:55:09	linux_gamer	hard to disable a function/shader or wtf

2016-03-24 02:26:50	psymin	I see the game time in reviews
2016-03-24 02:27:00	psymin	maybe it is from enhanced steam though?
2016-03-24 02:28:18	stqn	ok, they are back… must have been a db connection issue
2016-03-24 02:28:41	stqn	oh no, I know… I was looking at the reviews for a DLC
2016-03-24 02:37:42	stqn	confusing that Dying light and its DLC now don’t have the "steamos" icon. But everybody says it’s working on linux anyway.

2016-03-24 03:24:05	raedah	clinfo works
2016-03-24 03:24:31	raedah	Samsai, the prebuilt packages for Arch only come in two flavors. The new ones, and these ones.
2016-03-24 03:25:08	@Samsai	raedah, i recommend downloading from AMD's website then
2016-03-24 03:25:31	raedah	can you link me plz?

2016-03-24 03:28:34	tumocs	raedah are you using old xserver and kernel?
2016-03-24 03:28:36	@Samsai	or uninstall the catalyst driver altogether and see how well the open source driver works
2016-03-24 03:28:48	tumocs	also catalyst is horrid, go with mesa
2016-03-24 03:29:52	tumocs	because you know, catalyst is shit at supporting anything new so you need to roll back to ancient xserver and kernel with arch

2016-03-24 21:57:28	tadzik	NaughtySquid: yes, I have a ticket for this too
2016-03-24 21:57:36	tadzik	I'll try to do it today
2016-03-24 21:58:13	@NaughtySquid	fab thanks dude
2016-03-24 22:00:26	FutureSuture	Arch seems to be behind Manjaro and openSUSE Tumbleweed in terms of having the latest kernel once again.
2016-03-24 22:01:43	anonkun	Currently on Manjaro
2016-03-24 22:01:46	anonkun	pretty good
2016-03-24 22:02:15	anonkun	I liked opensuse a lot as well
2016-03-24 22:02:29	anonkun	but it just didn't have all the packages I wanted and adding those one click installers broke the DE
2016-03-24 22:04:08	FutureSuture	anonkun, which packages were those?
2016-03-24 22:04:41	anonkun	Can't remember, it was almost a year ago.
2016-03-24 22:05:39	FutureSuture	And using a 1 click installer really broke the DE? Hawt dayum
2016-03-24 22:05:50	FutureSuture	Did you tell anyone in #opensuse about it?
2016-03-24 22:05:53	anonkun	using multiple ones
2016-03-24 22:05:55	anonkun	Yep
2016-03-24 22:06:04	anonkun	They said people end up adding "20 of those"
2016-03-24 22:06:09	anonkun	and their system breaks
2016-03-24 22:06:11	anonkun	so be careful
2016-03-24 22:06:12	anonkun	and I just did that
2016-03-24 22:06:25	FutureSuture	Oh, is this about repositories?
2016-03-24 22:06:41	FutureSuture	Yea, some repositories share the same packages, some newer, some older
2016-03-24 22:06:44	anonkun	i think so
2016-03-24 22:06:58	von	so, apparently payday 2 is out on linux
2016-03-24 22:07:12	von	and, of course, no way to turn off chromatic aberration, right?
2016-03-24 22:07:45	FutureSuture	anonkun, https://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories#Packman "VLC Repositories for openSUSE contains all the required libraries that are not shipped with original openSUSE. (vlc is also provided by Packman, do not mix the two)"
2016-03-24 22:07:46	GolBot	[ Additional package repositories - openSUSE ]
2016-03-24 22:07:52	FutureSuture	See the warning at the end, for example
2016-03-24 22:08:01	FutureSuture	Kinda meh that stuff like this would break the system
2016-03-24 22:09:07	anonkun	yeah, but some applications end up adding stuff that isn't entirely relevant
2016-03-24 22:09:11	anonkun	i mean repos
2016-03-24 22:09:25	anonkun	Though such combinations are possible with other distros
2016-03-24 22:09:53	anonkun	But everything else seemed perfect
2016-03-24 22:09:59	anonkun	as such
2016-03-24 22:10:30	FutureSuture	anonkun, yea, everything else does seem perfect. I like YaST.
2016-03-24 22:10:38	FutureSuture	anonkun, you using Pamac on Manjaro?
2016-03-24 22:10:43	anonkun	The 1 click install concept was amazing too
2016-03-24 22:10:45	anonkun	I use yaourt
2016-03-24 22:11:16	FutureSuture	Yaourt can be a part of Pamac. What GUI do you use for Pacman?
2016-03-24 22:11:28	anonkun	I dont. There's octopi tho.
2016-03-24 22:11:37	FutureSuture	Ah, so you're on KDE
2016-03-24 22:11:42	anonkun	yep
2016-03-24 22:11:51	anonkun	Manjaro KDE had almost everything i wanted out of the box
2016-03-24 22:11:55	anonkun	so I just went with it
2016-03-24 22:11:59	anonkun	though KDE is quite buggy
2016-03-24 22:12:08	FutureSuture	Octopi is rubbish compared to Pamac in my opinion. Even when on KDE, I uninstall Octopi and use Pamac instead.
2016-03-24 22:12:17	anonkun	just installed pamac
2016-03-24 22:12:20	anonkun	it seems so much faster
2016-03-24 22:12:25	FutureSuture	:D
2016-03-24 22:12:30	anonkun	same thing with kile
2016-03-24 22:12:34	anonkun	gummi is so much better
2016-03-24 22:12:40	anonkun	It's like in making so many applications
2016-03-24 22:12:45	anonkun	the KDE devs make them all half assed :P
2016-03-24 22:12:46	FutureSuture	I also love how it automatically gets rid of unrequired dependencies. Avoids clutter!
2016-03-24 22:12:53	anonkun	pamac does this?
2016-03-24 22:12:58	FutureSuture	Yea
2016-03-24 22:13:02	FutureSuture	It's an option

2016-03-24 22:14:04	anonkun	oh lmao the notifications icon is bugged
2016-03-24 22:14:09	anonkun	its a really really tiny red dot
2016-03-24 22:14:14	anonkun	probably because im on kde
2016-03-24 22:14:16	FutureSuture	:'-(
2016-03-24 22:14:20	anonkun	but I like it
2016-03-24 22:14:26	anonkun	pamac is laggy and annoyin
2016-03-24 22:14:31	anonkun	oops
2016-03-24 22:14:32	FutureSuture	Pamac was fine on KDE in the past. I am currently on XFCE, however.
2016-03-24 22:14:33	anonkun	I meant octopi
2016-03-24 22:14:40	FutureSuture	I intend to switch back.
2016-03-24 22:14:47	von	plasma is stable!
2016-03-24 22:14:47	anonkun	oo xfce was my fav distro
2016-03-24 22:14:51	anonkun	then I became lazy
2016-03-24 22:15:05	anonkun	von: very buggy. Type a currency in krunner. like 4USD, it wont show you other currencies :/
2016-03-24 22:15:07	FutureSuture	XFCE is second to KDE for me.
2016-03-24 22:15:14	von	that's a running joke man
2016-03-24 22:15:17	anonkun	lol
2016-03-24 22:15:21	anonkun	xD
2016-03-24 22:15:22	von	I know it's not
2016-03-24 22:16:16	FutureSuture	von, I'll join you if you stage a protest against chromatic aberration.
2016-03-24 22:16:42	von	well, from my experience with PAYDAY 2 chromatic aberration is not it's only problem

2016-03-24 22:17:04	FutureSuture	anonkun, >.>
2016-03-24 22:17:14	von	the worst problem is the fact that the game is basically a boring horde shooter
2016-03-24 22:17:15	FutureSuture	I swear, it worked several months ago!
2016-03-24 22:17:18	anonkun	but i'm still going to use it
2016-03-24 22:17:26	anonkun	that should tell you a lot about octopi
2016-03-24 22:17:32	FutureSuture	von, seems to be multiplayer only as well.
2016-03-24 22:17:42	von	there are bots
2016-03-24 22:17:46	von	but they are immensely stupid
2016-03-24 22:18:04	FutureSuture	Yea, but I want a story. A good singleplayer experience.
2016-03-24 22:18:12	von	it's not there
2016-03-24 22:18:19	von	look for it somewhere else :)
2016-03-24 22:18:26	von	wait for Tomb Raider, for instance.
2016-03-24 22:18:28	FutureSuture	Pamac is nice and simple. It's like the Transmission of package manager GUIs.
2016-03-24 22:18:36	anonkun	No
2016-03-24 22:18:41	anonkun	It's the only package manager GUI that doesn't lag.
2016-03-24 22:18:50	FutureSuture	von, I want Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.
2016-03-24 22:18:54	anonkun	and that counts for a LOT
2016-03-24 22:18:58	FutureSuture	Ha
2016-03-24 22:19:10	FutureSuture	anonkun, Antergos uses Pamac as well.
2016-03-24 22:19:14	von	ew, graphic package managers
2016-03-24 22:19:22	anonkun	ewww cli package managers

2016-03-24 22:19:27	FutureSuture	xDDD
2016-03-24 22:19:58	anonkun	I should have gone with antergos as my main distro
2016-03-24 22:19:59	anonkun	shame
2016-03-24 22:20:02	von	well, at least cli stuff works :)
2016-03-24 22:20:06	anonkun	their installer requires a net connection
2016-03-24 22:20:20	anonkun	and it got "disconnected" automatically for many people
2016-03-24 22:20:31	FutureSuture	anonkun, worked for me, luckily.
2016-03-24 22:20:33	anonkun	I don't have enough computers :(
2016-03-24 22:20:55	anonkun	Funny start to the GOL podcast

2016-03-24 22:23:30	anonkun	but hitting cancel instantly stopped it :D

2016-03-24 22:26:22	FutureSuture	anonkun, I believe so
2016-03-24 22:26:55	anonkun	I don't like AUR
2016-03-24 22:27:00	anonkun	specifically because of this
2016-03-24 22:27:14	anonkun	thankfully, debian has the packages I use now in their main repos :) so i'll be going with a *buntu

2016-03-24 23:45:43	EddDeDuck	Yeah she needed a flat mate for a flat
2016-03-24 23:45:50	EddDeDuck	after a year we got a spare room :p

2016-03-24 23:46:26	lemon_snowCone	why the fuck is so god damn hard to build ffmpeg

2016-03-24 23:46:33	EddDeDuck	The cat was not amused I stole his side of the bed and some of her affection.
2016-03-24 23:46:37	lemon_snowCone	rather cross compile ffmpeg*
2016-03-24 23:47:43	EddDeDuck	ffmpeg was one of the few projects I’ve build a few times
2016-03-24 23:47:52	EddDeDuck	*built from pure source
2016-03-24 23:48:03	EddDeDuck	Usually just go with pre built
2016-03-24 23:49:42	lemon_snowCone	well
2016-03-24 23:49:49	lemon_snowCone	I need to cross compile it for x86 android
2016-03-24 23:49:56	lemon_snowCone	ive got the libs as static libraries
2016-03-24 23:50:09	lemon_snowCone	however when it comes to linked to ffmpeg to build as a shared lib it fails
2016-03-24 23:51:25	EddDeDuck	android c support isn’t as polished as java stuff
2016-03-24 23:51:33	lemon_snowCone	well its been done before
2016-03-24 23:51:45	lemon_snowCone	and its a problem with ffmpeg 3.0 as far as I can tell
2016-03-24 23:51:54	lemon_snowCone	i think
2016-03-24 23:52:06	lemon_snowCone	FutureSuture, "Her parents just didn't want a foreigner and put a lot of pressure on her."

2016-03-24 23:59:43	FutureSuture	So did that end the relationship?
2016-03-24 23:59:49	lemon_snowCone	not really
2016-03-24 23:59:58	lemon_snowCone	she just got weird and wanted to get married to soon for my liking
2016-03-25 00:00:01	lemon_snowCone	so I ended it
2016-03-25 00:00:38	lemon_snowCone	yeah leaving university with an unaddressed drug problem, no job and  no money
2016-03-25 00:00:47	lemon_snowCone	to get married on top of that to someone ? no thanks
2016-03-25 00:01:06	FutureSuture	I am sure she would have sorted out the job and money problem

2016-03-25 05:58:46	 *	rcrit_ runs Fedora
2016-03-25 05:59:01	 *	Ysblokje runs arch ;)
2016-03-25 05:59:17	 *	Cracker run Ubuntu
2016-03-25 05:59:19	rcrit_	I think most porting companies test against SteamOS which is based on debian/ubuntu
2016-03-25 05:59:34	Ysblokje	rcrit_, most forget that part ;)
2016-03-25 05:59:55	Smilex	Insurgency!
2016-03-25 06:00:18	Smilex	add Smilex from Faroe Islands on steam
2016-03-25 06:00:47	rcrit_	but "best" I don't know. I suspect the bits are all mostly the same, if not re-arranged or configured slightly differently
2016-03-25 06:01:01	LerkIt	Smilex: Added
2016-03-25 06:01:12	rcrit_	it is said to be far easier in Ubuntu due to ease of getting drivers
2016-03-25 06:01:35	LerkIt	Hmm .. can't see Ubuntu anymore. Hows Arch in Gaming these days? Enjoyed the shit out of the distro nearly 10 years ago.
2016-03-25 06:01:59	Ysblokje	I'm enjoying it a lot
2016-03-25 06:02:05	Ysblokje	used ubuntu before that
2016-03-25 06:02:33	Ysblokje	both run games just fine
2016-03-25 06:03:34	LerkIt	Hmm
2016-03-25 06:03:41	gnarface	LerkIt: its funny, because the first commercial game support for linux was packaged as rpm because back then redhat was the de-facto standard in linux distros.  these days almost nobody uses rpm distros except windows admins doing linux duty under duress for some international megacorp
2016-03-25 06:03:58	LerkIt	Is there any installer and pre defined Gnome or Cinnamon up for Arch ... feeling so lazy ATM

2016-03-25 06:05:13	LerkIt	Wouldn't say it this way. rpm based servers are most likely certified in any way. And have a damn well support. If you run anything larger as "My privat cat homepage" as a company, chances are good, that the it is selecting CentOS or Red Hat.
2016-03-25 06:05:24	gnarface	LerkIt: in the end, its less about the distro than it is about your ability to selectively replace incompatible drivers/libraries with the right version

2016-03-25 06:07:23	stqn	it’s not much work :p
2016-03-25 06:07:38	Ysblokje	okay excluding lfs and gentoo :D
2016-03-25 06:07:54	stqn	to be fair, the second time is much faster :)
2016-03-25 06:08:15	gnarface	i'll attest to that
2016-03-25 06:08:34	gnarface	but i'm still standing by my strong recommendation of *any debian or derivative* instead
2016-03-25 06:09:47	stqn	yeah, I wasn’t seriously suggesting Gentoo, although games do work and you can easily choose your video drivers.
2016-03-25 06:10:10	gnarface	(for the primary reason that most gaming-related issues can be fixed without manually recompiling your kernel and half of the userspace libraries, and for the secondary reason that if there is a problem i'm more likely to be able to help fix it)
2016-03-25 06:10:59	stqn	…
2016-03-25 06:11:00	calexil	have they fixed obs and mesa-ati yet?

2016-03-25 06:11:15	stqn	you don’t have to rebuild anything to play games

2016-03-25 06:13:04	gnarface	stqn: i'm pretty sure you had to build the whole thing just to install it, and that type of semantic word-game doesn't fly with me.
2016-03-25 06:13:06	LerkIt	stqn: Gentoo user here. Can't see your point.
2016-03-25 06:13:17	mirv_	gnarface, no, you don't rebuild it all these days
2016-03-25 06:13:23	mirv_	well you can (and I do for the fun of it)
2016-03-25 06:13:31	mirv_	but stage3 tarballs are used (binary)
2016-03-25 06:13:34	stqn	gnarface: I see you’re on a FUD crusade today, whatever.
2016-03-25 06:13:47	gnarface	wait gentoo has a fully-binary distro now?
2016-03-25 06:13:52	mirv_	no
2016-03-25 06:13:57	mirv_	but the base install is binary
2016-03-25 06:14:10	gnarface	oh, so you do still have to build most of your userland libraries
2016-03-25 06:14:13	LerkIt	gnarface, since 8+ years. Google for Sabayon
2016-03-25 06:14:23	gnarface	LerkIt: a fork
2016-03-25 06:14:37	mirv_	gnarface, most of the userland, yes, but you get to choose which ones
2016-03-25 06:14:47	mirv_	by that point, getting X up & running is pretty quick
2016-03-25 06:14:50	mirv_	no bloat
2016-03-25 06:14:55	gnarface	mirv_: ok, so just making sure that my statement is 100% accurate and its YOU GUYS spreading fud

2016-03-25 06:19:00	gnarface	look, everyone can use what distro they want.  but my advice still stands; if you want to game on linux these days with the least drama, choose devuan jessie and steam.
2016-03-25 06:19:26	calexil	devuan? is that like french debian
2016-03-25 06:19:29	mirv_	you can pretty much choose whichever distro you want
2016-03-25 06:19:31	gnarface	calexil: italian
2016-03-25 06:20:09	calexil	mint+steam=decent
2016-03-25 06:20:18	mirv_	I've had exactly one problem with gentoo and games, and even then it wasn't actually specifically related to gentoo
2016-03-25 06:20:19	frostwork	just use the distro you like most and *fixed*...
2016-03-25 06:20:31	calexil	so I shit myself this morning
2016-03-25 06:20:41	calexil	just a lil squirt
2016-03-25 06:20:45	calexil	thought twas a fart
2016-03-25 06:20:51	mirv_	it was back when gentoo used emul-* libs for 32bit stuff
2016-03-25 06:20:56	calexil	sorely disappointed
2016-03-25 06:20:57	frostwork	hrhr
2016-03-25 06:21:19	calexil	thats a terribad way to wake up
2016-03-25 06:21:22	gnarface	frostwork: yes, that's true, except in the conversation where someone who doesn't know what they prefer just wants to "play games" easily, i think is irresponsible to recommend a non-debian derivative in an environment where most of the games default target a debian derivative distro
2016-03-25 06:21:26	calexil	'oops i just shit myself'
2016-03-25 06:22:11	mirv_	gnarface, strictly speaking, if they don't care about the underlying OS...well it is easier with something else
2016-03-25 06:22:11	Smilex	I think I'm going Linux from scratch next time I bother switch distro. I've lost confidence in package managers
2016-03-25 06:22:22	calexil	ohhhh boy
2016-03-25 06:22:23	calexil	dont
2016-03-25 06:22:35	calexil	you will flip that sentiment right the fuck around
2016-03-25 06:22:39	mirv_	Smilex, try Funtoo
2016-03-25 06:22:45	calexil	the first time you try to get something working
2016-03-25 06:22:49	@Samsai	calexil, it's Smilex we are talking about
2016-03-25 06:22:59	gnarface	mirv_: well i assume a base minimum understanding of "but not a commercial OS" by context of the fact they're asking in #gamingonlinux
2016-03-25 06:23:00	calexil	tru
2016-03-25 06:23:00	frostwork	gnarface, haven't followed the whole discussion. I guess the problem was "you have to rebuild the system" to play games vs "you have to build the system". but not sure, and I don't care too much tbh :}
2016-03-25 06:23:09	stqn	Smilex: don’t try Funtoo before you’re familiar with Gentoo ;)
2016-03-25 06:23:10	@Samsai	tbh i'm surprised he hasn't gone with LFS by now
2016-03-25 06:23:25	Smilex	stqn: I used Gentoo for quite awhile. And many times
2016-03-25 06:23:30	stqn	Smilex: oh good.
2016-03-25 06:23:58	Smilex	I really should write down issues I have with things. I know Gentoo leaves a bad taste everytime, but I go back when I forget
2016-03-25 06:24:18	gnarface	frostwork: that was exactly my argument, yes.  reducing exposure of new users to the need to manually rebuild packages just to gain compatibility with steam or steam games
2016-03-25 06:24:30	Smilex	Samsai: I believe too much
2016-03-25 06:24:59	gnarface	frostwork: nothing scares someone back to windows faster than learning they have to learn how to rebuild libGSWhatever and all its dependencies just to get steam to launch
2016-03-25 06:25:10	mirv_	gnarface, you don't need to rebuild packages to gain compatibility with steam or steam games
2016-03-25 06:25:18	mirv_	that's the whole point of the steam runtime
2016-03-25 06:25:37	frostwork	gnarface, it is usually not necessary to rebuild parts of your system to get a steamgame running, but sure, a newbie shouldn't start with gentoo if his main goal is to play steamgames
2016-03-25 06:25:39	gnarface	mirv_: and its generally a failure at that
2016-03-25 06:25:54	mirv_	gentoo requires you to build things in the first place, but saying you have to rebuild them for games? that's false
2016-03-25 06:26:14	mirv_	with the sole exception of one problem I mentioned above
2016-03-25 06:26:16	Smilex	mirv_: it's not false if the game requires the package built with a flag that it was not built with
2016-03-25 06:26:33	mirv_	sigh, steam runtime takes care of that
2016-03-25 06:26:45	Smilex	which has happened to me a lot of times, but I also ran Gentoo on a pentium 4, so I turned everyting off always
2016-03-25 06:26:46	frostwork	if you have to rebuild or install additional system libs the game packager failed
2016-03-25 06:26:57	Smilex	oh didn't know you were talking about steam runtime, sorry
2016-03-25 06:26:58	mirv_	I replace libgcc and libstdc++  (remove them) because mesa built from source doesn't place nice
2016-03-25 06:27:00	gnarface	mirv_: but saying "rebuild" is different from "build in the first place" from a level of effort is, while true semantically, in the strictest sense, utterly an irrelevant hair-splitting argument from a factual "level of effort" sense
2016-03-25 06:27:01	mirv_	that's it
2016-03-25 06:27:02	mirv_	nothing else
2016-03-25 06:27:33	mirv_	gnarface, it's a bloody important distinction
2016-03-25 06:27:48	mirv_	there are in libs I don't need to install at all myself
2016-03-25 06:27:51	gnarface	mirv_: not to someone who is asking the question "which distro should i pick so i can game easily on"

2016-03-25 06:28:17	@Samsai	nobody
2016-03-25 06:28:21	mirv_	yes, and they'll be able to install a different distro easier
2016-03-25 06:28:30	gnarface	mirv_: that was my only point
2016-03-25 06:28:32	mirv_	so it's ease of distro setup in the first place that's the problem
2016-03-25 06:28:33	kkit	my first distro was gentoo
2016-03-25 06:28:34	kkit	:(
2016-03-25 06:28:43	frostwork	using gentoo since 2003
2016-03-25 06:28:47	mirv_	so let's stop saying you need to rebuild gentoo just to play games
2016-03-25 06:29:12	gnarface	Samsai: i would say there is a case for introducing it as a first distro in a controlled environment like a classroom, but other than that, i agree with this sentiment
2016-03-25 06:29:50	@Samsai	gnarface, i don't believe it should be the first distro even in a classroom
2016-03-25 06:29:53	mirv_	everyone should try different distros, and switch to something they're comfortable with

2016-03-25 06:30:45	frostwork	no idea what that whole discussion is about. simply bored or pissed of as there are no game news? :}
2016-03-25 06:31:11	mirv_	to be fair, gentoo might be great to show and teach about GNU/Linux in general

2016-03-25 06:42:03	@Samsai	i hope larabel at least reported it too
2016-03-25 06:42:05	mirv_	eventually it will wrap around
2016-03-25 06:42:15	@Samsai	fuck, he didn't
2016-03-25 06:42:17	dabblers-buffet	I was thinking I could make a tower of CPUs.
2016-03-25 06:42:23	dabblers-buffet	Like glue one on top of each other.
2016-03-25 06:42:53	mirv_	just to make things weird here...
2016-03-25 06:43:01	mirv_	dabblers-buffet, make them into nipple clamps
2016-03-25 06:43:04	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: if you know a good chemist, its possible to use some very hazardous chemicals to melt all the gold off them too, but a lot of the gold was on the pins....
2016-03-25 06:43:15	dabblers-buffet	Pentium 4 processors barely have any gold on them.
2016-03-25 06:43:28	dabblers-buffet	Earlier CPUs like the Pentium Pro, i486, & older have more gold on them.
2016-03-25 06:43:54	dabblers-buffet	Mostly the contact pins on a pentium 4 are usually a bunch of different alloys like tin, copper, etc...
2016-03-25 06:43:56	kkit	aqua regia will take off more than gold
2016-03-25 06:44:07	kkit	and that's pretty much all that will dissolve gold
2016-03-25 06:44:51	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: oh, the chemicals cost more than the gold, to be sure, its absolutely not profitable, but it IS one of the few ways you can get nearly pure lab-grade gold for yourself from trash....
2016-03-25 06:45:20	dabblers-buffet	If you seen the Pentium Pro processors with the gold lids & gold contact pins, they can weigh to around 1g of gold.
2016-03-25 06:45:32	dabblers-buffet	Which is a good amount of money.

2016-03-25 06:46:37	dabblers-buffet	Yeah.
2016-03-25 06:46:51	gnarface	nerdy keychains or christmas ornaments
2016-03-25 06:47:06	kkit	gnarface: it isn't more complicated than that. maybe warming it to speed up the reaction
2016-03-25 06:47:32	dabblers-buffet	I think I'll make a tower out of them.
2016-03-25 06:47:39	dabblers-buffet	I'll have to see how many of them I have.
2016-03-25 06:47:46	gnarface	kkit: if you want the gold pure it obviously must be
2016-03-25 06:47:51	dabblers-buffet	But the keychain/ornament idea was great. :)
2016-03-25 06:47:57	dabblers-buffet	I'll save that for next time.
2016-03-25 06:48:07	kkit	but if you want to then seperate it, you have to selectively remove the other stuff
2016-03-25 06:48:26	kkit	that's where the complication comes in

2016-03-25 06:52:38	kkit	it's hydrochloric and nitric acid
2016-03-25 06:52:38	dabblers-buffet	I think aqua regia involves hydrogen peroxide & muriatic acid, right?

2016-03-25 06:56:07	gnarface	kkit: in most 1st-world countries its not considered profitable enough to use this process on used computers, mostly they only use it on giant piles of rocks
2016-03-25 06:56:28	gnarface	its a neat science experiment though
2016-03-25 06:56:37	kkit	are the computer dumps in africa and southeast asia using cyanide to process computer waste?
2016-03-25 06:57:25	gnarface	kkit: no i think they're just literally mining them for usable components for resale actually.  the only place i heard of ever actually mining the used hardware for precious metals was some small scandanavian country
2016-03-25 06:58:02	gnarface	maybe sweden?
2016-03-25 06:58:05	gnarface	it was a while back
2016-03-25 06:58:16	gnarface	i wouldn't be surprised if they're doing it in china too though
2016-03-25 06:58:23	dabblers-buffet	You guys know VR? Well, I read some history about it & it dates back to the 1950s when the Sensorama came out.
2016-03-25 06:58:56	kkit	or the nintendo virtual boy
2016-03-25 06:59:05	dabblers-buffet	That was made in the 90s.
2016-03-25 06:59:27	kkit	yeah but the virtual boy is the first one by one of the modern gaming companies
2016-03-25 06:59:28	dabblers-buffet	Once again, thank you Toms Hardware for that.
2016-03-25 06:59:33	gnarface	kkit: i could be wrong, but my assumption is that if there were places in africa where gold cyanidation was actually profitable, they wouldn't be mining diamonds out of the mud with wicker baskets

2016-03-25 07:03:14	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: i think it would apply well to just about any FPS; what i haven't seen yet are any good displays
2016-03-25 07:03:43	gnarface	maybe the HTC "Vive" will turn out to be better than expected
2016-03-25 07:03:55	dabblers-buffet	Maybe both of the LCD displays in the VR device could be 2560x1440 each.
2016-03-25 07:04:01	dabblers-buffet	They'd add up to 4K.

2016-03-25 07:05:45	dabblers-buffet	It wasn't a VR device per se, but it defined motion tracking for VR devices later on.
2016-03-25 07:06:01	dabblers-buffet	So that the manufacturers could improve on them.
2016-03-25 07:06:05	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: yea, i was so proud of owning one.  everyone was jealous.  there weren't any good games for it though really
2016-03-25 07:06:17	dabblers-buffet	How much did it cost back then to get one?
2016-03-25 07:06:19	dabblers-buffet	In 1989?
2016-03-25 07:06:38	gnarface	man i forget, it wasn't cheap though.  i think it cost almost as much as the nintendo did, maybe more

2016-03-25 08:30:12	dabblers-buffet	Did you put most of your text & logos in the middle?
2016-03-25 08:30:28	@Samsai	dabblers-buffet, the most important stuff goes to the mobile area
2016-03-25 08:30:38	@Samsai	additional social media icons to the desktop area
2016-03-25 08:30:53	@Samsai	fancy stuff to the television area
2016-03-25 08:32:17	dabblers-buffet	Let's say I have text saying "Dabbler's Buffet, Technology, Gaming, Music & More" & a picture of me in the banner, I'd put that stuff in the middle right?

2016-03-25 08:32:39	@Samsai	if everyone has to be able to see it, it goes to the middle
2016-03-25 08:32:46	dabblers-buffet	What fancy stuff by the way would go in the TV area?
2016-03-25 08:33:10	@Samsai	basically anything that is not in any way important
2016-03-25 08:33:37	@Samsai	nobody watches videos on the tv interface so you might even get away with putting straight-up porn in the television area
2016-03-25 08:33:51	@Samsai	not that i recommend doing that of course

2016-03-25 08:46:19	dabblers-buffet	Hey Samsai: For your channel banner, since you used that template, did you turn down the opacity of the template & put your stuff in the middle?
2016-03-25 08:46:38	dabblers-buffet	Or did you remove the text from the middle & put your stuff there?
2016-03-25 08:47:22	@Samsai	dabblers-buffet, i toggled the visibility of all the layers in that template when i was done setting things up
2016-03-25 08:47:46	@Samsai	you obviously don't want the boxes in your final product
2016-03-25 08:48:08	dabblers-buffet	So you basically made the whole template invisible & put your stuff there & then saved the photo?
2016-03-25 08:48:20	ky0	evening
2016-03-25 08:49:10	@Samsai	dabblers-buffet, more like put my stuff there and then made the template visible
2016-03-25 08:49:33	@Samsai	you need the boxes to get the sizes and locations of your logos and texts right
2016-03-25 08:49:59	@Samsai	yay, i finally managed to do the complete ritual of binding
2016-03-25 08:50:22	@Samsai	used a bunch of glitches to do it but at least i have now gotten the good ending of eldritch
2016-03-25 08:50:57	gnarface	NaughtySquid: they added it in a later version, but it implies the first one
2016-03-25 08:51:12	dabblers-buffet	Would it be fine if I tweaked the opacity of the template down to 50-75% & then add my stuff in there?
2016-03-25 08:51:41	dabblers-buffet	I was thinking putting black bars on the top & bottom rectangles.
2016-03-25 08:52:15	@Samsai	dabblers-buffet, that's a good way to do it

2016-03-25 08:53:19	@Samsai	dabblers-buffet, i used the opacity method
2016-03-25 08:53:28	@Samsai	black bars might be a bit troublesome
2016-03-25 08:53:52	dabblers-buffet	I could put a gradient there.
2016-03-25 08:54:11	dabblers-buffet	That way if people do view the background on a 1440p TV/Monitor, they could see the gradient.

2016-03-25 09:21:46	dabblers-buffet	I'm back.
2016-03-25 09:22:05	dabblers-buffet	But I wanted to ask a question, how do you completely remove a background with a person in it?
2016-03-25 09:22:17	dabblers-buffet	That doesn't only have one color?
2016-03-25 09:22:21	dabblers-buffet	With GIMP?
2016-03-25 09:23:29	gnarface	you could zoom in and use the lasso tool to carefully trace the edge of the subject you want to cut out
2016-03-25 09:24:32	gnarface	in general its a good idea to try to get a solid color background though, even if its not perfect you can use the solid color selection tool with an adjusted tolerance threshold and get most of the background
2016-03-25 09:24:37	gnarface	then you only have to trim a little bit
2016-03-25 09:24:54	gnarface	its not as good as having a proper greenscreen background

2016-03-25 09:25:41	gnarface	solid color selection tool by that i mean "magic wand" i think its called
2016-03-25 09:26:20	gnarface	on mine they're labeled fuzzy select tool and free select tool i guess
2016-03-25 09:26:39	dabblers-buffet	I have a chroma key background I can use.
2016-03-25 09:26:48	dabblers-buffet	a 6x9' one.
2016-03-25 09:27:00	dabblers-buffet	I was thinking about using that instead.
2016-03-25 09:27:08	dabblers-buffet	That way it'd be much easier to cut myself out of the picture.
2016-03-25 09:27:51	gnarface	under enough light, any matte color solid flat panel should work
2016-03-25 09:28:13	gnarface	definitely easier if its some color that is far from anything on the object of course
2016-03-25 09:28:39	dabblers-buffet	Thank you.

2016-03-25 21:54:38	tadzik	and there's a fuckton of windows trolls on steam forums, news at 11
2016-03-25 21:55:09	mETz	so you didn't even read the post? ;)
2016-03-25 21:55:13	tadzik	I did
2016-03-25 21:55:25	tadzik	and from what I saw the last one marked [developer] said "it's in our plans"
2016-03-25 21:55:30	tadzik	did I miss something?
2016-03-25 21:55:44	tadzik	no, I did not
2016-03-25 21:56:04	Ysblokje	a) its old news b) its not off the table
2016-03-25 21:56:15	mETz	yeah, but with the developer working on the port being gone it will take even longer
2016-03-25 21:57:00	tadzik	for what we know they may already have a new one
2016-03-25 21:57:01	mETz	and given how much planned content and gameplay is missing the game will stay early access for ages
2016-03-25 21:57:08	tadzik	or decided to abandon the port and be silent about it
2016-03-25 21:57:16	tadzik	I don't see the point of drawing conclusions from lack of information
2016-03-25 21:58:00	anonkun	What are devs saying about vulkan?
2016-03-25 21:58:14	tadzik	nothing
2016-03-25 21:58:22	tadzik	and since they're using UE3, it's likely to stay that way :)
2016-03-25 21:58:40	anonkun	UE3 supports vulkan right?

2016-03-25 21:58:54	tadzik	neitehr
2016-03-25 21:59:00	anonkun	oh
2016-03-25 21:59:04	tadzik	ue4 has plans for it, that's it
2016-03-25 21:59:06	anonkun	the unreal engine doesnt have vulkan support?
2016-03-25 21:59:08	anonkun	ouch
2016-03-25 21:59:17	anonkun	so that way we will never see vulkan games lol
2016-03-25 21:59:18	tadzik	vulkan came out like a month ago
2016-03-25 21:59:21	tadzik	why is it surprising
2016-03-25 21:59:36	anonkun	There was a UE4 presentation that demonstrated or stated it supports vulkan
2016-03-25 21:59:41	anonkun	I think
2016-03-25 21:59:44	tadzik	millions of lines of code won't magically write themselves because a *specification* was released
2016-03-25 21:59:50	anonkun	true true
2016-03-25 22:00:00	tadzik	they do have some preliminary (?) support, but nothing final to show
2016-03-25 22:00:05	anonkun	lemme check it ky0
2016-03-25 22:01:25	anonkun	seems like a fun game
2016-03-25 22:01:51	anonkun	Though i'm out of money until the next 2 weeks so...
2016-03-25 22:02:43	tadzik	I'll wait for reviews :)

2016-03-26 03:12:47	homerj	yeah, MATLAB is more numerical analysis and number crunching
2016-03-26 03:13:00	homerj	vs a Mathematica/Sage which is just "math"
2016-03-26 03:14:32	homerj	MATLAB also has Simulink, which as far as I know, doesn't have an open source analog

2016-03-26 03:19:22	homerj	like you had race data in a database, and select a stint
2016-03-26 03:19:37	homerj	and then have it crunch all the data and plot it
2016-03-26 03:20:10	homerj	that used to be one of the shortcomings with R, until Shiny

2016-03-26 03:23:49	homerj	because there's a lot of nice open source math stuff, but then no real way to combine it all
2016-03-26 03:23:51	homerj	that's what Sage does
2016-03-26 03:24:07	homerj	they aren't reinventing the wheel mathematically
2016-03-26 03:24:12	linux_gamer	i like R, but in numerics Matlab is more used at my uni
2016-03-26 03:24:45	homerj	so there's some really nice thing out there for whatever, but it's in Fortran
2016-03-26 03:24:54	homerj	then it's included in Sage, and then you just use Python on it
2016-03-26 03:25:02	linux_gamer	fortran is like C just for nerds
2016-03-26 03:25:42	homerj	that's what I say it's more of a distribution than a program
2016-03-26 03:25:44	homerj	and why it's huge
2016-03-26 03:26:10	homerj	but it works really well
2016-03-26 03:26:19	qptain_Nemo	i'd say fortran is more of basic for nerds
2016-03-26 03:26:35	dabblers-buffet	Anybody heard of a game called The Brookhaven Experiment?
2016-03-26 03:26:36	homerj	I didn't use it for my racing stuff, because Octave/R is more of what I needed
2016-03-26 03:27:09	homerj	but I have used Sage for Kerbal
2016-03-26 03:28:27	homerj	the kind of real issue with this stuff, is a lot like the program of GIMP vs. Photoshop
2016-03-26 03:29:00	homerj	if you use it on its own, you pretty much get feature parity, but you generally use it in some sort of workflow, and can't really just drop it in

2016-03-26 06:07:58	homerj	is Guild Wars 2 even relevant anymore?
2016-03-26 06:08:02	Dezponia	anonkun: Obviously because they are all secretly developing their GNU/Linux ports and are just collectively waiting to release them all together in a "every game ever made for every platform ever now on GNU/Linux" humble bundle. Mark this day as the day I called it
2016-03-26 06:08:32	anonkun	I think you are a little off

2016-03-26 06:13:56	Dezponia	I'm just having fun backing up my DVD collection and enjoying some of the more... exotic DRM tech some people have come up with
2016-03-26 06:14:10	Dezponia	Like this disc thats apparently 72GB in size
2016-03-26 06:18:20	anonkun	sorry
2016-03-26 06:18:25	anonkun	was writing gaben an email
2016-03-26 06:18:48	Dezponia	It appears they have looped to the same physical file on the disc but with new filenames constantly in the UDF filesystem. Then they made each of those "files" (all the filenames) required by calling them from the DVD menu depending on what selection is made.
2016-03-26 06:19:11	Dezponia	I wonder if there is a program to simply edit the DVD menu files to ask for the original files so it will still work without all those different filenames
2016-03-26 06:19:53	Dezponia	Right now if you try to back up that DVD it'll actually create a 72GB backup (which also takes a ton of time because of the intentional, fake corrupted sectors on the disc, common DVD "protection")
2016-03-26 06:20:32	Dezponia	anonkun: What ere you writing him about?
2016-03-26 06:23:08	homerj	he got an artificial womb implanted and wants to have his baby

2016-03-26 06:29:05	Dezponia	stqn: I try to avoid using proprietary software when possible. Secondly it cant make backups of DVD's, only MKV files which is not what I want :)
2016-03-26 06:29:42	Dezponia	stqn: dvdbackup is a nice little program for backing up DVD discs though :)
2016-03-26 06:29:58	stqn	ok.
2016-03-26 06:30:18	stqn	makemkv works very well though, if you just want to actual movies

2016-03-26 06:33:07	Dezponia	stqn: Sure, but this is a backup in the very strict sense of the word. I want clean copy of the original incase the disc gets damaged etc for my "Archive" folder on my NAS. Same reason I use FLAC for CD's and then re-encode them if I desperatly need something else :)
2016-03-26 06:34:07	Dezponia	What I really miss right now is a free software alternative to MakeMKV for backing up blurays. With libbluray and libaacs there is really no problem playing blurays on GNU/Linux using only free software. And with Handbrake you can even back them up into a mkv or whatever file since it uses libbluray to read the disc. But there is no way to simply backup and "dump" the decrypted disc using it yet
2016-03-26 06:36:21	stqn	I thought makemkv had some special magic to get rid of the DRM
2016-03-26 06:37:55	Dezponia	stqn: Not really. bluray uses AACS for its DRM. VLC made a free software implementation called libaacs which can read past it. BUT you have to supply the key file for it to work (widely available online)
2016-03-26 06:38:49	Dezponia	stqn: Overall Blurays DRM is actually quite brilliantly designed but in the end the final disc is pressed and sold and cant be changed. That means there is always a "final" key that actually does the decryption for each disc
2016-03-26 06:39:23	gnarface	Marezz: if you want, i can probably start another game later today too, but i assume you'll be asleep by then?
2016-03-26 06:39:47	Dezponia	stqn: So regardless of how much they blacklist the "master keys" which leak from time to time the "Volume Unique Key" (VUK) for each disc will always remain the same and cant be revoked. So get a file with all known VUK keys and you're golden
2016-03-26 06:40:25	stqn	Dezponia: hm, ok…
2016-03-26 06:40:44	stqn	I’ll keep on using makemkv anyway, at least as long as it’s free

2016-03-26 17:19:19	AciD`	...or a game that needs more visibility (ie more players in case of awesomenauts, being an online only type of game)
2016-03-26 17:19:26	AciD`	(and dota/lol being free)
2016-03-26 17:20:16	stqn	yeah, I agree that new multiplayer-only games should be priced very low to get many players…
2016-03-26 17:20:55	stqn	but still if I see 1 or 2€ … must be crap
2016-03-26 17:20:56	stqn	:)
2016-03-26 17:21:40	AciD`	so...free games like Dota are uber crap?
2016-03-26 17:22:15	AciD`	I fail to see the relation between price and quality, specially in our days of free-to-play games
2016-03-26 17:22:15	stqn	you can try them without paying

2016-03-29 06:40:11	gnarface	well said
2016-03-29 06:41:28	Smilex	At the moment I agree with that person. How can Linux ever be used if you can't trust shit. Antimicro doesn't exist anymore, and compiling it gives me a list of code errors

2016-03-29 06:46:58	Smilex	it worked and there's no reason to remove it
2016-03-29 06:48:08	gnarface	maybe its not their choice
2016-03-29 06:48:17	gnarface	maybe the project maintainer closed it
2016-03-29 06:48:29	Smilex	closed it?
2016-03-29 06:49:02	gnarface	he could have discontinued the software, then the distro may have dropped it if it didn't compile.  you said yourself it didn't compile
2016-03-29 06:49:14	Smilex	actually I don't care. I want to play a game. This is getting too much
2016-03-29 06:49:28	Smilex	gnarface: Ok sure. Things are unstable as shit
2016-03-29 06:49:43	gnarface	i'm not finding any reasoning behind the discontinuation of it or any news of it being renamed either...
2016-03-29 06:49:50	Smilex	I don't want to throw blame. I only want to fucking play my games
2016-03-29 06:49:56	gnarface	if it weren't for the google record pointing to the git page i wouldn't even know it existed
2016-03-29 06:50:06	gnarface	what is your controller?
2016-03-29 06:50:30	Smilex	there's not much more to it. Just have what worked for me last week, still work. Just because I autoremove, as is recommended, doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to use my controller anymore
2016-03-29 06:51:11	Smilex	I don't know why I'm surprised. The linux eco system is completely flawed. I should just be expecting it at all times
2016-03-29 06:51:33	gnarface	well, to be fair you should always check what it says its gonna remove before you let it
2016-03-29 06:51:35	Smilex	gnarface: a PS2 controller. Either way, anti micro translates to keyboard input
2016-03-29 06:51:42	Smilex	so does QJoyPad, but it also won't work
2016-03-29 06:51:48	Smilex	neither will joy2key
2016-03-29 06:51:59	gnarface	does it need to be translated to keyboard input?
2016-03-29 06:52:06	gnarface	there's a gamepad driver for that isn't there?
2016-03-29 06:52:22	gnarface	wouldn't that be better, so you have analog action on the joysticks?
2016-03-29 06:52:32	Smilex	gnarface: the game doesn't support it, I think

2016-03-29 07:04:30	Smilex	karolherbst: there are a few, they don't work
2016-03-29 07:04:44	karolherbst	well I use xbindkeys to map actions to my additional mouse buttons
2016-03-29 07:05:24	karolherbst	well I map key combinations to be honest
2016-03-29 07:06:11	karolherbst	Smilex: basically you just want to map your gamepad to keys, right?
2016-03-29 07:06:50	Smilex	karolherbst: yeah, I'm looking at xbindkeys atm. Can't figure it out
2016-03-29 07:07:00	karolherbst	right, it is a bit tricky
2016-03-29 07:07:06	Smilex	oh didn't see the bottom buttons
2016-03-29 07:07:10	karolherbst	my only rule is this:
2016-03-29 07:07:12	karolherbst	"xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key F8' 'keyup Control_L'"
2016-03-29 07:07:15	karolherbst	 b:10
2016-03-29 07:07:23	karolherbst	that basically means, run the xte command on button:10
2016-03-29 07:07:43	karolherbst	but I am sure you can run whatever
2016-03-29 07:07:51	Smilex	of course it crashes if I try "Get Key"
2016-03-29 07:07:53	karolherbst	and with xev you get the X events you need
2016-03-29 07:08:47	karolherbst	why do you want to use Get Key?
2016-03-29 07:08:47	Smilex	xev doesn't produce events from my controller
2016-03-29 07:08:54	karolherbst	uhhh
2016-03-29 07:09:10	Smilex	to press a button on my controller and assign it? I don't know
2016-03-29 07:09:13	karolherbst	what gamepad driver are you using?
2016-03-29 07:09:31	Smilex	xpad

2016-03-29 07:10:18	karolherbst	yeah well
2016-03-29 07:11:10	karolherbst	I hope you don't use the joystick X driver

2016-03-29 07:21:02	karolherbst	mhh
2016-03-29 07:21:11	karolherbst	then I would assume something is odd with your setup
2016-03-29 07:21:38	karolherbst	Smilex: when you plug your gamepad, you should see something like "input: Microsoft X-Box 360 pad as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:1.0/input/input50" in dmesg

2016-03-29 07:26:34	karolherbst	this is for keyboards

2016-03-29 07:26:52	karolherbst	everythins is better than usbhid for gamepads
2016-03-29 07:27:13	Smilex	well I just installed xpad. Should I reboot?
2016-03-29 07:27:21	karolherbst	modprobe it
2016-03-29 07:27:29	karolherbst	and then reconnect the gamepad
2016-03-29 07:27:41	karolherbst	but usually the kernel should give you xpad already...
2016-03-29 07:28:16	karolherbst	well usb_hid isn't as bad as I say, but it is used for like everything without a special driver, and so is its feature set
2016-03-29 07:28:35	karolherbst	if you want something fancy like LEDs or rumble, usb_hid can't do that
2016-03-29 07:29:33	Smilex	still usb_hid
2016-03-29 07:29:39	karolherbst	Smilex: also it could be that your usb device/vendor ids aren't inside xpad

2016-03-29 07:40:38	karolherbst	Smilex: can you give me ls -la /dev/input ?
2016-03-29 07:40:59	karolherbst	you need write access to the js* and event* files if you want to be able to rumble
2016-03-29 07:41:16	karolherbst	either through a group or some other insecure alternative
2016-03-29 07:41:49	Smilex	ok cool, got qjoypad working with the --notray option
2016-03-29 07:42:06	karolherbst	Smilex: also if you plug out/plug in, does besides a js0 file also a event* file appear/disappear?
2016-03-29 07:42:09	karolherbst	that latter one is important

2016-03-29 07:59:16	dabblers-buffet	I just got done with my first video, I'll be posting it on YouTube today.

2016-03-29 08:33:46	Smilex	I say naming, but they added a v5 to the name. Maybe because the API changed
2016-03-29 08:37:11	stqn	mirv_: this page https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nouveau_%26_Nvidia_Switching says we should blacklist the nvidia and nouveau modules, but you say it’s not needed?

2016-03-29 08:48:38	karolherbst	this makes things a bit easier
2016-03-29 08:49:03	karolherbst	stqn: in the end you either blacklist nouveau or nvidia
2016-03-29 08:49:21	karolherbst	if you use nouveau, remove any xorg.conf files and select the opengl stuff to be xorg-x11 (or whatever it is called)
2016-03-29 08:49:30	karolherbst	the other way you know
2016-03-29 08:50:37	stqn	looks like it wouldn't be too hard to automate that at boot based on the bootmenu entry
2016-03-29 08:52:01	stqn	I don’t think I’ll do that tonight though

2016-03-29 08:53:21	stqn	karolherbst: what gpu do you have? how well is it working with full reclocking?
2016-03-29 08:53:43	karolherbst	770M
2016-03-29 08:53:45	karolherbst	quite well
2016-03-29 08:54:05	karolherbst	some games have only 30% performance (saints row IV), where some other games have more like 70%, which is rather the general case
2016-03-29 08:54:29	karolherbst	there is still a lot to do on the mesa side, but with proper reclocking nouveau gets above 50% quite often
2016-03-29 08:54:48	Smilex	what does reclocking mean?
2016-03-29 08:54:51	karolherbst	and 50% is somewhat the line where nouveau is actually usefull
2016-03-29 08:54:56	karolherbst	Smilex: changing engines and memory clocks?
2016-03-29 08:55:21	Smilex	oh so Mesa has game specific settings?
2016-03-29 08:55:21	stqn	Smilex: my understanding is it’s like cpufreq but for the gpu
2016-03-29 08:55:26	karolherbst	Smilex: no
2016-03-29 08:55:33	karolherbst	Smilex: we just don't use all the hardware features
2016-03-29 08:55:53	karolherbst	stqn: yeah well, currently more like a static clocker
2016-03-29 08:55:56	Smilex	stqn: yeah I don't know that either
2016-03-29 08:56:02	Smilex	never overclocked or anything
2016-03-29 08:56:04	karolherbst	stqn: I have a WIP dynamic reclocking commit, but it needs to be tested
2016-03-29 08:56:10	stqn	karolherbst: ah ok
2016-03-29 08:56:14	karolherbst	the nvidia gpus, can't dynamically reclock
2016-03-29 08:56:18	karolherbst	the driver needs to do that
2016-03-29 08:56:46	karolherbst	well we think with maxwell they actually can to some degree, but nobody investigated this yet
2016-03-29 08:56:56	stqn	Smilex: cpufreq is not about overclocking, but downclocking when the cpu doesn’t need its full power
2016-03-29 08:57:09	qptain_Nemo	(or not downclocking)
2016-03-29 08:57:12	stqn	Smilex: it also reduces the voltage
2016-03-29 08:57:13	Smilex	oh so is this about power saving?
2016-03-29 08:57:17	stqn	yes
2016-03-29 08:57:45	karolherbst	stqn: not right
2016-03-29 08:57:59	karolherbst	stqn: cpufreq is about using the highest clock with an actual benefit and don't clock too high
2016-03-29 08:58:18	karolherbst	ohh wait
2016-03-29 08:58:20	karolherbst	you said that
2016-03-29 08:58:23	karolherbst	my mistake
2016-03-29 08:58:27	karolherbst	I missed or added a word somewhere
2016-03-29 08:58:43	karolherbst	well the fun part is
2016-03-29 08:58:49	karolherbst	with nvidia gpus you do that all in the driver
2016-03-29 08:58:53	karolherbst	clocking/volting...
2016-03-29 09:00:59	stqn	it used to be possible in cpufreq too, I had a patched module a long time ago to downvolt my pentium-m
2016-03-29 09:01:25	karolherbst	phc-intel?
2016-03-29 09:01:49	stqn	there was a frequency/voltage table in the code, if I remember correctly
2016-03-29 09:02:01	karolherbst	yeah something like that
2016-03-29 09:02:03	stqn	no, not phc. speedstep something
2016-03-29 09:02:15	karolherbst	for nvidia gpus, it is all in the vbios and the vbios is a mess
2016-03-29 09:02:29	stqn	it was an official kernel module but I had to patch it anyway to make it work on my cpu
2016-03-29 09:03:42	karolherbst	hh right

2016-03-29 10:04:33	vale42	no i use the wine from playonlinux
2016-03-29 10:04:39	gnarface	oh, right
2016-03-29 10:04:45	vale42	but tired with the orginal wine from the website too
2016-03-29 10:04:52	gnarface	what version?
2016-03-29 10:04:58	vale42	1.9.6
2016-03-29 10:05:07	vale42	but already tried lot of other versions
2016-03-29 10:05:31	gnarface	maybe your distro is missing the right package?
2016-03-29 10:05:39	vale42	befor the last patch of wow last week everything works great its just since the last update
2016-03-29 10:05:46	gnarface	yea
2016-03-29 10:05:49	gnarface	i had the same issue
2016-03-29 10:05:57	gnarface	i remember i pasted you my list of gnutls packages
2016-03-29 10:06:05	vale42	yeah
2016-03-29 10:06:06	gnarface	were you able to find and install all of them?
2016-03-29 10:06:17	gnarface	 &dependencies
2016-03-29 10:06:21	vale42	i think so yes
2016-03-29 10:06:53	gnarface	well you could try it on a debian livecd image
2016-03-29 10:06:59	gnarface	for comparison
2016-03-29 10:07:10	gnarface	if it works, then you know you're still missing something on your install
2016-03-29 10:07:47	vale42	yes this would be an idea but i pay knwo since 4 years each month 10€ and after every patch i had some problems
2016-03-29 10:07:56	vale42	i know wow does not support linux
2016-03-29 10:08:08	vale42	but they also are not intrest in helping us
2016-03-29 10:08:20	gnarface	vale42: wow patches used to break wine all the time man, you've been lucky
2016-03-29 10:08:41	vale42	and i wont pay anymore for a game wich doesnt give a fuck about there linux players
2016-03-29 10:08:43	gnarface	vale42: also, sometimes playonlinux has its own bugs
2016-03-29 10:08:54		Smilex (~Smilex@178.19.194.209) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.3)
2016-03-29 10:09:02	vale42	i know but i already try it with normal wine
2016-03-29 10:09:12	gnarface	vale42: well i think you should try it on debian like i said too
2016-03-29 10:09:30	gnarface	vale42: probably the stderr output of the wine build you have might even have clues
2016-03-29 10:09:44	gnarface	vale42: you're likely missing a library still
2016-03-29 10:10:00	gnarface	something that used to be optional for wow i guess
2016-03-29 10:10:03	vale42	yeah maybe ... but atm i am too angry:D
2016-03-29 10:10:16	vale42	can you post again your list?
2016-03-29 10:10:24	vale42	from the gnutls packages?
2016-03-29 10:10:25	gnarface	vale, also, did you look at other fixes here? https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=32314

2016-03-29 10:11:47	vale42	thanks
2016-03-29 10:11:51	vale42	will try it again
2016-03-29 10:12:02	gnarface	vale42: i'm also using the 64-bit client.  that might matter
2016-03-29 10:12:37	gnarface	also, when i updated those gnutls libraries, there were other libraries debian pulled in updates for too
2016-03-29 10:12:44	gnarface	and one or two removals
2016-03-29 10:12:53	gnarface	(they looked like renames)

2016-03-29 10:17:35	gnarface	vale42: unless you meant new apt sources, which would be: apt-get update
2016-03-29 10:17:44	gnarface	(at least on a debian or the like)
2016-03-29 10:18:07	vale42	and than just try out or are there some symbolic links i have to set?
2016-03-29 10:18:30	gnarface	well the packages may be named differently on your distro
2016-03-29 10:18:42	gnarface	at least on debian, there is no symlinking necessary
2016-03-29 10:18:46	gnarface	it takes care of that for you
2016-03-29 10:20:15	vale42	okay i hope mint does this too:D
2016-03-29 10:20:50	dabblers-buffet	Hey everybody.
2016-03-29 10:20:56	gnarface	vale42: try this: apt-cache search ^libgnutls
2016-03-29 10:21:03	gnarface	yo dabblers-buffet
2016-03-29 10:21:23	dabblers-buffet	Hey gnarface.
2016-03-29 10:21:56	dabblers-buffet	gnarface: I wanted to ask but do you know any good websites that offer high quality 1080p intro clips?
2016-03-29 10:22:14	dabblers-buffet	I used thecliparchive.com, but most of them are 480P.
2016-03-29 10:23:05	dabblers-buffet	I nearly got everything done on my channel.
2016-03-29 10:23:25	dabblers-buffet	I just need an intro, I already got done with the channel description, banner, & avatar.
2016-03-29 10:24:27	vale42	years ago i used flixpress an i was very happy with the intro
2016-03-29 10:24:38	vale42	but nowerdays i make my intros by my own:D
2016-03-29 10:24:47	dabblers-buffet	As a guess, are you using blender?
2016-03-29 10:25:02	dabblers-buffet	I recently got a book from my library called "Blender for Dummies".
2016-03-29 10:25:16	gnarface	dabblers-buffet: sorry, i got nothing
2016-03-29 10:25:30	vale42	jop
2016-03-29 10:25:46	vale42	i use blender since a lot of years now:)
2016-03-29 10:25:47	dabblers-buffet	I'm looking for websites that have free high quality video clips.
2016-03-29 10:25:55	vale42	ahh okay free
2016-03-29 10:25:56	vale42	...
2016-03-29 10:25:57	gnarface	blender sounds like a good idea
2016-03-29 10:25:58	dabblers-buffet	Not ones that require you to pay.
2016-03-29 10:26:05	vale42	sorry
2016-03-29 10:26:09	vale42	i dont read the free:D
2016-03-29 10:26:22	dabblers-buffet	I also need a good video editor to start out with on Linux.
2016-03-29 10:26:28	dabblers-buffet	I already got GIMP & Audacity.

2016-03-29 10:26:37	dabblers-buffet	I'm just not familiar with Kdenlive that much.
2016-03-29 10:26:45	vale42	okay:D
2016-03-29 10:26:54	dabblers-buffet	Kdenlive was suggested before.
2016-03-29 10:27:02	vale42	kdenlive is very huge but there are a lot of other good programms
2016-03-29 10:27:14	dabblers-buffet	Are they as popular as kdenlive too?
2016-03-29 10:27:29	dabblers-buffet	I saw my brother using OpenShot
2016-03-29 10:27:39	vale42	openshot is very easy
2016-03-29 10:27:49	vale42	but it has not such huge options and effects
2016-03-29 10:27:55	vale42	but its good and stabel
2016-03-29 10:28:21	dabblers-buffet	Which is one that is kinda in the middle? GIMP was like that level, I got a hold of some of the effects & the Alpha Channel options.
2016-03-29 10:28:35	dabblers-buffet	One that is easyish to use but has a lot of effects?
2016-03-29 10:28:58	vale42	someone told me flowblade would be good but i never used it...
2016-03-29 10:29:11	dabblers-buffet	How is Avidemux?
2016-03-29 10:30:40	vale42	never used it...
2016-03-29 10:30:43	dabblers-buffet	Lightworks?
2016-03-29 10:31:17	dabblers-buffet	Pitivi?
2016-03-29 10:32:17	vale42	also never used
2016-03-29 10:32:38	vale42	could recommend kdenlive but like you said its bit triky
2016-03-29 10:34:32	dabblers-buffet	I could get used to it, but it'll take me a long time to learn it.
2016-03-29 10:34:36	dabblers-buffet	Especially with video tutorials.
2016-03-29 10:38:13	dabblers-buffet	How long did it take you to get used to Kdenlive?
2016-03-29 10:40:27	dabblers-buffet	A few days?

2016-03-30 12:36:18	gnarface	ok i got it, should i host it then?
2016-03-30 12:36:33	gnarface	oh, Arthur_D is hosting it
2016-03-30 12:37:37	BTRE	uh, should I add him?
2016-03-30 12:37:53	gnarface	yea, probably
2016-03-30 12:38:03	BTRE	what's his steam name?

2016-03-30 12:38:34	Marezz	gnarface, heya, hopefully in a day or two i will well enough to play :D

2016-03-30 12:49:56	gnarface	this is what sucks about civ5 across the ocean, steam keeps disconnecting us
2016-03-30 12:50:10	gnarface	maybe we should set this to play-by-email or something
2016-03-30 12:50:28	Arthur_D	heh
2016-03-30 12:50:35	Arthur_D	maybe you should host
2016-03-30 12:50:44	BTRE	Hasn't really happened to me before tbh. And I've played with euros and murrikans
2016-03-30 12:51:02	gnarface	i'm not sure it will matter who hosts if we use steam, what we might need really is a vpn
2016-03-30 12:51:20	Arthur_D	can you join again though?
2016-03-30 12:51:40	Arthur_D	or will it happen often you think?
2016-03-30 12:51:43	gnarface	it just told me YOU GUYS disconnected, and made me the host of my own copy of the game
2016-03-30 12:51:55	Arthur_D	yep I know the deal
2016-03-30 12:51:55	BTRE	We're still connected
2016-03-30 12:52:02	Arthur_D	you can reconnect to us
2016-03-30 12:52:20	Arthur_D	but you will lose one turn to the AI
2016-03-30 12:52:32	gnarface	yea, what if you change it to pitboss mode first though?
2016-03-30 12:52:38	gnarface	or have you guys already taken the turn without me?
2016-03-30 12:52:38	Arthur_D	oh
2016-03-30 12:52:55	Arthur_D	still waiting, not sure if I can change to pitboss now?

2016-03-30 12:53:53	gnarface	i'm not sure if you can actually change it during the game
2016-03-30 12:54:00	gnarface	it might just ignore the setting or something
2016-03-30 12:54:06	Arthur_D	yeah dunno
2016-03-30 12:54:17	Arthur_D	or maybe we'll have to turn
2016-03-30 12:54:22	Arthur_D	I turned it on
2016-03-30 12:54:38	Arthur_D	at least it happened early in the game
2016-03-30 12:54:52	Arthur_D	so we can still decide on another host
2016-03-30 12:55:04	gnarface	you'll have to re-invite me too
2016-03-30 12:55:36	Arthur_D	ok

2016-03-30 12:55:48	gnarface	steam is down for maintenance?!
2016-03-30 12:56:04	Arthur_D	yes ;/
2016-03-30 12:56:09	Arthur_D	I get the same
2016-03-30 12:56:09	gnarface	or it just sucks...
2016-03-30 12:56:16	Arthur_D	it's back
2016-03-30 12:56:22	gnarface	it was disconnected for you too? maybe its just bad timing on our part
2016-03-30 12:56:38	Arthur_D	could be
2016-03-30 12:56:40	gnarface	i accepted the invite but it just gave me an error
2016-03-30 12:56:44	gnarface	try again?
2016-03-30 12:56:45	BTRE	I'm just sitting back, waiting to see how this works out.
2016-03-30 12:56:47	Arthur_D	ok'
2016-03-30 12:56:57	BTRE	I've got cocktails galore, so I'm not too fussed.
2016-03-30 12:57:03	gnarface	BTRE: i still don't see you online yet
2016-03-30 12:57:12	gnarface	still an error, Arthur_D
2016-03-30 12:57:15	BTRE	I'm still in the game, though.
2016-03-30 12:57:17	Arthur_D	I think me and BTRE might have to turn
2016-03-30 12:57:38	gnarface	try it, its possible we would have had to join the game as a pitboss game though first

2016-03-30 12:58:17	Arthur_D	let's start a new one then
2016-03-30 12:58:19	gnarface	well try turning the pitboss option off, in case that's it
2016-03-30 12:58:25	gnarface	or, yea, we can just start over, sigh
2016-03-30 12:58:27	Arthur_D	ok
2016-03-30 12:58:39	Arthur_D	yes let's just do that now IMO
2016-03-30 12:58:54	gnarface	lets start it in pitboss mode maybe then if this happens again we won't have problems reconnecting?
2016-03-30 12:58:55	BTRE	I just sent an invite because why the hell not
2016-03-30 12:59:03	Arthur_D	gnarface: exactly
2016-03-30 12:59:21	gnarface	BTRE: i get the same error from yours
2016-03-30 12:59:34	Arthur_D	should I host again or you? I'd prefer if someone else does it actually
2016-03-30 12:59:54	gnarface	i don't mind hosting it
2016-03-30 13:00:26	Arthur_D	ok, abandoned the game
2016-03-30 13:01:33	gnarface	restarted my client, just to be sure
2016-03-30 13:02:18	Arthur_D	good idea

2016-03-30 13:03:36	gnarface	i'll send invites

2016-03-30 15:41:50	eskimorris	hey there. Hoping to use my Lenovo G50 to emulate gamecube games. does anyone know how to increase the available memory for an apu?
2016-03-30 15:48:19	fs0ciety	eskimorris, that is all in the bios
2016-03-30 15:48:29	fs0ciety	eskimorris, you can assign the amount of ram for the apu there
2016-03-30 15:49:39	eskimorris	i was worried that was the case. I've no experience with altering the bios, alas mine does not have the options stock. any suggestions on some reading material before attempting this?
2016-03-30 15:50:41	eskimorris	in other words. the option is not currently in my bios to increase/decrease. the apu does allow this by design however
2016-03-30 15:52:33	fs0ciety	eskimorris, yeah i was worried that because you are using a laptop the bios would be ridiculously locked down :(
2016-03-30 15:53:08	eskimorris	it is. it sucks. haha.
2016-03-30 15:53:21	eskimorris	any known solutions?

2016-04-06 16:34:51	calexil	its like this
2016-04-06 16:34:51		[16:34]
2016-04-06 16:34:58	calexil	the psu has two 12v rails
2016-04-06 16:35:03	calexil	both 8 pin
2016-04-06 16:35:16	calexil	the gpu takes two 6pins
2016-04-06 16:35:27	calexil	the cables that came with the psu
2016-04-06 16:35:40	calexil	go from 8pin to 6/8 pin
2016-04-06 16:35:49	calexil	and split into a second 6/8 pin
2016-04-06 16:35:59	calexil	the question is simple.
2016-04-06 16:36:06	gnarface	i followed you up until the end
2016-04-06 16:36:06	calexil	do I use two psu 12v rails
2016-04-06 16:36:10	calexil	with two cables
2016-04-06 16:36:18	calexil	or just one that splits
2016-04-06 16:36:30	calexil	the interwebs have no real answer
2016-04-06 16:36:50	gnarface	i've seen power supplised with two 8-pin connectors, where each 8-pin connector has the last two pins detachable, and you can unhook them to use the lines as two 6-pin ones
2016-04-06 16:36:58	calexil	yep
2016-04-06 16:37:02	calexil	thats what I got
2016-04-06 16:37:07	gnarface	ok then you're probably fine
2016-04-06 16:37:08	calexil	8>6/8
2016-04-06 16:37:24	calexil	I swapped to two cables and I see no noticeable difference
2016-04-06 16:37:26	gnarface	if you'd said 6/2 i'd have understood what you meant
2016-04-06 16:37:33	gnarface	but maybe i still don't
2016-04-06 16:37:45	calexil	okay so I should be fine with one cable
2016-04-06 16:37:57	calexil	like.. if it was wrong
2016-04-06 16:38:03	calexil	it wouldnt even post imho
2016-04-06 16:38:14	gnarface	oh wait
2016-04-06 16:38:21	gnarface	maybe now i get it
2016-04-06 16:38:30	gnarface	i think i'd go with two rails
2016-04-06 16:38:38	calexil	okay thats what im on now
2016-04-06 16:38:41	calexil	two cables
2016-04-06 16:38:46	gnarface	so as not to overload one rail
2016-04-06 16:38:51	calexil	each are 8>6/2
2016-04-06 16:39:04	calexil	split like this 8>6/s-6/2
2016-04-06 16:39:20	gnarface	i'd expect the two rails to last longer with lower load than one taking all the load

2016-04-07 06:59:32	mirv_	calexil, because so long as you've got amdgpu loaded up, it's ok
2016-04-07 06:59:46	mirv_	it's that rather than the kernel version that is needed
2016-04-07 07:00:35	calexil	do i need something besides amdgpu-pro installed
2016-04-07 07:00:38	calexil	like mesa or w/e
2016-04-07 07:00:52	calexil	im tryin to get this thing workin on mint 17.3
2016-04-07 07:00:58	calexil	I have access to kernel 4.4 and 4.2
2016-04-07 07:01:10	winter	iirc mesa still does userspace junk on top of amdgpu?
2016-04-07 07:01:18	winter	i don't own amd tho so i may be off base there
2016-04-07 07:01:29	@Samsai	doesn't the amdgpu-pro package load up amdgpu via DKMS or something like that?
2016-04-07 07:01:35	calexil	im just tryin to get the tearing under control
2016-04-07 07:01:37		kvm2k is now known as Kvm2k
2016-04-07 07:01:42	calexil	gamez work perfect as far as I tested
2016-04-07 07:01:46	@Samsai	AFAIK you don't need anything more than the amdgpu-pro package
2016-04-07 07:01:51	mirv_	Samsai, with ubuntu yes
2016-04-07 07:01:52	calexil	thats what I thought
2016-04-07 07:02:24	@Samsai	mirv_, well, ubuntu is the only linux distro so... :P
2016-04-07 07:02:26	winter	calexil: is overall performance > catalyst, or was that just in one isolated tf2 test i saw on phoronix or something?
2016-04-07 07:02:40	mirv_	Samsai, fair enough - gentoo is more than a distro, it's a calling
2016-04-07 07:02:56	calexil	no i benchmarked a r9 380x on a buncha tests
2016-04-07 07:03:01	calexil	it smashed fglrx
2016-04-07 07:03:04	winter	orly
2016-04-07 07:03:17	winter	blech, i just bought a 980ti too, heh

2016-04-07 07:03:26	mirv_	there's little that fglrx wins with these days
2016-04-07 07:03:42	mirv_	last I looked, UE4 was still in favour of fglrx though
2016-04-07 07:03:44	calexil	fglrx was working 'fine' on my r9 270
2016-04-07 07:03:49	calexil	but the card was choked
2016-04-07 07:03:55	mirv_	...btw, I don't actually use fglrx anymore
2016-04-07 07:04:01	calexil	me neither
2016-04-07 07:04:04	calexil	aparently
2016-04-07 07:04:10	@Samsai	mirv_, well, last i checked crimson technically won at almost everything
2016-04-07 07:04:21	@Samsai	there are instances where mesa beats it though
2016-04-07 07:04:29	winter	crimson?
2016-04-07 07:04:29	calexil	were talkin amdgpu-pro
2016-04-07 07:04:38	mirv_	Samsai, ah ok, never got to try crimson
2016-04-07 07:04:38	calexil	not amdgpu or radeonsi
2016-04-07 07:04:44	@Samsai	can't say anything about amdgpu-pro because i am on GCN 1.0
2016-04-07 07:04:49	winter	wat
2016-04-07 07:04:56	winter	why are there like half a dozen different AMD drivers now =\
2016-04-07 07:05:03	calexil	no fucking clue
2016-04-07 07:05:06	calexil	its so silly
2016-04-07 07:05:06	@Samsai	it's good that AMD's driver architecture is clear

2016-04-07 07:05:21	calexil	explanation

2016-04-07 07:05:58	@Samsai	i saw it only as fglrx strapped onto amdgpu
2016-04-07 07:06:01	winter	well then what is amdgpu-pro?
2016-04-07 07:06:06	winter	vs amdgpu?

2016-04-07 07:06:15	mirv_	Samsai, oh no, it's more than a simple rehash of fglrx
2016-04-07 07:06:18	calexil	its the hybrid stack
2016-04-07 07:06:21	hmb	ads removed
2016-04-07 07:06:25	calexil	with fglrx parts for opengl 4.5
2016-04-07 07:06:29	calexil	opencl 2.0
2016-04-07 07:06:33	calexil	and some shaders
2016-04-07 07:06:41	calexil	plus vulkan
2016-04-07 07:06:44	@Samsai	mirv_, since when?
2016-04-07 07:06:48	mirv_	they had to strip a lot of cruft out of fglrx

2016-04-07 07:07:44	calexil	they're at the bottom
2016-04-07 07:07:45	winter	that's a fucking stupid naming scheme
2016-04-07 07:07:48	@Samsai	it's basically fglrx in userspace
2016-04-07 07:07:58	@Samsai	amdgpu-pro name should really go
2016-04-07 07:08:10	mirv_	it's flgrx as it was meant to be, in userspace
2016-04-07 07:08:14	winter	guys! let's figure out how we can name these things in the most confusing way possibly
2016-04-07 07:08:26	winter	possible. ugh. i can grammar today, i swear.
2016-04-07 07:08:32	@Samsai	hopefully they'll sort it out eventually
2016-04-07 07:08:34	mirv_	lots of legacy code removed - they probably can't even load a GL1.2 context with it
2016-04-07 07:08:40	@Samsai	because the current naming scheme is just weird
2016-04-07 07:09:03	@Samsai	call it crimson next or something like that
2016-04-07 07:09:31	winter	so you can't use amdgpu-pro without amdgpu installed? or was that what calexil was saying, that he doesn't have amdgpu?
2016-04-07 07:09:38	winter	or does amdgpu-pro *include* the amdgpu kernel bits?
2016-04-07 07:09:54	@Samsai	amdgpu contains the amdgpu kernel module and install it if you don't have it
2016-04-07 07:09:57	mirv_	winter, the amdgpu-pro package includes amdgpu kernel modules
2016-04-07 07:10:11	mirv_	as in the install released by AMD does
2016-04-07 07:10:14	mirv_	*installer
2016-04-07 07:10:20	winter	okay, so amdgpu-pro implies amdgpu, but amdgpu doesn't imply amdgpu-pro
2016-04-07 07:10:25	@Samsai	yes
2016-04-07 07:10:28	winter	got it
2016-04-07 07:10:33	@Samsai	you can also run the open stack on top of amdgpu
2016-04-07 07:10:42	calexil	I just ran the installer
2016-04-07 07:10:42	mirv_	like I'm currently doing
2016-04-07 07:10:45	mirv_	(on this machine)
2016-04-07 07:10:46	calexil	i was on mesa 10.3
2016-04-07 07:10:49	calexil	or somethin
2016-04-07 07:10:54	calexil	i didnt have amdgpu
2016-04-07 07:10:54	winter	wait, what's the open stack? i thought that was amdgpu-pro?
2016-04-07 07:11:00	calexil	the installer installed it in my kernel
2016-04-07 07:11:02	@Samsai	winter, open stack is mesa
2016-04-07 07:11:05	winter	jfc
2016-04-07 07:11:14	@Samsai	amdgpu-pro is the closed stack on top of amdgpu
2016-04-07 07:11:19	mirv_	oh it gets better
2016-04-07 07:11:24	winter	okay, so you have: flgrx, crimson, amdgpu-pro, and amdgpu+mesa
2016-04-07 07:11:28	winter	am i missing anything?
2016-04-07 07:11:30	calexil	radeonsi
2016-04-07 07:11:32	mirv_	you can probably mix & match pieces
2016-04-07 07:11:32	@Samsai	winter, yes
2016-04-07 07:11:33	winter	lol
2016-04-07 07:11:34	calexil	r600
2016-04-07 07:11:42	calexil	fglrx-legacy
2016-04-07 07:11:45	calexil	yeah you missed a few
2016-04-07 07:11:48	mirv_	so I can almost run Vulkan from amdgpu-pro, but OpenGL from Mesa
2016-04-07 07:11:57	calexil	oh and the vulkan sdk
2016-04-07 07:11:57	winter	the fact that i missed "a few" and not just "one or two" is a cause for concern haha
2016-04-07 07:12:15	mirv_	just that their Vulkan library needs a custom libdrm
2016-04-07 07:12:32	winter	eh well, despite amdgpu-pro > flgrx, still kinda glad i went with the 980ti
2016-04-07 07:12:41	winter	maybe i'll revisit AMD again in 2 years when it's time to upgrade again
2016-04-07 07:13:12	calexil	fglrx, crimson, fglrx-legacy, amdgpu+mesa, amdgpu-pro(fglrx), radeonsi+mesa, r600+mesa, vulkan sdk
2016-04-07 07:13:13	mirv_	amdgpu-pro isn't available for all distros yet
2016-04-07 07:13:15	calexil	there you go
2016-04-07 07:13:15		[07:13]
2016-04-07 07:13:17	calexil	thats the list
2016-04-07 07:13:36	calexil	the installer only has debian debs in it
2016-04-07 07:13:39	@Samsai	vulkan sdk isn't a driver stack, right?
2016-04-07 07:13:41	mirv_	amdgpu-pro isn't even stable - it's a beta build aimed at Vulkan testing
2016-04-07 07:13:45	kkit_	winter: and as you unlock weapons, you have better chances of getting good guns as early drops
2016-04-07 07:13:46	calexil	and checks for release trusty currentl;y
2016-04-07 07:13:54	mirv_	Samsai, no
2016-04-07 07:13:56	calexil	fglrx, crimson, fglrx-legacy, amdgpu+mesa, amdgpu-pro(fglrx), radeonsi+mesa, r600+mesa
2016-04-07 07:13:59	calexil	there no vulkan
2016-04-07 07:14:00	calexil	w/e
2016-04-07 07:14:27	calexil	^^ that^^ is the real problem at AMD

2016-04-07 07:14:56	@Samsai	so that makes it a little bit better
2016-04-07 07:14:59	mirv_	well amdgpu is going to clean up a lot of problems for AMD under GNU/Linux
2016-04-07 07:15:01	calexil	hd6000 users do
2016-04-07 07:15:07	@Samsai	they think they do
2016-04-07 07:15:11	@Samsai	but they really don't
2016-04-07 07:15:23	calexil	amd abandonned them
2016-04-07 07:15:34	calexil	if you wanna game or mine on hd6000 you need fglrx legacy
2016-04-07 07:15:36	calexil	gtfo

2016-04-07 07:15:39	mirv_	hd6950 users who want to use OpenCL or GL4.3 (and above) want fglrx still
2016-04-07 07:16:18	calexil	tonight ima try to get this tearing under control in amdgpu-pro
2016-04-07 07:16:22	calexil	and run more benchmarks
2016-04-07 07:16:31	calexil	bioshock was runnin kinda crappy on ultru
2016-04-07 07:16:35	mirv_	I just want Vulkan to load up, but gotta wait still
2016-04-07 07:16:37	calexil	but medium and high were playable
2016-04-07 07:16:49	calexil	40-70 fps
2016-04-07 07:16:51	mirv_	bioshock probably still runs better with Mesa
2016-04-07 07:17:02	calexil	not a chance
2016-04-07 07:17:09	calexil	it was goin like 4-17 fps for me
2016-04-07 07:17:12	@Samsai	if my experiences are something to go by, no it doesn't
2016-04-07 07:17:27	@Samsai	bioshock gets bottlenecked really hard
2016-04-07 07:17:27	mirv_	I had 70fps at high with r600
2016-04-07 07:17:28	calexil	on 4.4 and xf86-ati
2016-04-07 07:17:43	mirv_	..depending what level, and where I looked
2016-04-07 07:17:53	calexil	r9 270 4.4kernel, xf86-ati aka radeonSI
2016-04-07 07:17:58	calexil	4-17 fps on high
2016-04-07 07:18:01	calexil	bleah
2016-04-07 07:18:07	calexil	gave up on radeonsi
2016-04-07 07:18:12	calexil	and gcn 1.0 for that matter
2016-04-07 07:18:52	mirv_	I truly gave up on fglrx when I started playing both talos principle and grid: autosport on a kaveri, using radeonsi
2016-04-07 07:19:22	mirv_	not super high settings mind you, but stable framerates and no crashes
2016-04-07 07:20:00	calexil	yeah
2016-04-07 07:20:06	calexil	I can play at medium
2016-04-07 07:20:10	calexil	30-45 fps
2016-04-07 07:20:14	calexil	notbad.jpg
2016-04-07 07:20:21	calexil	amdgpu-pro
2016-04-07 07:20:38	calexil	bout the same as fglrx but not as fucky
2016-04-07 07:21:02	calexil	when I say fglrx I usually mean crimson btw
2016-04-07 07:21:05	calexil	like
2016-04-07 07:21:08	calexil	basically always
2016-04-07 07:21:32	mirv_	fglrx is ok using "pure" GL3.3, or GL4.5
2016-04-07 07:21:44	mirv_	if you load a compat context though....ugh

2016-04-07 07:58:20	mekhami	anyone gotten stardew valley working on linux?
2016-04-07 07:58:29	Marezz	mirv_, i see, is there anything more budget than 380x that you would recommend?
2016-04-07 07:58:49	mirv_	for AMD? hmm....
2016-04-07 07:59:45	mekhami	i have tried to get stardew valley working manually with wine 1.9.4 also using playonlinux, nothing seems to work
2016-04-07 07:59:51	mekhami	i get the XNA framework error when i try to launch it
2016-04-07 07:59:55	Marezz	well amd, nvidia, doesnt matter :)
2016-04-07 08:00:24	mirv_	Marezz, you'll probably be better off gaming right now with just something cheap from nvidia
2016-04-07 08:00:38	mirv_	I suppose anything should be ok, but I don't know which is best value for money

2016-04-07 08:01:00	mirv_	however...if you get something very cheap now....
2016-04-07 08:01:12	mirv_	pretty sure the next gen AMD cards are due out this year
2016-04-07 08:01:22	mirv_	which should drive prices down on older cards
2016-04-07 08:02:09	mirv_	anything GCN 1.2 (the 380X is one of those) will have support for Vulkan (strictly speaking, right now)
2016-04-07 08:03:05	mirv_	not sure which architectures from nvidia are included in their vulkan support
2016-04-07 08:03:21	Ysblokje	goodnight
2016-04-07 08:04:07	mirv_	g'night
2016-04-07 08:04:24	gnarface	Marezz: its alright, i figured
2016-04-07 08:05:02	mirv_	Marezz, I also prefer open source drivers (for practical reasons actually), so nvidia isn't an option for me really
2016-04-07 08:05:18	mirv_	hence why I don't know what to recommend from them

2016-04-07 08:09:25	gnarface	Marezz: i still think you should wait till nvidia releases their next gpu line, then buy a clearance priced asus 980
2016-04-07 08:10:21	gnarface	Marezz: i know we have no idea when nvidia will release their next product line, but my instincts tell me they'd all kill themselves rather than miss releasing a new product line in time for christmas this year, with AMD Zen chips coming out around the same time
2016-04-07 08:10:57	gnarface	they know lots of gamers are gonna be buying whole new rigs then, because of new sockets and ddr speeds
2016-04-07 08:11:13	Smilex	stqn: has Nvidia gone up to the thousands yet?
2016-04-07 08:11:17	Smilex	ignoring the previous count
2016-04-07 08:11:25	stqn	Smilex: nope
2016-04-07 08:11:38	gnarface	what do the titan X cards count as?

2016-04-07 08:12:13	Marezz	gnarface, we dont have clearance's here, everything holds their price

2016-04-07 08:13:09	gnarface	:( well it might be the type of deal that requires international shipping to benefit from
2016-04-07 08:13:23	Marezz	and thats probably more than half a year worth of wait, im really down because im without a gpu for so long :(

2016-04-07 08:21:02	gnarface	Marezz: since its a turn-based game similar to civ5 in graphical complexity, i think there's a chance if the engine isn't worse it could run as well as civ for you on that intel card
2016-04-07 08:22:07	gnarface	Marezz: also this Crusader Kings one, which has about 1000 DLC packages available.  i wouldn't recommend buying any of it full-price

2016-04-07 08:24:34	gnarface	Marezz: there's this game FTL that definitely would run too, and its not like the others, but i find that it has a strong turn-based feel to the combat, similar to baldur's gate/icewind dale where the combat is realtime but feels almost turn based because it emphasizes frequent pausing during battle to give more orders

2016-04-07 09:38:08	karolherbst	yeah well, if you want to do a trustworthy survey, you have to specify 1. sample size 2. how you collected the data 3. the raw values collected (though the latter might be not so important as long as you know the questions and the abolsute values of the results)
2016-04-07 09:38:22	karolherbst	anything else is garbage
2016-04-07 09:38:48	gnarface	well but for example, i have no reason to believe this page is lying about the amount of "users" online if you assume they aren't distinguishing bots and zombie connections from real people: http://store.steampowered.com/stats/

2016-04-07 09:38:59	karolherbst	yeah, this is fine
2016-04-07 09:39:08	karolherbst	but it doesn't give us any information on the survey
2016-04-07 09:39:36	gnarface	well it gives us a ballpark for reference
2016-04-07 09:39:56	karolherbst	not really, because if the method is screwed every conclusion is screwed too
2016-04-07 09:40:05	gnarface	you couldn't expect precision below 1%, but i'd believe you could get within 10%
2016-04-07 09:40:23	karolherbst	10% is pretty heavy though
2016-04-07 09:40:48	karolherbst	that means linux usage could be between 0% and 10%
2016-04-07 09:40:58	gnarface	yea, in a "i'm taking a statistics class" sense, sure, but when your crazy windows zealot uncle tells you "bah, steam only has about 100 linux users" you know they're definitely wrong
2016-04-07 09:40:59	karolherbst	if the error is 10% in avarage
2016-04-07 09:41:10	stqn	yep I’ve been asking for the steam survey on wine a couple times
2016-04-07 09:41:19	stqn	asked*
2016-04-07 09:41:31	gnarface	well i always cancel it on wine now
2016-04-07 09:41:34	stqn	on linux too though (once or twice, don’t remember)
2016-04-07 09:41:37	karolherbst	having 1% in a catagory with 1% avarage errors means, the value can be 2%
2016-04-07 09:41:37	gnarface	but i think i've only ever gotten it ONCE on linux
2016-04-07 09:41:44	karolherbst	this is a difference of 100% which is really havy
2016-04-07 09:42:00	stqn	I think steam tends to show the survey when the hardware or software changed
2016-04-07 09:42:17	karolherbst	I think to have a valid value of 1% you need a failure rate far below 0.1%
2016-04-07 09:42:30	karolherbst	*error
2016-04-07 09:42:53	gnarface	interesting, civ5 is still in the top 5 most played games
2016-04-07 09:43:16	Smilex	Another way to do it is to increase the price

2016-04-07 09:43:37	karolherbst	gnarface: you have to think about this way: if you asked 100.000 users and by accidence 99.000 of them are widnows user, but you have a linux base of 4%
2016-04-07 09:43:41	Smilex	personally I want game prices to go way up, so I'd appreciate it, but I get why other won't
2016-04-07 09:43:43	karolherbst	you still have a really small error rate
2016-04-07 09:44:02	Smilex	that's another way to make Linux worth it
2016-04-07 09:44:21	karolherbst	and this is the way this survey has to be treated, because this is completly insane to trust it at all, not even a tiny bit
2016-04-07 09:45:10	Smilex	karolherbst: well you can trust that the Linux total user count is still a tiny bit compared to Windows
2016-04-07 09:45:16	Smilex	no matter the error percent
2016-04-07 09:45:19	karolherbst	yeah, that's right for sure
2016-04-07 09:45:29	gnarface	karolherbst: i think that's a little extreme, i still maintain its likely to be ballpark-relevant, if you assume bots are people
2016-04-07 09:45:42	karolherbst	yeah I know it won't matter in the end
2016-04-07 09:45:49	karolherbst	but they should still be transparent about it
2016-04-07 09:45:58	karolherbst	at least as a publisher I would expect them to be
2016-04-07 09:46:17	gnarface	they could, but i also still maintain it seems more likely that any lack of transparency is hiding linux users numbers rather than inflating them
2016-04-07 09:46:19	karolherbst	I wouldn't work with untrusted data if it comes to company gross
2016-04-07 09:46:26	karolherbst	well they still do
2016-04-07 09:46:28	karolherbst	but still

2016-04-07 09:53:46	gnarface	i think strategically its smartest for Valve if none of their partners see their linux user base as anything other than a laughable non-threat
2016-04-07 09:53:46		[09:53]
2016-04-07 09:54:30	gnarface	to that end, i think we can expect their linux user figures to remain at "1%" for the foreseeable future
2016-04-07 09:54:49	karolherbst	I don't get why they should feel threatened
2016-04-07 09:54:56	karolherbst	it measn more money in the end, doesn't it?
2016-04-07 09:55:01	karolherbst	well
2016-04-07 09:55:07	karolherbst	at least a chance of more money
2016-04-07 09:55:20	gnarface	when steamos really takes off and stealth reaches some absurd number like 25% of all users, then they'll probably "fix" the statistics reporting and drop the mic
2016-04-07 09:55:32	karolherbst	:D
2016-04-07 09:55:41	karolherbst	they really can't do that
2016-04-07 09:55:55	karolherbst	I am sure they have to provide at least some publishers with right data based on contracts or something else
2016-04-07 09:56:07	gnarface	hmm. mabye? i don't know
2016-04-07 09:56:14	karolherbst	also
2016-04-07 09:56:18	karolherbst	publisher would might get pissed
2016-04-07 09:56:28	karolherbst	because that means like 20% money they didn't get
2016-04-07 09:56:32	karolherbst	at least they would say it
2016-04-07 09:56:49	gnarface	i'm not sure what types of commitments they'd have, but my theory is based largely on the assumption that the inaccuracies in the reporting *is* to hide the real data from the publishers
2016-04-07 09:57:08	karolherbst	well in the end they get the os number from the sales, don't they?
2016-04-07 09:57:36	gnarface	some data does come from sales
2016-04-07 09:57:38	karolherbst	so if you launch with day 1 linux support, you should get them
2016-04-07 09:57:52	gnarface	i'm not sure how clear they are on how they correlate sales with steam surveys
2016-04-07 09:58:02	karolherbst	mhhh
2016-04-07 09:58:05	karolherbst	well
2016-04-07 09:58:29	karolherbst	this means that the linux numbers would stay low as long as there aren't many linux games
2016-04-07 09:58:31	gnarface	but i did hear that its not the sales exactly as where the game is played; so if you buy a steamplay game on linux, but then end up playing it mostly on windows in the first 2 weeks, it'll count as a windows sale anyway, at least that's what i've heard said
2016-04-07 09:58:49	karolherbst	ahh yeah right
2016-04-07 09:58:55	karolherbst	well I only play on linux nowadays
2016-04-07 09:58:59	karolherbst	even if its wine
2016-04-07 09:59:03	karolherbst	they know it anyway
2016-04-07 09:59:10	gnarface	me too, but its a good cautionary tale against "trying it in windows to compare"
2016-04-07 09:59:16	karolherbst	because the string "wine" appears in the sent data
2016-04-07 09:59:31	karolherbst	ohhhh
2016-04-07 09:59:35	karolherbst	do you know what would be funny?
2016-04-07 09:59:41	gnarface	also i'm not sure how they count wine.  they don't say whether they count that as windows or linux users.  they clearly should have sufficient data to do either, but they don't admit which
2016-04-07 09:59:45	karolherbst	if wine would report an own Windows version
2016-04-07 09:59:55	gnarface	lol windows 11
2016-04-07 10:00:04	gnarface	windows 94?
2016-04-07 10:00:16	gnarface	i like it
2016-04-07 10:00:17	karolherbst	yeah or just make itso, that the steam survey would say: OS Wine
2016-04-07 10:00:45	karolherbst	then I would also be happy to send the survey out through wine
2016-04-07 10:01:35	gnarface	i'm certain valve *could* fairly accurately distinguish wine from windows most the time, but i have a sneaky suspicion they blithely count those as windows installs
2016-04-07 10:01:45	karolherbst	yeah
2016-04-07 10:01:47	karolherbst	but they know
2016-04-07 10:02:09	karolherbst	and do you know why they know?
2016-04-07 10:02:14	gnarface	they know for sure; some people have run afoul of the VAC system
2016-04-07 10:02:16	stqn	IIRC wine shows up as wine in the survey
2016-04-07 10:02:30	karolherbst	because they are friggin supporting it
2016-04-07 10:02:34	Smilex	I think the future of Linux rests in the hands of karolherbst and his work on the Mesa project. So I hope you won't let us all down.

2016-04-07 11:26:53	karolherbst	usually you don't make a conf file

2016-04-07 11:31:53	calexil	therin lies the problem
2016-04-07 11:32:11	calexil	dri3 is not loading
2016-04-07 11:32:19	karolherbst	it is
2016-04-07 11:32:31	karolherbst	"AMDGPU(0): DRI3 enabled"
2016-04-07 11:32:35	calexil	fuck
2016-04-07 11:32:42	calexil	why is it tearing like crazy then
2016-04-07 11:32:44	calexil	i am so lost
2016-04-07 11:32:54	karolherbst	well maybe you have a problem with dri3, this also happens sometimes
2016-04-07 11:33:15	karolherbst	Option "DRI3" "0"
2016-04-07 11:33:23	karolherbst	add this to your xorg.conf device
2016-04-07 11:33:29	karolherbst	maybe this helps?
2016-04-07 11:33:36	calexil	the one in corg.conf.d
2016-04-07 11:33:38	karolherbst	could be that something is odd with the amdgpu kernel driver
2016-04-07 11:33:40	karolherbst	yeah
2016-04-07 11:34:07	karolherbst	and maybe change "DRI" "3" to "2"

2016-04-07 11:51:49	stqn	looks like it’s an AMD thing, compton worked with the intel driver for me and then on nvidia
2016-04-07 11:52:14	karolherbst	I know that kwin works for sure
2016-04-07 11:52:30	karolherbst	I even have no tearing when I set vsync to never
2016-04-07 11:53:08	karolherbst	well I also use the EGL backend, it seems like on GLX it still tears when set ot never

2016-04-08 00:56:30	@Samsai	consistency is the key
2016-04-08 00:58:27	matthias2	basically dependancy is a mess with no real solution...
2016-04-08 00:58:27		[00:58]
2016-04-08 00:58:56	matthias2	at the end the best solution is to use a few dependancy as you can, when you code
2016-04-08 00:59:37	Smilex	that's been my response
2016-04-08 00:59:37	DerRidda	If it wasn't for gem, pip, nuget or npm the development experience with these languages would be considerably worse.
2016-04-08 00:59:44	Smilex	DerRidda: no
2016-04-08 01:00:17	Smilex	For example. I've been able to do much more and been much happier with JS now that I absolutely do not use jquery or bootstrap or whatever the fuck
2016-04-08 01:00:21	matthias2	Dezponia: yes but for the user expenrience would be better
2016-04-08 01:00:41	Smilex	what I'm currently working on is removing a dependency from an app I made, and everything was doing very well
2016-04-08 01:01:11	DerRidda	I say package manager you start talking about dependencies.
2016-04-08 01:01:13	matthias2	when you use dependancy that are not package everywhere, you need to distribute the dependancy with your app
2016-04-08 01:01:58	DerRidda	Of course you should keep dependencies flat but when you need them, these package managers help a lot with getting them and keeping them updated.
2016-04-08 01:02:09	Smilex	oh yeah I thought that was assumed. Instead of package managers, everyone just have a copy with their project
2016-04-08 01:02:16	Smilex	it's a waste, but a response
2016-04-08 01:03:16	DerRidda	Sure, for deployment I actually agree but while developing those package managers help a lot.

2016-04-08 01:06:31	gnarface	wow, 64-bit starcraft2 single player actually runs pretty fast these days
2016-04-08 01:06:40	gnarface	multiplayer still a laggy mess
2016-04-08 01:06:46	matthias2	DerRidda: if you can asure that every devploper use the same environement at the same version yes, but when you try to made your program avable for devloper from any distro you will certainelly give other dev a big headache
2016-04-08 01:07:37	Smilex	so the issue was that Ubuntu provides a too old version of NPM, yet NPM still tried to download packages that clearly require a newer version
2016-04-08 01:07:49	Smilex	gnarface: Ah damn. The multiplayer is key

2016-04-08 05:06:01	Yamagata	I don't do it to feel better about myself or know that I know how to make wine work really well. I configure crap in wine because I have no alternative. If someone does the work to provide it for me, I consider that to be worth something.

2016-04-08 11:06:21	Smilex	gnarface: makes sense. But this time you ask a bit late for Europeans
2016-04-08 11:06:40	gnarface	yea, i know i was just hoping for some insomniacs
2016-04-08 11:06:55	homerj	I haven't played Civ5 in ages

2016-04-08 11:07:30	gnarface	but civ5 is an easy go-to since the latency for example would make having fun nearly impossible if any of you were to join my quake3 server or my team fortress server
2016-04-08 11:08:26	gnarface	homerj: you wanna play some?   you know the drill, i come in here and give anyone still awake and bored a chance to entertain me before i just give up to go play nintendo

2016-04-08 19:44:07	EddDeDuck	I just know if you max it out we’ve seen some hangs (although the last major check was ~4/6 weeks ago now)
2016-04-08 19:44:16	@Samsai	karolherbst, so this issue you found means that 4.5 kernels don't work anyway?
2016-04-08 19:44:46	karolherbst	Samsai: no, you would need to compile nouveau from my branch, but I think I left a locking issue somewhere
2016-04-08 19:44:53	liothe	how frequent were the hangs? ran 3-4 campaign missions last time without issue (except the floor)
2016-04-08 19:45:13	karolherbst	because nouveau checks every second if it has to reclock due to changed temperature and when the user triggers a reclock at the same time, it might deadlock? not sure though
2016-04-08 19:45:41	EddDeDuck	The hangs were only seen when pushing the highest settings
2016-04-08 19:45:41	@Samsai	karolherbst, okay, i will set things up on monday for some stress testing
2016-04-08 19:45:42	liothe	at max settings I might add

2016-04-08 21:49:58	kon14	Spl-it: i dont use the function keys myself but does 95 translate to F11 or sth? iirc it should word with Mod+F11? also do you have an Fn lock key?
2016-04-08 21:49:58		[21:49]
2016-04-08 21:50:10	Spl-it	Ill try
2016-04-08 21:50:28	Spl-it	no resul
2016-04-08 21:50:30	Spl-it	t
2016-04-08 21:50:31	kon14	also those fn keys most probably have an icon for volup/dn?
2016-04-08 21:50:45	Spl-it	yeah FN keys dont work I think
2016-04-08 21:51:09	kon14	you could go with Mod+XF8AudioLowerVolume
2016-04-08 21:51:12	kon14	for instance
2016-04-08 21:51:17	Smilex	matthias2: the Machine Interface as they call it
2016-04-08 21:51:25	kon14	if x can identify those keys
2016-04-08 21:51:25	Spl-it	bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume $sink -- +10% doesnt do anything
2016-04-08 21:51:43	Spl-it	I need to use the FN key for th audio functions
2016-04-08 21:52:10	Smilex	Of course this "machine interface" sends and expects human readable text that needs to get parsed for the machine to even begin understand it
2016-04-08 21:52:20	kon14	if you press the fn lock before or together with the bound keys does it work?
2016-04-08 21:52:23	Smilex	but that's just the start of the fucking moronic result
2016-04-08 21:53:06	kon14	if there's an fn lock key (laptop?) you could just disable it altogether as well, unless you want it that is
2016-04-08 21:53:21	matthias2	Smilex: humm maybe, I've only use GDB in CLI
2016-04-08 21:53:40	Spl-it	kon14, no effect either, I need the FN key to control the led brightness on the keyboard
2016-04-08 21:53:42	Smilex	matthias2: yeah that's the part everyone uses, so it's at least usable
2016-04-08 21:54:07	Smilex	matthias2: The GDB/MI doesn't even follow its own rules
2016-04-08 21:54:07	Spl-it	coolermast ultimate quickfire keyboard
2016-04-08 21:54:52	Spl-it	it's annoying, I did get gamma controls to work the same way ish tho
2016-04-08 21:54:54	kon14	Spl-it: there's no function lock key on it as far as i can tell
2016-04-08 21:55:02	matthias2	Smilex: Yeah, I need to admit, I've never been able to use GDB in any IDE, just in CLI, or the emacs integration is not too bad
2016-04-08 21:55:06	Spl-it	there is, bottom right, next to ctrl
2016-04-08 21:55:26	kon14	oh
2016-04-08 21:55:31	matthias2	but I don't really use IDE a lot, so I may not have a really good experance with gdb integration
2016-04-08 21:55:32	kon14	never seen that placed there
2016-04-08 21:58:34	kon14	Spl-it: I think xev should help you find out which key is pressed according to X when you press those volume keys
2016-04-08 21:59:27	Spl-it	kon14, hmm.. without the FN lock they register as F10 / F11 etc, so it should work, I'll try
2016-04-08 22:00:28	Smilex	matthias2: my plan is to try and depend as little on GDB as possible
2016-04-08 22:00:53	Smilex	that will of course make sync issues likely
2016-04-08 22:01:05	Spl-it	kon14, xev shows me code 123 when I use fn+volume up.  Tried to bind it, no effect
2016-04-08 22:01:07	kon14	Spl-it: use this and press the volume keys, it's probably just a matter of finding out whatever the heck x thinks you're pressing
2016-04-08 22:01:10	kon14	xev | awk -F'[ )]+' '/^KeyPress/ { a[NR+2] } NR in a { printf "%-3s %s\n", $5, $8 }'

2016-04-08 22:02:45	kon14	if you use the command I posted above and press a key you'll get the int name and the x11 charset name or whatever its called
2016-04-08 22:03:21	Spl-it	kon14, that command somehow doesn't work for me
2016-04-08 22:03:54	kon14	Spl-it: did you install xev?
2016-04-08 22:03:59	kon14	whats the output?
2016-04-08 22:04:10	matthias2	Smilex: What are you working on ? a debuger integration to an IDE ?
2016-04-08 22:04:29	Smilex	matthias2: just a GDB frontend, not dependent on any IDE
2016-04-08 22:04:47	Smilex	because I hate IDEs, I just use vim and a terminal for running build

2016-04-08 22:06:03	matthias2	yeah, I do mostelly the same with emacs<---(This wa hard to write without a vim troll)
2016-04-08 22:06:24	Smilex	I tried emacs for a couple of months
2016-04-08 22:06:25	matthias2	but there is alerady CGDB and the curses mode in gdb with ctrl X a
2016-04-08 22:06:33	Smilex	not much difference
2016-04-08 22:06:56	matthias2	yes, but when you have the habits to the emacs/vim shortcut it's really hard to switch
2016-04-08 22:07:18	Smilex	Yeah but I like change
2016-04-08 22:07:19	kon14	Spl-it: if you need the int code for a key (you don't most likely)  you could also take a look here: /usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/xfree86
2016-04-08 22:07:39	Smilex	doesn't matter really. Turns out I like Vim a slight bit more, so I use it
2016-04-08 22:07:55	Smilex	matthias2: CGDB doesn't do what I want to do

2016-04-08 22:10:23	matthias2	actually the  main problem I have with GDB, in CLI is that it's really hard to debug curses with it

2016-04-08 22:11:53	matthias2	XD
2016-04-08 22:12:30	Smilex	I wonder if I'd do better if I just moved over to LLDB, does anyone know anything about that?

2016-04-08 22:13:52	Spl-it	kon14, yeah it gives me that
2016-04-08 22:14:11	kon14	oh you mean the file?
2016-04-08 22:14:43	Spl-it	yeah
2016-04-08 22:14:56	Spl-it	however the mod key + F10 or F11 is fine for me too
2016-04-08 22:15:11	Spl-it	silly thing is, the command works in the terminal, not in the config of i3wm
2016-04-08 22:15:45	kon14	Spl-it, I still think the issue lies within the way your keypresses are identified
2016-04-08 22:16:01	Spl-it	the gamma control with mod+F2 for example: bindcode $mod+68 exec xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --gamma 0.7:0.7:0.7  works just fine

2016-04-08 22:19:10	kon14	Spl-it: so what was the output of the xev command for F11/VOLUP?
2016-04-08 22:19:34	kon14	you should it didn't work, never mentioned the output
2016-04-08 22:20:13	kon14	that would be said*

2016-04-08 22:20:39		[22:20]
2016-04-08 22:21:00	matthias2	Smilex: but in this case you need to understand the gdb code
2016-04-08 22:21:28	Spl-it	and with FN key pressed it generates keycode 123
2016-04-08 22:22:13	Smilex	matthias2: yeah well nothing is easy
2016-04-08 22:22:14	kon14	and you're certain there's no typo in that config file? :P
2016-04-08 22:22:31	Spl-it	yeah copied the working command from the terminal with middle mouse :p
2016-04-08 22:23:03	kon14	so the command itself is working when used manually
2016-04-08 22:23:12	Spl-it	yep
2016-04-08 22:23:14	kon14	and the bindsym works for Mod+F2

2016-04-09 06:03:47	Fenix2412	today at work I was applying updates
2016-04-09 06:03:53	Fenix2412	on fresh installed win 7
2016-04-09 06:04:02	Fenix2412	had to do it from packages because updater had problems
2016-04-09 06:04:05	Fenix2412	to dl updates xD
2016-04-09 06:04:12	Spl-it	haha :P
2016-04-09 06:04:16	Fenix2412	so I dled "SUR" which was 500 MB bundle of updates
2016-04-09 06:04:21	Fenix2412	and guess what?
2016-04-09 06:04:32	Fenix2412	it took at least 15 minutes for windows
2016-04-09 06:04:38	Spl-it	my guess is blue screen and reinstall
2016-04-09 06:04:43	Fenix2412	to parse that 500 MB to just know what it's going to install
2016-04-09 06:04:49	Spl-it	haha :D
2016-04-09 06:04:57	Fenix2412	and then next 15 mins into the update
2016-04-09 06:05:06	Fenix2412	after 15 mins I had to leave and head home
2016-04-09 06:05:06	Fenix2412	xD
2016-04-09 06:06:17	Fenix2412	Spl-it, and there will be still another 500 MBs of updates left
2016-04-09 06:06:21	@Samsai	Fenix2412, you should have just sneakily installed ubuntu on them, that would have been 30 minutes to install and fully update :P

2016-04-09 06:06:32	Fenix2412	Samsai, there was ubuntu on it by default
2016-04-09 06:06:52	@Samsai	and they still decided to install time waster OS 7?

2016-04-09 06:20:21	karolherbst	stochastix: the xbox 360 is the recent one I guesS?
2016-04-09 06:20:33	karolherbst	I think I ahve the one before and there is the xpad kernel driver and xboxdrv userspace one
2016-04-09 06:21:02	Fenix2412	karolherbst, if you missed something xbox one is the recent M$ console
2016-04-09 06:21:03	Fenix2412	:p
2016-04-09 06:21:18	karolherbst	:D

2016-04-09 06:21:22	Fenix2412	and should work better
2016-04-09 06:21:23	karolherbst	yeah I meant the controller
2016-04-09 06:21:27	Fenix2412	than newer one
2016-04-09 06:21:27	karolherbst	:p
2016-04-09 06:22:06	karolherbst	yeah maybe the xbox 360 is really good supported
2016-04-09 06:22:12	karolherbst	I think there is nothing which doesn't work
2016-04-09 06:22:28	karolherbst	well sometimes games mess up the axis because they target xboxdrv...
2016-04-09 06:22:47	karolherbst	and some axis are mapped differently in xboxdr and xpa
2016-04-09 06:22:48	karolherbst	d

2016-04-09 06:34:17	@NaughtySquid	i dont agree at all
2016-04-09 06:34:18	Fenix2412	my friend is a heretic
2016-04-09 06:34:19	mirv_	for a good, solid shooter, I always enjoyed Quake4
2016-04-09 06:34:20	karolherbst	NaughtySquid: because the enemies spawn at set locations
2016-04-09 06:34:33	@Samsai	however, considering how well TW2 worked at launch the bioshock port was quite good
2016-04-09 06:34:33	@NaughtySquid	karolherbst: that does not make it a puzzle game
2016-04-09 06:34:44	karolherbst	right, but it doesn't feel like a real fps though
2016-04-09 06:34:45	@NaughtySquid	90% of FPS games the enemies come from set locations
2016-04-09 06:35:01	karolherbst	but most of the time you can't rely on that
2016-04-09 06:35:04	karolherbst	well in good ones you can't
2016-04-09 06:35:06	karolherbst	...
2016-04-09 06:35:09	@NaughtySquid	spawning points does not make a game a puzzle game
2016-04-09 06:35:21	@NaughtySquid	there's nothing to solve
2016-04-09 06:35:26	@NaughtySquid	it's all about your aim and timing
2016-04-09 06:35:31	FutureSuture	If we're all still here in 5 years, chatting away, does that make us friends?
2016-04-09 06:35:33	@NaughtySquid	it's an FPS to its very core
2016-04-09 06:35:40	stochastix	Just watched a superhot trailer
2016-04-09 06:35:42	stochastix	looks neat
2016-04-09 06:35:48	@Samsai	it's quite cool
2016-04-09 06:35:52	@Samsai	a bit too short though
2016-04-09 06:35:53	@NaughtySquid	its very cool
2016-04-09 06:35:57	@NaughtySquid	far too short indeed
2016-04-09 06:36:03	@NaughtySquid	linux is missing a major feature too for it
2016-04-09 06:36:04	@NaughtySquid	:(]
2016-04-09 06:36:10	stochastix	Looks like all the good games are going to be on steam
2016-04-09 06:36:19	karolherbst	NaughtySquid:
2016-04-09 06:36:20	Spl-it	wait a minute.. superhot is really cool ?  my brain can't handle this shit
2016-04-09 06:36:22	karolherbst	NaughtySquid: whatsmissing?
2016-04-09 06:36:25	karolherbst	it ran fine for me
2016-04-09 06:36:31	@NaughtySquid	their killcam feature thing
2016-04-09 06:36:34	@NaughtySquid	totally missing on linux
2016-04-09 06:36:36	karolherbst	ahh
2016-04-09 06:36:47	calexil	so no one here has a gcn 1.2 card runnin amdgpu pro?
2016-04-09 06:36:59	Spl-it	not me soz
2016-04-09 06:37:29	Spl-it	which cards are gcn 1.2 ?
2016-04-09 06:37:43	Spl-it	R9 3xxx ?
2016-04-09 06:39:19	Spl-it	btw this recent cortana nonsense, it will be everywhere.. friggin skynet I tell ye

2016-04-09 06:39:53	@Samsai	cause we are hip
2016-04-09 06:41:39	stochastix	Is it worth buying a steam box, or just build your own?
2016-04-09 06:42:07	@Samsai	stochastix, you get more bang for your buck if you build your own
2016-04-09 06:42:19	@Samsai	no different from pre-build PCs really
2016-04-09 06:42:41		Yamagata (~Yamagata@lightwells03.l.subnet.rcn.com) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-04-09 06:42:42	stochastix	Yea, I figured as much.
2016-04-09 06:42:53	stqn	stochastix: you can maybe get a smaller box if you buy one prebuilt, but apart from that…
2016-04-09 06:43:00	stochastix	guessing you can buikd the equivelent for like $400?
2016-04-09 06:43:10	karolherbst	and you can spend more money on the gpu and get a fast one :D
2016-04-09 06:43:25	stqn	opengl needs a fast cpu though
2016-04-09 06:43:40	stqn	ah well I see what you mean
2016-04-09 06:43:49	@Samsai	especially one with good single-threaded performance
2016-04-09 06:43:49		[06:43]
2016-04-09 06:43:58	karolherbst	usually opengl doesn't need a fast cpu
2016-04-09 06:44:02	karolherbst	a slow one is bad
2016-04-09 06:44:11	stochastix	seems many steam boxes hav an i7 inthem
2016-04-09 06:44:14	karolherbst	but a fast one... well if the engine is crap, then yeah, you need a fast cpu
2016-04-09 06:44:19	stqn	yeah 2D games don’t need a fast cpu :p
2016-04-09 06:44:29	@Samsai	karolherbst, well, unity
2016-04-09 06:44:45	stqn	karolherbst: dying light needs a fast cpu, euro truck simulator 2 too, for example
2016-04-09 06:44:53	karolherbst	yeah, but not beacuse they use opengl
2016-04-09 06:45:00	@Samsai	that's true
2016-04-09 06:45:11	@Samsai	it's mainly because the engine isn't optimized
2016-04-09 06:45:13	karolherbst	well i can't figure out why truck simulator needs a fast cpu...
2016-04-09 06:45:13	stqn	well DL is multithreaded yes, ETS2 not so much
2016-04-09 06:45:29	stqn	(or was, last time I played it)
2016-04-09 06:45:32	@Samsai	but it's not like we will get significantly better ports anytime soon, unless vulkan really takes off
2016-04-09 06:45:38	stochastix	any good free games on steam, or do most of them cost something?
2016-04-09 06:45:44	karolherbst	vulkan seems to be faster on linxu than on windows :D
2016-04-09 06:45:58	karolherbst	at least talos principle is with vulkan
2016-04-09 06:46:04	@NaughtySquid	in regards to that phoronix benchmark
2016-04-09 06:46:06	@Samsai	karolherbst, maybe we are finally seeing the overhead difference or something
2016-04-09 06:46:14	@NaughtySquid	Something I think Phoronix isn't aware of here. Talos Principle uses a low OpenGL version, so it likely doesn't have graphical features that the Dx11 Windows version does, which is likely the reason OpenGL does better.
2016-04-09 06:46:24	karolherbst	windows sucks at threading big times anyway
2016-04-09 06:46:29	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, vulkan benchmarks
2016-04-09 06:46:31	@Samsai	vulkan
2016-04-09 06:46:37	karolherbst	exactly
2016-04-09 06:46:37	@NaughtySquid	yeah i know
2016-04-09 06:46:42	@NaughtySquid	but he does opengl too in the same article
2016-04-09 06:46:44	@Samsai	it's vulkan vs vulkan
2016-04-09 06:46:54	karolherbst	yeah
2016-04-09 06:46:54	turol	karolherbst, Samsai: i'd agree it's probably the linux/windows kernel overhead
2016-04-09 06:47:01	karolherbst	but the vulkan benchmark shows a bigger difference
2016-04-09 06:47:02	turol	linux has been micro-optimised better
2016-04-09 06:47:10	karolherbst	the opengl difference is kind of "meh" like
2016-04-09 06:47:15	@NaughtySquid	the Vulkan difference is quite amazing though
2016-04-09 06:47:19	karolherbst	yeh
2016-04-09 06:47:36	karolherbst	I think Linux will show better vulkan perf in general
2016-04-09 06:47:43	karolherbst	because threading is much easier in vulkan
2016-04-09 06:47:50	karolherbst	and linux is so much better in threading than windows
2016-04-09 06:47:54	@Samsai	if it truly is the overhead difference then that would technically show valve was right when they published their opengl numbers way back when
2016-04-09 06:48:08	karolherbst	of course they are
2016-04-09 06:48:14	karolherbst	I doubt anybody ever said someting else
2016-04-09 06:48:19	karolherbst	the radeon binary driver is just shit
2016-04-09 06:48:30	karolherbst	and the mesa stuff isn't as optimized as nvidia anyway
2016-04-09 06:49:09	karolherbst	in the end it is always kernel overhead which kills performance as the very last reasons if everything else is optimized to the very end in uerspace
2016-04-09 06:50:02	karolherbst	and if windows would have a good kernel performance, google and facebook would have used windows instead, but they don't because they know that with linux they can lower their power consumption noticeably
2016-04-09 06:51:04	turol	google and facebook use linux because they can customize it easily
2016-04-09 06:51:23	karolherbst	to get better performance/power consumption
2016-04-09 06:51:26	@Samsai	also the deployments are basically free, you just need someone to deploy and maintain
2016-04-09 06:51:41	@Samsai	windows server screwed itself badly with the insane licensing
2016-04-09 06:51:48	karolherbst	yeah right, but if windows would excell alrady, they could save money too
2016-04-09 06:51:55	karolherbst	yeah true too
2016-04-09 06:52:01	turol	karolherbst: you could theoretically do that with windows too
2016-04-09 06:52:11	karolherbst	well...
2016-04-09 06:52:16	turol	only getting permission is so diffiicult and costs so much no-one bothers
2016-04-09 06:52:16	karolherbst	how so?
2016-04-09 06:52:23	karolherbst	right
2016-04-09 06:52:27	turol	if you had equivalent source access
2016-04-09 06:52:42	turol	which you can't get unless you're us government or have more money that god
2016-04-09 06:52:49	karolherbst	right
2016-04-09 06:52:57	karolherbst	so in the end it breaks down to cost/profit thing
2016-04-09 06:53:22	karolherbst	and so facebook/google decides they will make more money while using linux
2016-04-09 06:53:36	karolherbst	or other big companies with a massive amount of servers

2016-04-09 08:41:10	calexil	yep
2016-04-09 08:41:19	calexil	is there a kernel development ppa
2016-04-09 08:41:56	karolherbst	you could try out this, and maybe some Xorg ppa with recent software

2016-04-09 08:46:19	mirv_	that I don't know, it's much easier with gentoo
2016-04-09 08:46:39	mirv_	(seriously, getting all that setup & running is actually easier with gentoo)
2016-04-09 08:48:37	mirv_	if you can compile your own kernel though, I imagine things are fairly straight forward
2016-04-09 08:51:04	mirv_	just as an fyi as well, I have both xf86-video-ati and xf86-video-amdgpu installed
2016-04-09 08:51:09	mirv_	pretty sure both are required

2016-04-09 10:43:10	gnarface	just curious, which do you guys think would probably be more popular to watch; new popular games, new unpopular/rare games, or something from my extensive library of shitty games written before most of you guys were born?

2016-04-09 10:46:12	gnarface	(it may enter into the evaluation of this choice, the fact i don't have enough upstream bandwidth to stream anything in HD, so regardless of the game's native resolution locally, the publication would likely be limited to standard def. or lower)
2016-04-09 10:50:27	Arthur_D	no idea :P
2016-04-09 10:51:10	Arthur_D	popular games are typically... most popular, probably in all circumstances
2016-04-09 10:51:10		[10:51]
2016-04-09 10:51:56	gnarface	maybe? but that seems counter-intuitive to me.  some games that are very popular to play aren't as popular to watch as others
2016-04-09 10:52:02	Arthur_D	though I am unsure if the world needs more Minecraft, GTA etc videos
2016-04-09 10:52:17	kkit	but you also have the problem of everyone else playing the same game
2016-04-09 10:52:26	kkit	like i bet there's a lot of folks streaming enter the gungeon this weekend
2016-04-09 10:53:06	gnarface	right, there's the concept of "the long tail of the search" if you want your content to be found; you want to hit the sweet spot between total obscurity and a saturated market for a given subject
2016-04-09 10:53:28	gnarface	but a crowded market isn't necessarily an impoverished one too...
2016-04-09 10:54:11	Arthur_D	I dunno, just make videos of the games you like to play
2016-04-09 10:54:26	gnarface	anyway, that's a more fine-grained analysis than i meant this question to pose; i was simply polling to gauge the type of demand for one category of games over another
2016-04-09 10:55:12	gnarface	right now if i was gonna make a video of a game i would like to play, it'd be a Civ5 video, but i doubt it'd be watchable after transcoding the video stream down to 640x480
2016-04-09 10:55:36	gnarface	and either way it'd be boring as fuck to watch, i assume
2016-04-09 10:55:48	Arthur_D	from what I've observed, the popular streamers get popular because of personalities and to some degree concept, rather than what games they play
2016-04-09 10:56:31	gnarface	hmm. interesting, so you think the game doesn't matter at all, and its more about cleavage?
2016-04-09 10:56:40	Arthur_D	well it does matter some of course
2016-04-09 10:56:47	Arthur_D	but cleavage helps
2016-04-09 10:57:21	Arthur_D	and a good "radio" voice, witty commentary/rage or whatevs
2016-04-09 10:57:37	gnarface	i guess i was afraid of that, i was just hoping to find some games that were the right combination of weird and obscure enough they'd stand a chance of drawing a small crowd simply because of the novelty
2016-04-09 10:58:09	Arthur_D	possibly, but I reckon it's difficult to actually find that audience, or get them to find you
2016-04-09 10:58:25	Arthur_D	unless they are searching for it obviously
2016-04-09 10:58:43	Arthur_D	might be I'm just too negative now though
2016-04-09 10:59:11	gnarface	hard to say, but your assumptions match my own
2016-04-09 11:00:02	Arthur_D	yes, they are largely assumptions, I do not really watch people play games myself much, I've seen once in a while a video but not a lot
2016-04-09 11:00:33	kkit	yeah, i don't watch streamers for the game, necessarily
2016-04-09 11:00:42	kkit	the game is secondary
2016-04-09 11:00:50	stqn	I’m not interesting in watching people play games
2016-04-09 11:01:20	gnarface	i can't really understand the market for it either, but its undeniably a large and growing market.  it was a surprise to me that starcraft2 is so popular to watch, though someone told me that having announcers like a proper football game makes a big difference
2016-04-09 11:01:20	stqn	unless it’s a game I want to learn more about and find out if it’s worth buying it
2016-04-09 11:01:26	stqn	interested*
2016-04-09 11:02:12	Arthur_D	gnarface: well StarCraft is esport material, kinda in another league as most games go
2016-04-09 11:04:55	gnarface	alas, my world of warcraft pvp guild evaporated before the advent of twitch.tv, or things may have gone differently for me
2016-04-09 11:05:39	Arthur_D	if you want to make game videos, instead of streaming it maybe record locally, and accept that at least for the first while you won't have many viewers
2016-04-09 11:06:11	Arthur_D	the market is kinda saturated in my opinion
2016-04-09 11:06:11		[11:06]
2016-04-09 11:06:12	gnarface	there is always that, though that destroys any chance of interactivity
2016-04-09 11:06:49	Arthur_D	that's true, but if you don't have the connection for it I dunno if streaming is a good option
2016-04-09 11:09:30	Arthur_D	on the other hand, you don't have a lot to lose apart from time
2016-04-09 11:09:57	Arthur_D	so you could try and see what happens :)
2016-04-09 11:10:10	gnarface	yea
2016-04-09 11:10:12	gnarface	that's true
2016-04-09 11:10:36	gnarface	but i guess that's one of the reasons i was gravitating to older games, because they wouldn't suffer as much from being streamed in low res
2016-04-09 11:11:31	Arthur_D	quite a few newer 2D games that would probably not suffer a lot too
2016-04-09 11:11:35	stqn	the world is saturated
2016-04-09 11:12:03	Arthur_D	yo momma is saturated
2016-04-09 11:12:05	Arthur_D	idk
2016-04-09 11:12:12	gnarface	Arthur_D: probably, but with newer games there's definitely a risk of important text on the screen being too small to be legible after its been shrunk to NTSC
2016-04-09 11:12:30	Arthur_D	hmm fair point
2016-04-09 11:12:54	gnarface	with older games designed for the classic 12" color CRT, they were generally more cautious about putting too much text on the screen at once
2016-04-09 11:13:15	Arthur_D	I guess it's the Monkey Island games for you my friend ;)

2016-04-09 11:16:00	Arthur_D	poor replayability value though
2016-04-09 11:16:17	stqn	what I meant is that due to the way money is created (by private bankers for their own benefit) around the world, and the way most politicians are only trying to make life better for them and not for the everyone, people are trying anything they can to earn money, including making indie games and posting videos on youtube and streaming and doing patreon stuff, but every market is being saturated

2016-04-09 12:10:43	drumr7	most of those services allow you to export playlists and collections information to import into others
2016-04-09 12:10:47	drumr7	i went through that with rdio
2016-04-09 12:11:04	drumr7	there are web sites dedicated to porting/converting lists
2016-04-09 12:11:15	drumr7	rdio allowed to download user data to port to another
2016-04-09 12:11:25	drumr7	in that respect
2016-04-09 12:15:13	Arthur_D	Sure but if there are lots of smaller labels owning the rights, like in my case, I may find huge swaths of my playlist unavailable
2016-04-09 12:15:13		[12:15]
2016-04-09 12:17:40	Arthur_D	Anyway, buying all those albums would probably be difficult, both cost-wise and finding copies in a convenient format
2016-04-09 12:19:00	Arthur_D	So I'm glad Spotify got popular enough to get such a large library :)

2016-04-11 10:21:48	Smilex	I've actually wondered if the reason whoever decided to move from just files to directories like source.list.d, did it to avoid the premission issue

2016-04-11 10:23:06	toastedmilk	gnarface: i assume uchicago is fine enough as far as debian sources.  if you have your reservations i'd love to hear them
2016-04-11 10:23:35	gnarface	Smilex: i assume the "whatever.d" subdirectory mechanism for appending configuration was for ease of package management; if you look into automated bootstrapping of systems at all, the first problem you run into is sanely editing non-stock configs without user intervention.
2016-04-11 10:24:03	gnarface	Smilex: i.e., its just a simple mechanism for modularizing configs
2016-04-11 10:24:26	Smilex	gnarface: yeah makes sense
2016-04-11 10:25:02	gnarface	with these sub-directory config snippets, then deployment of literally any service or software can be dumbed down to "unzip files, restart daemon"
2016-04-11 10:25:06	Smilex	but I don't see why there couldn't be a simple database like tool, or whatever instead
2016-04-11 10:25:08	toastedmilk	gnarface: thanks for the help.  sorry for the newbie perspective - should i run into any other qualms, im sure i'll be back
2016-04-11 10:25:30	Smilex	either way, it's not worth thinking about

2016-04-11 10:28:48	gnarface	think, the difference beteween the IRS tax code, and the 10 commandments.  say what you will about either, but i doubt the tax code will last 2000 years
2016-04-11 10:28:53	Smilex	I guess. But I can avoid the complexity because I don't need the features, yet I don't get that option for many things
2016-04-11 10:29:32	gnarface	i think its a lot about the mentality of the type of people who write one type of software over the other
2016-04-11 10:29:42	Smilex	I actually do very much appreciate getting less. It also means I can look at stuff and understand it
2016-04-11 10:30:00	Smilex	that's really what I appreciate most about simple stuff
2016-04-11 10:30:27	gnarface	there's definitely opposing mentalities in software development world in this regard.  some people want their software to outlive them, and some people are terrified their software might last longer than their own employment
2016-04-11 10:30:41	Smilex	gnarface: I'm thinking that maybe a lot of Linux stuff is actually written for server people and aren't exactly fitting for a good desktop experience
2016-04-11 10:31:35	gnarface	Smilex: well, since most linux stuff is written by and for its own users, that's probably an accurate statement, but one that's changing fast.  historically linux was dominated by server people who really know their shit, but ubuntu is changing that....
2016-04-11 10:32:03	gnarface	so now we have a lot of really old stuff that's a great textbook example of how to make software that will outlive you
2016-04-11 10:32:37	gnarface	but on the other hand we have a lot of new exciting experimental desktop-ware that's a great textbook example of software that would normally get you fired
2016-04-11 10:33:06	gnarface	luckily "getting fired" from writing your own software for free isn't really a concern
2016-04-11 10:33:15	gnarface	lucky for them at least
2016-04-11 10:33:27	gnarface	i pity all those poor Gnome users who were forced to upgrade from 2 to 3 though
2016-04-11 10:34:05	gnarface	Apple has fired tenured employees over comparatively trivial errors in judgement
2016-04-11 10:34:07	gnarface	but gnome lives on
2016-04-11 10:34:16	gnarface	open source software cannot be stopped at this point
2016-04-11 10:34:34	toastedmilk	gnarface: is this not going to work at all if i can't get fglrx? i have a crappy(and old) intel integrated graphics controller
2016-04-11 10:34:57	toastedmilk	gnarface: hm let me just give it a shot - ill find out soon enough.
2016-04-11 10:35:08	gnarface	toastedmilk: steam should work fine for intel graphics, some games will not though
2016-04-11 10:35:20	toastedmilk	gnarface: cross fingers for civ v
2016-04-11 10:35:32	gnarface	toastedmilk: i've heard it works fine with intel graphics, you might need to update though
2016-04-11 10:40:33	Arthur_D	forced from Gnome 2 to XFCE and Mate you mean :)
2016-04-11 10:40:33		[10:40]
2016-04-11 10:41:55	gnarface	Arthur_D: heh, maybe i dunno. for the record, the transition from Gnome 1 to Gnome 2 was what lost me
2016-04-11 10:46:46	TwistedFate	gnarface,
2016-04-11 10:46:57	TwistedFate	installed civ5, works like a charm
2016-04-11 10:47:08	TwistedFate	we can play tomorrow if you like :)
2016-04-11 10:47:11	gnarface	TwistedFate: on windows you mean?
2016-04-11 10:47:16	TwistedFate	yea
2016-04-11 10:47:19	gnarface	TwistedFate: f u
2016-04-11 10:47:21	Arthur_D	actually I went to XFCE and then to KDE after Gnome 2
2016-04-11 10:47:39	TwistedFate	gnarface, why? xD
2016-04-11 10:47:44	gnarface	TwistedFate: lol, traitor!
2016-04-11 10:48:23	TwistedFate	aww, i will come back to it.. one day.. in a 10 years or so lol :)
2016-04-11 10:48:28	gnarface	TwistedFate: i want you to benchmark Civ5 bootup.  tell me if it launches any faster in windows
2016-04-11 10:48:43	TwistedFate	gnarface, it actually does, thats the first thing i noticed
2016-04-11 10:48:50	gnarface	i bet if you time it, its the exact same amount of time
2016-04-11 10:49:11	gnarface	initial startup, after cold boot
2016-04-11 10:49:12	gnarface	not re-start
2016-04-11 10:49:16	TwistedFate	even the game/match itself loaded faster
2016-04-11 10:49:25	TwistedFate	i will do that as well
2016-04-11 10:49:28	 *	gnarface would have to see it to believe it
2016-04-11 10:49:42	Smilex	TwistedFate: which filesystem did you use on Linux? Ext 2?
2016-04-11 10:49:51	TwistedFate	Smilex, no ext4
2016-04-11 10:49:56	gnarface	hmm
2016-04-11 10:50:24	gnarface	i'm not using ext4
2016-04-11 10:50:28	Smilex	ok cool. I just heard a mention today that ext was very slow compared to Windows. No idea which version of ext they meant, or if there was any truth to it
2016-04-11 10:50:45	gnarface	Smilex: i'm not using ext4 because it felt slow to me
2016-04-11 10:50:54	Smilex	I'm using btrfs. Probably a bad idea, but I just can't help myself from trying the new cool shit
2016-04-11 10:51:01	TwistedFate	strange, i always got impression from people that ext is superior than ntfs
2016-04-11 10:51:11	gnarface	Smilex: i have a feeling it depends on the type of drive; drives with native 1k physical sectors might be faster for ext4
2016-04-11 10:51:22	Smilex	TwistedFate: well from Linux people you mean?
2016-04-11 10:51:37	Smilex	gnarface: Yeah I have no idea about any of this stuff
2016-04-11 10:51:52	Smilex	I just know that moving on Ext us much faster than on NTFS
2016-04-11 10:52:15	TwistedFate	Smilex, well, yeah
2016-04-11 10:52:22	TwistedFate	Smilex, tried zfs?
2016-04-11 10:53:03	gnarface	i doubt zfs could be faster in a single-disk configuration, but i don't think that's why you use zfs
2016-04-11 10:53:20	Smilex	TwistedFate: No. I did want to, but it wasn't as easy as btrfs, so I just went with it
2016-04-11 10:53:23	gnarface	you use zfs for checksumming and network transparency
2016-04-11 10:53:31	Smilex	although it warned me about being not well tested
2016-04-11 10:53:50	gnarface	Smilex: i hear if you want a good zfs experience, to use bsd
2016-04-11 10:54:27	gnarface	its a core feature in bsd's kernel now, as opposed to having been bolted on later to linux
2016-04-11 10:54:31	TwistedFate	isnt openindiana better choice?
2016-04-11 10:54:45	Arthur_D	I'm conservative when it comes to software, so I'm waiting with ZFS and BTRFS until I'm sure it's both stable enough and a better choice
2016-04-11 10:55:00	gnarface	sorry i think i should have said in the bsds' kernels

2016-04-12 04:20:29	@NaughtySquid	i wonder how many feathers i will ruffle with my views on this rust gender thing
2016-04-12 04:20:40	calexil	jimmies will be rustled
2016-04-12 04:20:52	stqn	I don’t use Mint anymore anyway, used it for a few months… Not gonna touch it again because systemd, gtk3.
2016-04-12 04:22:04	mirv_	calexil, you can't trick relying upon specific libraries
2016-04-12 04:22:44	calexil	ah
2016-04-12 04:22:45	calexil	well
2016-04-12 04:22:48	mirv_	and by specific libraries, I mean the ones they modified and packaged in there
2016-04-12 04:22:53	mirv_	they don't use the defaults
2016-04-12 04:22:53	calexil	maybe they fix that in the future
2016-04-12 04:23:17	mirv_	"maybe"
2016-04-12 04:23:46	mirv_	this is why FOSS drivers are insanely better for everybody
2016-04-12 04:28:12	@NaughtySquid	turns out in Rust I am male
2016-04-12 04:28:17	@NaughtySquid	with a tiny willy
2016-04-12 04:28:33	@NaughtySquid	and black

2016-04-12 04:28:39	@NaughtySquid	not that it matters to me, it's a game :)
2016-04-12 04:28:43	@Samsai	so the randomization mechanic is completely accurate
2016-04-12 04:28:50	@NaughtySquid	hahaha
2016-04-12 04:28:53	@NaughtySquid	buuurn
2016-04-12 04:29:21	mirv_	the developers only had themselves for reference purposes
2016-04-12 04:29:26	mirv_	(yes, I feel like being mean today)

2016-04-12 04:30:15	@Samsai	better subscribe to the comments, this might get juicy
2016-04-12 04:31:18	@NaughtySquid	oh yeah i totally need to do that
2016-04-12 04:31:37		Nothing_Much (~nothing_m@unaffiliated/nothing-much/x-2931824) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-04-12 04:31:45	GermainZ	at random? why
2016-04-12 04:32:27	tadzik	to be lifelike
2016-04-12 04:32:48	GermainZ	but assigning a random gender instead of letting the player choose their own is weird
2016-04-12 04:32:58	@NaughtySquid	it's also a social experiment, garry likes the fuck with the players to see what happens
2016-04-12 04:32:58	GermainZ	I didn't read the article though, just commenting based on the title
2016-04-12 04:32:58	GermainZ	:p
2016-04-12 04:33:09	@Samsai	you don't pick your gender in real life either!
2016-04-12 04:33:19	@Samsai	and rust is 100% true to reality!
2016-04-12 04:33:21	GermainZ	¯\_ʕ·ᴥ·ʔ_/¯
2016-04-12 04:33:29	@NaughtySquid	GermainZ: plenty of games have a male or female only character at certain points
2016-04-12 04:33:32	@NaughtySquid	not all games let you pick
2016-04-12 04:33:36	@NaughtySquid	(and who cares!)
2016-04-12 04:33:45	GermainZ	me
2016-04-12 04:33:53	@NaughtySquid	of course you would
2016-04-12 04:33:59	GermainZ	I like picking females for ranged characters and males for melee characters
2016-04-12 04:34:07	@Samsai	yeah, i see it as (just) a social experiment (bro) and a publicity stunt
2016-04-12 04:34:21	@NaughtySquid	a great one
2016-04-12 04:34:24	@NaughtySquid	got me to write about it
2016-04-12 04:35:04	GermainZ	is there a way to filter out articles about "might come" and "coming soon" games?
2016-04-12 04:35:31	@NaughtySquid	no
2016-04-12 04:35:37	@NaughtySquid	i force you to read all my shit
2016-04-12 04:35:49	GermainZ	damn it
2016-04-12 04:37:20	@NaughtySquid	see
2016-04-12 04:37:22	@NaughtySquid	lifes not fair
2016-04-12 04:37:37	GermainZ	it's ok
2016-04-12 04:37:40	GermainZ	I forgive you bb
2016-04-12 04:40:55	sziszi	i like female  characters because they got plus persuade ptions in many games
2016-04-12 04:42:36	sziszi	this was unbalanced.. males could get some threatening options but nope :(
2016-04-12 04:43:19	stqn	+strength maybe
2016-04-12 04:43:43	@Samsai	i see one interesting thing about this
2016-04-12 04:43:43		[04:43]
2016-04-12 04:44:55	@Samsai	in some games, particularly MMORPGs etc, female characters can take advantage of their in-game gender (along with some acting skills) to get free stuff from male players
2016-04-12 04:45:38	@Samsai	i guess that tactic won't work too well in rust now that everyone's gender is random
2016-04-12 04:46:46	mirv_	I think it was a, uh, dick move, on the part of the devs
2016-04-12 04:46:54	@NaughtySquid	i dont
2016-04-12 04:47:06	@Samsai	we've seen many dick moves from rust devs already
2016-04-12 04:47:16	@Samsai	the whole game has been full of dicks since the beginning
2016-04-12 04:47:17	@Samsai	literally

2016-04-12 04:47:47	@Samsai	if anything the amount of dickery has been reduced by this update
2016-04-12 04:51:49	@Samsai	so, NaughtySquid
2016-04-12 04:52:05	@Samsai	quoting you, your character is "the exact opposite" of you?
2016-04-12 04:52:15	@NaughtySquid	banned
2016-04-12 04:52:30	@Samsai	are you implying you are a white woman with a huge dick?
2016-04-12 04:52:32	mirv_	NaughtySquid, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this particular topic
2016-04-12 04:53:00	@NaughtySquid	mirv_: fair enough
2016-04-12 04:54:21	Smilex	Controversy! Well let me share my opinion on this
2016-04-12 04:54:25	Smilex	I'm kidding
2016-04-12 04:54:53	Dezponia	I agree to disagree with the opinion I disagree with (I don't want to read the backlog to find out. Just know I disagree with the wrong opinion)
2016-04-12 04:55:18	@NaughtySquid	Samsai: i don't consider myself any gender, true story, i'm awesome
2016-04-12 04:55:25	mirv_	being an opinion, I don't think there's a "right" or "wrong"
2016-04-12 04:55:40	@Samsai	i disagree with all of your just out of spite

2016-04-12 04:58:02	@Samsai	so it's probably fine to say either
2016-04-12 04:58:05	EddDeDuck	ha Just catching up on that, many seasons behind

2016-04-12 04:59:47	@Samsai	Dezponia, there haven't been any tyrians in skyrim for 50 years
2016-04-12 04:59:53	mirv_	personally, John Snow sounded like a pretty cool guy

2016-04-12 05:11:38	EddDeDuck	I think we’ve watched about 75% of them now depending on which ones are rotated on TV
2016-04-12 05:11:45	EddDeDuck	Yeah movie was a DVD
2016-04-12 05:12:11	EddDeDuck	but it was used once to rip to plex then back into the box never to be reopened.

2016-04-12 05:15:52	mirv_	ok, that I didn't know
2016-04-12 05:15:53	EddDeDuck	Yeah Nvidia hate is strong :(
2016-04-12 05:16:14	mirv_	nvidia can play along with standards just like everyone else
2016-04-12 05:16:29	calexil	ohhai edddeduck
2016-04-12 05:16:34	mirv_	(not knowing what's in the patches, I can't say what they were up to)
2016-04-12 05:16:37	EddDeDuck	It’s hard to follow all the technical pro’s and con’s but it did seem a lot of the rejection was based on Nvidia is evil not their technical arguments
2016-04-12 05:16:49	calexil	I tried to get amdgpu-pro working on mint and failed
2016-04-12 05:16:50	@NaughtySquid	dont auto assume nvidia is at fault mirv_
2016-04-12 05:17:02	Smilex	mirv_: I wanted to just patch them in myself to try, and I think there was a bit of EGL stuff for wayland
2016-04-12 05:17:13	EddDeDuck	I think both sides have a point from my reading of it all (in a semi technical level)

2016-04-12 05:17:29	@NaughtySquid	I have a feeling Mir is going to leaving Wayland in its dust

2016-04-12 05:17:43	Dezponia	NaughtySquid: That I find highly unlikely
2016-04-12 05:17:57	Smilex	of course the only issue I had, which turned out to be impossible for me to solve unless I joined the mailing list, was to actually download the patches without getting HTML formatting
2016-04-12 05:17:59	EddDeDuck	Problem is if you are too stubborn and tell Nvidia to go away then you’re shooting yourself in the foot
2016-04-12 05:18:00	@NaughtySquid	well, Mir already ships on devices doesn't it? Ubuntu Phone?
2016-04-12 05:18:06	mirv_	NaughtySquid, that's why I said I can't say what they were up to
2016-04-12 05:18:16	Dezponia	NaughtySquid: So has Wayland forever? Sailfish
2016-04-12 05:18:33	@NaughtySquid	mirv_: "nvidia can play along with standards just like everyone else" - auto firing at nivida
2016-04-12 05:18:34	mirv_	I can understand not wanting nvidia (or anything else) blob-specific work-arounds
2016-04-12 05:18:45	EddDeDuck	Ask anyone with an Nvidia card would you like Wayland and Mesa based drivers which give poor performance and features (and no Vulkan) or would you like Mir with Vulcan and full OpenGL?
2016-04-12 05:19:00	mirv_	NaughtySquid, I thought my next statement had implied that it might not be nvidia at fault
2016-04-12 05:19:14	@Samsai	from what i've read the problem with the nvidia patches is that wayland would have to contain two methods of doing something, one specific to nvidia and one for other drivers
2016-04-12 05:19:15	EddDeDuck	I’m hopeful they’ll find some middle ground
2016-04-12 05:19:17	 *	calexil feels ignored

2016-04-12 05:21:00	Dezponia	NaughtySquid: Wayland has been in stuff far longer than Mir if I recall but honestly thats sort of irrelevant since the battle most of us care about is on the desktop right now :)
2016-04-12 05:21:45	Dezponia	NaughtySquid: Agreed. Dont get why Canonical had to NiH it again... especially when the stuff they "invented" Mir for was essentially just code already written with Wayland in mind
2016-04-12 05:23:18	EddDeDuck	NaughtySquid Agreed, it’s one of the downsides of opensource sometimes nobody is in charge so you end up with duplication of effort
2016-04-12 05:23:34	@NaughtySquid	well there are people in charge
2016-04-12 05:23:43	@NaughtySquid	but Mark Shuttleworth tried explaining it
2016-04-12 05:23:52	@NaughtySquid	and people weren't happy as Wayland already existeds

2016-04-12 05:25:47	EddDeDuck	I read it as Nvidia saying the current way is a bit crap and their way would be better for everyone in the longer term and Wayland dev’s disagreed….
2016-04-12 05:26:08	EddDeDuck	Who is correct in that argument is for greater minds than mine :)
2016-04-12 05:26:42	EddDeDuck	I’ve met the Nvidia engineers (Linux ones) and they live and breath Linux
2016-04-12 05:26:51	Yamagata	It's also only a disagreement on implementation for Weston, isn't it? It doesn't affect any of the other Wayland display servers as nVidia exposed the needed EGL interfaces.
2016-04-12 05:26:55	mirv_	the correct way it something suitable for everyone, especially at this point in time for Wayland
2016-04-12 05:26:58	Dezponia	EddDeDuck: But do they run Crysis on Linux on a potato?
2016-04-12 05:27:24	Yamagata	Weston isn't used in production, though I can understand wanting to be deliberate about your example software.
2016-04-12 05:28:11	EddDeDuck	They are pasionate about Linux and want Linux to be awesome and they honestly belive what they do with the Nvidia drivers and decisions they make are for the good of the platform as well as Nvidia. Doesnt mean they are always right but they do get a lot of stick for people who are all massive linux advocates personally as well as professionally.
2016-04-12 05:29:25	Dezponia	Either way Wayland is running great with GNOME 3.20 on the FLOSS drivers and I couldn't be happier right now :)
2016-04-12 05:29:25		[05:29]
2016-04-12 05:29:35	EddDeDuck	That said I have no clue if the Wayland thing is corect either way :)

2016-04-12 05:29:48	EddDeDuck	I think they don’t want the abuse

2016-04-12 05:30:51	Dezponia	Bridgman from AMD is basically a machine to be able to handle those forums. Especially as an AMD employee :P
2016-04-12 05:31:17	EddDeDuck	AMD do get a lot of love too
2016-04-12 05:31:24	EddDeDuck	for their open source stuff
2016-04-12 05:31:38	EddDeDuck	He does do a good job
2016-04-12 05:31:43	Dezponia	Still its nice to see that they're caching up rather well with VULKAN now rather than OpenGL and their free software efforts are commendable, even if the firmware is still closed
2016-04-12 05:31:58	EddDeDuck	Handling some of the comments can be hard
2016-04-12 05:32:34	EddDeDuck	when you’ve worked weekends and someone then dismisses all the work with some 4 letter words… Bit that’s the internet :)
2016-04-12 05:32:40	EddDeDuck	*But
2016-04-12 05:34:04	Smilex	both Mir and Wayland have more complicated APIs than the window creation portion of X does. Personally I see that as a step backwards
2016-04-12 05:34:14	stqn	like Vulkan!
2016-04-12 05:34:24	stqn	 </troll>
2016-04-12 05:34:46	EddDeDuck	Smilex, when you have a proper compositor then you’ll loose performance and add complexity
2016-04-12 05:34:50	Smilex	stqn: you might be right actually
2016-04-12 05:35:12	Smilex	EddDeDuck: I don't know much about the details
2016-04-12 05:35:14	Yamagata	Smilex, part of the idea is also that you don't interact with either directly. You use a widget-ing toolkit like you would 90% of the time with X as well, or you use SDL or something similar if all you need is a window with custom everything in it.
2016-04-12 05:35:31	EddDeDuck	Windows (and Mac) lost performance when they took away the ability to control the card and monitor directly and forced you to use the OS to control windows via a compositor.
2016-04-12 05:35:52	Smilex	EddDeDuck: and isn't that what Wayland does?
2016-04-12 05:35:57	EddDeDuck	yep
2016-04-12 05:36:04	Smilex	EddDeDuck: so it's a bad thing?

2016-04-12 05:36:22	EddDeDuck	However when things crashes your OS didn’t lose control, you can also have things like OS popups over full screen applications etc.
2016-04-12 05:36:37	EddDeDuck	It’s not a bad thing but you will trade a little performance for all the features
2016-04-12 05:36:48	Yamagata	That's the entire point of unredirecting fullscreen applications: bypass the compositor. Otherwise, compositors expose problems you get in floating window managers regardless because it's a tough problem to render all that performantly and correctly regardless of approach.

2016-04-12 05:37:39	Dezponia	For me one of the biggest Pros of Wayland is the improved security
2016-04-12 05:38:58	Yamagata	Maintainability of better defined codebases is another big win compared to X for any compositor implementing Wayland (same with Mir as well; shedding decades of half-baked ideas helps with fixing bugs and adding features heh)
2016-04-12 05:39:13	EddDeDuck	I don’t think its a bad trade off

2016-04-12 05:40:08	Yamagata	Heh
2016-04-12 05:40:31	@Samsai	Dezponia, that's all covered by the fact that there is mir and wayland
2016-04-12 05:40:43	@Samsai	so they can always duplicate each other's efforts
2016-04-12 05:40:46	Dezponia	Samsai: Ahhh! So that was Marks master plan!
2016-04-12 05:40:58	EddDeDuck	haha :)
2016-04-12 05:41:04	EddDeDuck	Geniune lol for that joke
2016-04-12 05:43:44	stqn	there’s not much performance loss when using a compositor on linux, at least compared to double buffering with vsync it’s a win :)
2016-04-12 05:43:58	stqn	compared to triple buffering I don’t know…
2016-04-12 05:44:53	Yamagata	The worst visible performance problem with compositors comes from sample rate of the compositor and how it hits your monitor's refresh. The internal fps of a game might be high, but if it's out of sync slightly with the draw timing of the compositor and then badly synced to the monitor, 120 fps could look like 7
2016-04-12 05:44:53		[05:44]
2016-04-12 05:45:17	Yamagata	That's often what seems to produce the biggest feeling of sluggishness and weird performance whenever I'm not running fullscreen
2016-04-12 05:46:30	stqn	I have noticed that if I disable vsync in some games (eg Talos) and they run at more than 60 FPS, but I use Compton to vsync, then the game stutters a bit
2016-04-12 05:46:45	stqn	enabling vsync ingame fixes it
2016-04-12 05:47:58	Yamagata	Usually any compositor should reasonably respect and application setting vsync via an API like OpenGL
2016-04-12 05:48:03	EddDeDuck	yeah I need to get some spare time so we can dedicate a week to the craziness of all that stuff :)
2016-04-12 05:48:10	Yamagata	Depends on the application though
2016-04-12 05:49:18	stqn	Yamagata: well the only reason I use compton is to remove tearing so I want it to vsync everywhere all the time
2016-04-12 05:49:18	calexil	I couldnt get compton to play nice with amdgpu-pro
2016-04-12 05:49:19	calexil	at all

2016-04-12 21:56:57	Cracker	I'm afraid of the VP port for Bohemia.  Not because I'm against wrappers but I feel with the type of game Arma 3 is, the Linux port is always going to be behind and their will be issues with mods
2016-04-12 21:57:31	Cracker	I hope I'm proven wrong though ;)
2016-04-12 22:00:23	homerj	well, wrappers are more how they are used
2016-04-12 22:00:40	@Samsai	i certainly will be waiting until the status is a bit more official than it is
2016-04-12 22:00:48	homerj	I mean, technically, more games are "wrappers", even native, and even on Windows
2016-04-12 22:01:00	homerj	s/more/most
2016-04-12 22:01:01	GolBot	homerj meant to say: I mean, technically, most games are "wrappers", even native, and even on Windows
2016-04-12 22:03:00	homerj	SDL is a wrapper

2016-04-12 22:05:16	Cracker	Well I hope I'm wrong about it but I see a big issue with delaying releases...
2016-04-12 22:05:35	Cracker	I realize that many games use wrappers to some degree
2016-04-12 22:06:46	homerj	but something like a game that just has a d3d and opengl renderer, obviously in there there is a "myFancyGraphicsCall()" and then decides if it's D3D or OpenGL and points to either a d3d or opengl call
2016-04-12 22:06:53	homerj	and maybe move around the data to fit

2016-04-12 22:15:40	homerj	I'm strictly a Linux user, so games that really aren't on Windows I don't really follow as in want to play them
2016-04-12 22:15:55	homerj	I don't even have a Windows install if I wanted to play it

2016-04-12 22:17:44	homerj	so why exactly was I using Windows?
2016-04-12 22:17:56	Cracker	I do, their software is crap

2016-04-12 22:22:48	Cracker	This is what I'm seeing.  "Extra delays for the ports".  My question is, how often is this going to happen?  How many times are they going to push the ports to the back burner on updates because of x,y, or z.  Also, it states they will support it for another year.
2016-04-12 22:23:00	Cracker	These are my concerns currently with Arma 3
2016-04-12 22:23:33	Dwarden	the delays are because it's 3rd party and you can do it post release, it's not native port
2016-04-12 22:23:48	Cracker	I'm sorry I should have quoted differently
2016-04-12 22:23:52	Cracker	"our QA teams needed to prioritize 1.56 testing of the primary Windows version, causing extra delays for the ports."
2016-04-12 22:24:01	Cracker	Looks like it's Bohemia's QA team by the sound of that
2016-04-12 22:24:16	Dwarden	but the quality and feedback helped to decide we can speed the ports releases
2016-04-12 22:24:17	Cracker	Dwarden:  that is much of my fear

2016-04-12 22:27:49	Cracker	haha
2016-04-12 22:28:11	Cracker	Some of them are, some of them are friends of friends of friends...
2016-04-12 22:28:18	Cracker	so downgrading is not a valid option, sorry
2016-04-12 22:28:35	Ysblokje	Thats why I play with friends of the first order
2016-04-12 22:28:51	Ysblokje	No snowballing downgrades that way
2016-04-12 22:28:52	Dwarden	like i said we will try speed it up but there still some obstacles to slay first
2016-04-12 22:28:57	Cracker	Well that's fine, but that doesn't have anything to do with my concerns ;)
2016-04-12 22:29:06	Cracker	Dwarden: I'm sure, porting is a pain
2016-04-12 22:29:11	Cracker	hell game development is a pain
2016-04-12 22:29:17	Dwarden	it's not, it's the bugs what make the ports being pita
2016-04-12 22:29:25	Cracker	I'm not up in arms about it.  Just stating my concerns about the port is all
2016-04-12 22:29:32	Ysblokje	Dwarden, is there a way to signup for "sanity" testing for the port?
2016-04-12 22:29:32	Dwarden	so let say you have this random memory leaks problem, tough nut to crack
2016-04-12 22:29:38	Dwarden	you do port, it's triples ;)
2016-04-12 22:30:08	Cracker	Dwarden:  I know it's difficult and I'm not trying to sound like I'm not appreciating the port
2016-04-12 22:30:46	Dwarden	well, that's another problem, we were under some major attacks and they managed to knockoff all our trackers
2016-04-12 22:30:54	Dwarden	and it will take some time to deploy new systems
2016-04-12 22:30:56	Cracker	Like I said, Arma 3 is really the only game I actually want that I currently can't get
2016-04-12 22:31:28	Cracker	Even the dev blog says mods may be a problem
2016-04-12 22:31:37	Ysblokje	bwa
2016-04-12 22:31:45	Ysblokje	I got mods running just fine
2016-04-12 22:31:51	Cracker	That's good to know
2016-04-12 22:31:55	Ysblokje	just the oldskool
2016-04-12 22:31:56	Dwarden	so either our forums https://forums.bistudio.com/forum/196-arma-3-ports/ or directly to VP http://www.vpltd.com/support/

2016-04-12 22:31:58	Ysblokje	way
2016-04-12 22:32:10	Dwarden	Cracker mods will work fine
2016-04-12 22:32:21	Cracker	that is very good news
2016-04-12 22:32:23	Dwarden	as long as the engine loads them i see no reason why it would not work
2016-04-12 22:32:41	Cracker	I'm just going off what Bohemia's dev site says about it ;)
2016-04-12 22:32:42	Ysblokje	But we need that launcher , because the params are not fun to make ;)
2016-04-12 22:32:47	Dwarden	only exception could be mods using windows native callExtension but that's rare for 'client' side
2016-04-12 22:32:56	Cracker	or at least did at one point
2016-04-12 22:33:19	Dwarden	honestly, do not expect launcher to be on linux/mac ...
2016-04-12 22:33:35	Ysblokje	Was it writtin in windows assembly?
2016-04-12 22:33:43	Dwarden	something like that ;)
2016-04-12 22:34:12	Cracker	Hurmmm
2016-04-12 22:34:25	Cracker	Visual Basic maybe?  ;)
2016-04-12 22:34:33	Ysblokje	Does it use the steam api to get a list of installed workshop mods>?
2016-04-12 22:34:53	 *	Ysblokje has been looking into that to write his own launcher
2016-04-12 22:35:12	Ysblokje	cant find proper docs to get that info from steam
2016-04-12 22:35:22	Cracker	So there are no plans for a launcher for the Linux port?
2016-04-12 22:36:45	Ysblokje	Dwarden are you VP or Bohemia employed? just curious
2016-04-12 22:37:23	Dwarden	BI
2016-04-12 22:37:41	Ysblokje	ok
2016-04-12 22:37:57	Dwarden	Cracker when the Launcher was started to develop the Linux/Mac ports were more of dreamland ;(
2016-04-12 22:38:24	Dwarden	so it wasn't calculated with it and thus porting it to linux is unfeasible monstrosity
2016-04-12 22:39:17	Dwarden	ofc i might be wrong and another miracle may happen but in this case one need to be realistic
2016-04-12 22:40:05	Dwarden	cracker , the issue with mods is related to the delay
2016-04-12 22:40:33	Dwarden	e.g. new version introduces new script commands or alternate syntaxes (expanding existing ones) or serious performance improvements to previously slow ones
2016-04-12 22:41:15	Dwarden	thus the community will aim toward that 'fresh' version and of course legacy / ports older version will be out of luck
2016-04-12 22:41:15		[22:41]
2016-04-12 22:41:18	Cracker	Well I hope it all pulls together
2016-04-12 22:41:58	Dwarden	i'm quite sure if 3 years ago someone said that he has Linux and runs Arma 3 with 2 frames more than Windows, someone will call him troll ;)
2016-04-12 22:42:05	Dwarden	now, nearly reality
2016-04-12 22:42:23	NuSuey	(don't want to disturb the discussion but .. kazdopadne vam drzime palce Dwarden ;) )
2016-04-12 22:42:26	Ysblokje	So far I'm grateful for BI to let VP port it. Been playing OFP since release in ~2001(?) always wanted a linux version of those kinds of games
2016-04-12 22:44:24	NuSuey	Ysblokje: still remember the days when I was unable to run of doom 1 on red hat via rpm and slow internet didn't help either.. and now? Arma 3 kinda-soon-ish? amazing.. :)
2016-04-12 22:44:50	Ysblokje	NuSuey, that means we're getting old my friend

2016-04-12 23:20:42	Smilex	and the game also prioritizes animations ahead of player actions, so if you get to close to a wall or something, the game might decide to play a dumb animation instead of shoot

2016-04-13 00:07:18	EddDeDuck	I’m just wondering if the need for LLVM fixes for compute in 11.3 mesa means that we’ll have to wait for a new Ubuntu before it can be supported again.

2016-04-13 00:12:25	@NaughtySquid	what game is this for?
2016-04-13 00:13:06	EddDeDuck	Well 11.2 is needed to good support on GRID
2016-04-13 00:13:15	EddDeDuck	but 11.3 will fix CoH2
2016-04-13 00:13:30	EddDeDuck	and adds compute so in theory will add Mordor and Alien to the Mesa listing

2016-04-13 00:50:22	@Samsai	it took ages before even oibaf started compiling their mesa with llvm 3.8
2016-04-13 00:50:59	EddDeDuck	All I would like to be abel to have is 16.04 users running 11.3 with compute_shader support which needs to be compiled with a new LLVM
2016-04-13 00:51:34	@Samsai	i think the padoka PPA uses a development version of LLVM to compile git mesa
2016-04-13 00:51:34	EddDeDuck	As long as it’s possible to create the driver with support for 16.04 that my primary concern
2016-04-13 00:51:42	@Samsai	so that will likely have it first
2016-04-13 00:51:56	EddDeDuck	yeah but IRC padoka didn’t wortk on 14.04 as that was too old?
2016-04-13 00:52:08	@Samsai	it doesn't
2016-04-13 00:52:09	EddDeDuck	or didn’t support GL4 anyway on on 14.04
2016-04-13 00:52:30	@Samsai	i think padoka only ships packages to recent ubuntu releases
2016-04-13 00:52:41	EddDeDuck	Basically having 16.04 having to wait until 18.04 for LTS support of GL4.3 would be a little :’(

2016-04-13 01:26:56	gnarface	what is this i hear about csmt being discontinued? wtf?
2016-04-13 01:27:10	gnarface	like they're giving up on it?
2016-04-13 01:29:27	stqn	I have read someone say that it is being moved in the official wine, and so meanwhile it has been removed from wine-staging
2016-04-13 01:29:57	stqn	because it was too much work to update the code or something.
2016-04-13 01:29:59	gnarface	oh i got the impression that it was broken in some places so they were giving up on it
2016-04-13 01:30:21	 *	gnarface would love to be wrong about this
2016-04-13 01:30:36	stqn	btw I wonder if WoW works for someone… hm
2016-04-13 01:30:56	gnarface	works for me in 1.9.6....
2016-04-13 01:31:01	gnarface	havn't tried 1.9.7
2016-04-13 01:31:50	stqn	apparently yes: https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=32314

2016-04-13 01:32:02	stqn	well the launcher and the game both don’t launch for me
2016-04-13 01:32:02		[01:32]
2016-04-13 01:32:09	stqn	I could try reinstalling from scratch
2016-04-13 01:32:29	gnarface	what was the last version you tried?
2016-04-13 01:32:32	gnarface	that worked i mean
2016-04-13 01:33:28	gnarface	i have come to expect frequent major regressions from wine
2016-04-13 01:33:31	gnarface	its a crap shoot every time
2016-04-13 01:33:44	gnarface	just because 1.9.6 works doesn't necessarily mean 1.9.7 would....
2016-04-13 01:34:31	gnarface	oh wait i may have had to manually update gnutls...
2016-04-13 01:34:34	stqn	someone did say "garbage" with 1.9.6
2016-04-13 01:35:03	stqn	as for the version, I don’t know, I was under the impression that it was an update of WoW that broke it, not an update of wine
2016-04-13 01:35:43	gnarface	stqn: at first, i couldn't log in, the launcher worked but the game would kick me out at sign-in instead of give me the character screen, with some error, because the wine package didn't automatically update my gnutls libs too

2016-04-13 01:37:15	gnarface	if the *launcher* doesn't work for you either... i wonder if maybe you have some winetricks still in your wineprefix from an earlier wine version that may now be in conflict?
2016-04-13 01:37:20	gnarface	stqn: ^^
2016-04-13 01:37:52	ky0	why not use playonlinux? so easy to manage everything
2016-04-13 01:38:11	stqn	I don’t understand playonlinux

2016-04-13 01:38:45	ky0	odd, for me everything works perfectly
2016-04-13 01:39:01	ky0	and I have 3 different wine instances for my 3 games, so I can configure them seperatly
2016-04-13 01:39:50	stqn	I use a separate wineprefix per game, it’s a bit tedious to setup but usually works
2016-04-13 01:39:54	gnarface	mostly separate prefixes with individual winetricks has been working for me too
2016-04-13 01:40:58	Spl-it	yeah seperate prefices with home made scripts beats playonlinux anytime

2016-04-13 02:17:13	stqn	I’ve been "trying" to do something for the lowrezjam (make a game in 64×64 pixels)
2016-04-13 02:17:13	Smilex	stqn: then just do something uninspired, like a Kingdom clone
2016-04-13 02:17:17	stqn	eheh
2016-04-13 02:17:18	Smilex	or something less complicated
2016-04-13 02:17:26	stqn	It’s actually in my list of ideas :D
2016-04-13 02:17:29	gnarface	stqn: you can just copy/move the program directory to a new prefix, probably
2016-04-13 02:17:32	Smilex	lowrezjam sounds interesting
2016-04-13 02:17:43	stqn	but I can’t draw so making a Kingdom clone would be difficult.
2016-04-13 02:18:39	stqn	I was thinking about an old-school racing game

2016-04-13 02:19:57	stqn	gnarface: that’s an idea, thanks… do you think it’s better to install it in 32 or 64 bit?

2016-04-13 04:42:40	mirv_	makes me wonder about SteamOS, if they'll allow other stores on there
2016-04-13 04:42:40		[04:42]
2016-04-13 04:43:05	mirv_	and by "allow", I mean as an option accessible, somehow, from the main interface
2016-04-13 04:44:51	@NaughtySquid	wow
2016-04-13 04:44:58	@NaughtySquid	zero Linux releases on Steam today
2016-04-13 04:45:02	@NaughtySquid	that hasn't happened for a while

2016-04-13 04:51:50	@NaughtySquid	if it's release day, where are the releases :P
2016-04-13 04:52:19	tadzik	emm
2016-04-13 04:52:26	tadzik	it's only 20:53!
2016-04-13 04:52:43	tadzik	anyway, I'm not surprised valve shot down itch
2016-04-13 04:52:57	tadzik	I still think their attempt to get on steam was like an april fools joke
2016-04-13 04:53:00	@Samsai	normally a shop doesn't allow a shop within it
2016-04-13 04:55:01	xpander69	itch.io pulled a great marketing trick :D
2016-04-13 04:55:07	xpander69	it will be talked about everywhere now
2016-04-13 04:57:27	tadzik	I think the only people who even raised an eyebrow at it are those that already knew itch :)

2016-04-13 05:08:33	mirv_	in its current state, amdgpu-pro is no better than fglrx
2016-04-13 05:11:03	calexil	not in my testing
2016-04-13 05:11:15	calexil	it was ~20 faster
2016-04-13 05:11:18	mirv_	strictly speaking, they've modified various libs and only distributed them in compiled form as well I think
2016-04-13 05:11:40	mirv_	but that will depend if all of mesa-related is GPL, or something else, as to if it's a problem
2016-04-13 05:12:14	mirv_	calexil, somehow I doubt that
2016-04-13 05:12:35	mirv_	do you mean 20x, or 20fps, or 20us?
2016-04-13 05:12:50	calexil	~20% better fps in benchmarks
2016-04-13 05:13:05	mirv_	I find that...dubious
2016-04-13 05:13:20	mirv_	regardless, it's still no better than fglrx
2016-04-13 05:13:37	mirv_	you still need blobs from amd to use it at all levels (right now)
2016-04-13 05:13:40	calexil	dubious or not, the numbers dont lie

2016-04-13 05:14:49	mirv_	there's a kernel change in those numbers I see
2016-04-13 05:15:51	mirv_	and, as I keep mentioning, you need blob libs from AMD - this includes parts of the graphics stack that are supposed to be "open"
2016-04-13 05:16:32	mirv_	so don't trust those numbers until it works with unmodified libs from the normal stack
2016-04-13 05:16:34	calexil	1 sec
2016-04-13 05:16:44	calexil	fglrx + kernel 4.4=no go
2016-04-13 05:17:00	calexil	amdgpu-pro wants 4.2+
2016-04-13 05:17:04	calexil	so...
2016-04-13 05:17:20	calexil	I dont know what to say other than... yeah sure one test was on an older kernel
2016-04-13 05:17:25	calexil	but out of necessity
2016-04-13 05:17:25		[05:17]
2016-04-13 05:19:12	mirv_	have you compared those numbers to Mesa?
2016-04-13 05:20:03	mirv_	it could be as simple a thing as the microcode being updated compared to what sat in fglrx

2016-04-13 05:35:02	@NaughtySquid	how?
2016-04-13 05:36:04	@Samsai	NaughtySquid, just browse the data files and see if some of the files have a weird owner or lack read permissions
2016-04-13 05:36:23	@Samsai	the error seems to be tied to a PNG reading subroutine
2016-04-13 05:36:24	@NaughtySquid	there's lots of files in various folders

2016-04-13 08:00:20	BTRE	well, mirv_ or anyone else who cares about radeonsi - it's got full ogl 4.2 support now and is just missing compute shaders on 4.3

2016-04-13 08:08:36	mirv_	though I don't have an r600 card anymore, I still care about that

2016-04-13 08:11:27	DrMcCoy	Nearly
2016-04-13 08:11:29	tadzik	that's the reason I stopped playing it :/
2016-04-13 08:11:56	tadzik	there's a bug reported on steam community, but devs don't give a shit
2016-04-13 08:12:41	DrMcCoy	Doesn't help that the save/load dialog is getting slower and slower the more save files there are
2016-04-13 08:12:57	DrMcCoy	The original Shadowrun Returns already had that problem
2016-04-13 08:13:31	DrMcCoy	So I am already "conserving" save slots
