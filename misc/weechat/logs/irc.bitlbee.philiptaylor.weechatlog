2016-03-30 13:33:54	fsociety	on saying that, they are making a taken tv series - unfortunately its like a precursor to the main character. so no one is being taken

2016-03-30 14:01:51	PhilipTaylor	512gb f ram sounds nice
2016-03-30 14:02:01	fsociety	i will say this about 32gb of ram - make sure your mobo likes to play friendly with that much ram. some mobos can be a bit buggy
2016-03-30 14:02:04	fsociety	so i'd do some research
2016-03-30 14:02:59	PhilipTaylor	least tick has the same writer... still interested to see where they take it
2016-03-30 14:03:17	fsociety	i predict you'll last two episodes
2016-03-30 14:03:41	fsociety	i just read the reviews for batman v superman... ouch
2016-03-30 14:03:43	PhilipTaylor	well they're only doing a pilot at this stage still, so one might be all we get hehe
2016-03-30 14:03:49	fsociety	i thought it wouldn't be great, but hahaha...
2016-03-30 14:08:36	PhilipTaylor	dangit I was really looking forward to seeing him as the tick again
2016-03-30 14:08:39	PhilipTaylor	:-(
2016-03-30 14:08:50	fsociety	sorry to ruin your day.. woops

2016-03-30 14:09:39	fsociety	i was pretty pissed when david hayter wasn't in the new metal gear solid game
2016-03-30 14:09:48	fsociety	to the point i can say i dislike the game quite a lot
2016-03-30 14:10:00	fsociety	and i'm a metal gear solid fanboy
2016-03-30 14:10:13	fsociety	but remove a long standing actor from something and it just doesn't feel the same
2016-03-30 14:14:40	PhilipTaylor	did he play snake?
2016-03-30 14:15:11	fsociety	correct
2016-03-30 14:15:32	fsociety	then was an article posted in the last day or so saying he would never work with hideo kojima ever again
2016-03-30 14:15:40	PhilipTaylor	it was fun having ssnake in smash bros.. such a weird place for him too ewnd up
2016-03-30 14:15:53	fsociety	it was all due to metal gear twin snakes
2016-03-30 14:16:02	fsociety	the remake of mgs1 on the gc
2016-03-30 14:16:09	fsociety	which i have yet to complete
2016-03-30 14:16:17	fsociety	runs fine on dolphin with widescreen hacks
2016-03-30 14:17:09	fsociety	i'd use the dolphin emu a lot more if there were more decent games. haha
2016-03-30 14:17:27	PhilipTaylor	heheh nice  =) dolphin rocks, prob the best emu I've used
2016-03-30 14:17:27	PhilipTaylor

2016-03-30 14:27:50	fsociety	i played starfox a bit, metroid was never huge into
2016-03-30 14:28:08	fsociety	my biggest issue with nintendo games is the lack thereof regarding plot and story
2016-03-30 14:29:24	fsociety	guessing you watched trailer park boys it came out on monday

2016-03-30 15:17:18	fsociety	haha just a tad
2016-03-30 15:17:40	fsociety	everybody who would want to watch the show would already have it
2016-03-30 15:17:52	fsociety	only reason being is look at the demographic the show is targetted to
2016-03-30 15:17:53	fsociety	haha
2016-03-30 15:18:19	PhilipTaylor	heheh exactly what I was thinking!

2016-04-11 13:11:09	PhilipTaylor	Man ue4 is fun... u so gotta get into it with us... there's so much more I can show you now - it's quite easy to make all kinds of shit happen... I find it as much fun as playing actual games
2016-04-11 13:33:13	fsociety	i think you find it as fun because you are good at 3d. where as i dont draw
2016-04-11 13:33:13		[13:33]
2016-04-11 13:33:49	fsociety	so all my concepts in my head always require to delve into 3d creation. and personally i have no interest in it "learning to make 3d models".
2016-04-11 13:39:00		[13:33]
2016-04-11 15:44:41	PhilipTaylor	lol I can understand that.. tho just making the engine do stuff is hella fun.. last night I just ran around shooting physics balls into piles until the engine crashed heheh

2016-04-11 15:46:45	fsociety	all i've been doing today is reading a thesis on the xeno-series of games. its taken me nearly all day to read it. i knew this xeno series of games was complicated, but this just put it in a whole new ballpark
