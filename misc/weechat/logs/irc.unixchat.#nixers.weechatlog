2016-01-20 23:06:37	mort_	soeh
2016-01-21 00:09:21	mort_	what do you do when you did `usermod -G somegroup username`, forgetting the -a, so that you're not part of the sudo group anymore and don't have a root password
2016-01-21 00:11:46	mort_	anyone there?
2016-01-21 00:12:07	venam	mort_: not sure
2016-01-21 00:12:14	venam	you overwrite all the groups
2016-01-21 00:12:26	venam	I think that's not valid until next login, no?
2016-01-21 00:13:23	mort_	mhm, but I relogged, because I wanted the new group
2016-01-21 00:14:47	mort_	including restarting tmux
2016-01-21 00:15:21	mort_	if I'm lucky, I'm logged in at a tty at home

2016-01-21 00:18:18	venam	or you can't?
2016-01-21 00:18:22	venam	VPS?
2016-01-21 00:18:56	mort_	it's my own physical server
2016-01-21 00:19:02	mort_	I could email myself, but that wouldn't really helep
2016-01-21 00:19:44	mort_	there's probably a root user there, but I can't recall the password; there's years since I installed the OS, and I've just used `sudo su` to get root
2016-01-21 00:21:20	venam	mort_: that's lame
2016-01-21 00:21:28	venam	do you have another user?
2016-01-21 00:21:41	venam	you could still boot from a cd and add yourself to the sudoer file
2016-01-21 00:21:43	venam	I think so
2016-01-21 00:21:57	venam	not sure of the procedure
2016-01-21 00:24:40	mort_	there is another user; didn't remember the password to that either (always just done `sudo su <user>`), but got it after a couple of tries just now
2016-01-21 00:24:48	mort_	and it has sudo access, so yay :)
2016-01-21 01:06:32	seth	mort_: this is why I do everything as root :P
2016-01-21 01:06:44	seth	I've been bitten by usermod before
2016-01-21 01:15:14	mort_	making usermod -G default to deleting all your groups sounds like a footgun
2016-01-21 01:24:55	seth	just edit /etc/gshadow directly :P

2016-01-21 02:44:57	dami	failing that, boot a live distro and chroot

2016-01-21 11:17:04	neeasade	now 
2016-01-21 11:17:09	neeasade	the dangerous/tricky part
2016-01-21 11:17:15	neeasade	is if dealing with signed vars/ints
2016-01-21 11:17:25	neeasade	because if the 1 ends up on the left, it's negative ofc.

2016-01-21 11:17:47	neeasade	paul: it shifts bits, but the values that enter are 0's
2016-01-21 11:17:56	paul	not when shifting right :p
2016-01-21 11:17:57	adam	but what variable type do you usually use when dealing with them?
2016-01-21 11:18:11	neeasade	adam: typically ints
2016-01-21 11:18:15	neeasade	but it's been a year
2016-01-21 11:18:17	neeasade	so iirc.
2016-01-21 11:18:28	paul	depending on the language handles data types
2016-01-21 11:18:37	paul	                ^how
2016-01-21 11:19:08	paul	signedness matters when you get above a really big number
2016-01-21 11:19:15	neeasade	yes.

2016-01-21 13:14:24	arc	wmutils was what really tought me how to script properly
2016-01-21 13:15:13	fsociety	you could even try and write your scripts in C instead of bash, that would be an interesting task regarding wmutils
2016-01-21 13:15:21	arc	thing is
2016-01-21 13:15:37	arc	at that point you'd be running a WM using wmutils as a backend with a boatload of system() calls
2016-01-21 13:15:41	arc	not wmutils
2016-01-21 13:16:06	fsociety	i've seen a few python projects that use wmutils as its backend
2016-01-21 13:16:15	arc	that would be something interesting, yes
2016-01-21 13:16:21	arc	for larger scripts I usually use python
2016-01-21 13:16:26	arc	but that's rare

2016-01-21 13:47:46	adam	THREE HOUR
2016-01-21 13:47:46	rocx	Heh. 'Cause no one wants class on Saturdays.
2016-01-21 13:47:48	adam	SAT MORNING
2016-01-21 13:47:50	adam	WHAT THE FUCK
2016-01-21 13:47:58	rocx	To be fair it was the only one I could get at the time.
2016-01-21 13:48:27	adam	i couldve gotten the 1 pm java class and not have class until like, well, 1
2016-01-21 13:48:30	adam	but nope
2016-01-21 13:48:41	adam	registered too late for that cause freshmen are fuckin losers
2016-01-21 13:49:09	rocx	Heck, too many of my other classes don't fit into other things so I'm practically a sophomore.
2016-01-21 13:49:18	rocx	I don't want to be too late to the HOPE once I bring my GPA up.
2016-01-21 13:53:42	rocx	And I probably shouldn't be in this class since it replaced another one that I got transfer credit for.
2016-01-21 13:54:06	rocx	And looooood help me once precalc, calc, and discrete comes into the picture.
2016-01-21 13:54:36	adam	calculus is easier than discrete
2016-01-21 13:54:38	adam	so much easier
2016-01-21 13:54:43	rocx	Not going to disagree.
2016-01-21 13:54:52	adam	but discrete is more interesting
2016-01-21 13:54:54	adam	at least to me
2016-01-21 13:55:10	rocx	Just got a ton of stuff I also need to take like three credhours of some phys-ed classes, management, and more.
2016-01-21 13:55:21	rocx	And then there's the option of minoring in English.
2016-01-21 13:55:22	adam	because calculus analyzes the known, unless you're dealing with indefiniate problems
2016-01-21 13:55:32	adam	discrete analyzes the unknown/possible
2016-01-21 13:55:34	rocx	Discrete's one of those things I heard benefits CS.
2016-01-21 13:55:37	adam	it does
2016-01-21 13:55:39	adam	a shit tone
2016-01-21 13:55:43	adam	its also hard as fuck
2016-01-21 13:55:57	rocx	Heck I still can't truly grasp pointers.
2016-01-21 13:56:02	adam	im thinking of switching my math minor into an eng minor
2016-01-21 13:56:06	rocx	Maybe save for scanf which uses addresses as arguments.
2016-01-21 13:56:08	adam	i enjoy writing stories a lot
2016-01-21 13:56:20	rocx	I still need to do my dumb comic.
2016-01-21 13:56:29	rocx	Wonder if a book with a ton of pictures would still qualify.
2016-01-21 13:56:34	@fro	heh
2016-01-21 14:14:03	rocx	If there's one thing you have to hand internet radio, they've got more modern stuff than the twenty/thirty year old swill they're still chugging.
2016-01-21 14:14:20	rocx	*the swill they're chugging on FM radio
2016-01-21 14:15:50	rocx	It's going to be 2056 and they'll still act like Bob Seger is still relevant.
2016-01-21 14:18:26	adam	im not gonna sugar coat it
2016-01-21 14:18:37	adam	i prefer file io in c in comparison with java
2016-01-21 14:18:47	adam	ive got like 12 different objects
2016-01-21 14:18:53	adam	in c u just read that shit
2016-01-21 14:19:06	rocx	Even then, I still work with streams/stdin/stdout as opposed to files more.
2016-01-21 14:19:15	adam	dont get me wrong im beginning to respect java a bin
2016-01-21 14:19:17	adam	bit
2016-01-21 14:19:22	rocx	I still don't.
2016-01-21 14:19:27	adam	which just confirms my ignorance
2016-01-21 14:19:29	adam	but fuck this
2016-01-21 14:19:32	rocx	The only thing resembling Getopt is a GNU thing.
2016-01-21 14:19:46	adam	bro i messed with getopt/getopt_long a few years ago
2016-01-21 14:19:47	rocx	I mean sure I just whittled a second assignment using exceptions.
2016-01-21 14:20:07	adam	i still havent looked at ARGBEGIN/ARGEND though
2016-01-21 14:20:17	adam	which is what the BSD's/Plan 9 use i think
2016-01-21 14:20:21	adam	im assuming those are macros
2016-01-21 14:20:24	rocx	Plan 9's.
2016-01-21 14:20:34	rocx	It's a set of macros for handling arguments.
2016-01-21 14:21:04	rocx	Well, 20h's more-widespread version is based on Plan 9's similar concept.
2016-01-21 14:21:50	adam	20h?
2016-01-21 14:22:01	rocx	One of the cat-v guys.
2016-01-21 14:22:04	adam	ah
2016-01-21 14:22:13	adam	didnt suckless implement that too?
2016-01-21 14:22:17	rocx	They worship the machines Plan 9's been ran on, so there's no surprise.
2016-01-21 14:22:24	rocx	adam: Wouldn't be surprised. It's a simple thing to toss in.
2016-01-21 14:22:40	rocx	Just #include "arg.h", ARGBEGIN { with cases, } ARGEND.
2016-01-21 14:22:54	rocx	getopt(3) is more standardized but a little more confusing.
2016-01-21 14:27:12	rocx	Piss. It would've been cool to be able to use the local hostname instead of localhost for local servers.
2016-01-21 14:27:26	rocx	gopher://lappy-486 sounds sweet for testing.
2016-01-21 14:28:51	adam	i mean you can still do that
2016-01-21 14:30:22	adam	wouldnt that just be a line /etc/hosts?
2016-01-21 14:30:28	*	rocx shrugs.
2016-01-21 14:30:31	adam	or am i thinking of a world too perfect for us
2016-01-21 14:31:27	rocx	Tell you one thing, adam, on Java, that when you use the new line opening brace style like you would for C, it looks really alien on Java.
2016-01-21 14:32:03	rocx	Perfectly natural in C. WTF in Java.
2016-01-21 14:32:20	adam	i mean thats true for a lot of stuff
2016-01-21 14:32:25	adam	vim likes to double tab for indent
2016-01-21 14:32:28	adam	is that the norm?
2016-01-21 14:32:39	rocx	How big is a tab? 4char or 8chat?
2016-01-21 14:32:44	adam	ill always consider java as inferior to the powah of C but meh
2016-01-21 14:32:49	adam	4 char
2016-01-21 14:32:53	rocx	Then that's why.
2016-01-21 14:32:54	adam	id assume thats editor specific
2016-01-21 14:33:01	adam	wait tabs are 8 char in java?
2016-01-21 14:33:02	rocx	Yeah. That's the argument of tabs.
2016-01-21 14:33:16	adam	cause in C/bash/anything else its only 4char
2016-01-21 14:34:36	rocx	I (try) to go for spaces because 1) it forces a style on a simple text editor and 2) You should be using a big boy's editor if you plan on editing that code. One that can take care of those pesky indents.
2016-01-21 14:34:48	rocx	Inferior editors like Vim, Sublime Text, and Atom probably can.
2016-01-21 14:35:30	adam	i dont wanna use eclipse
2016-01-21 14:35:32	adam	pls
2016-01-21 14:35:41	rocx	I don't.
2016-01-21 14:35:43	adam	for the record
2016-01-21 14:35:50	adam	for the record my vim plugins do catch syntax errors
2016-01-21 14:36:08	rocx	Good then. It's probably a hackjob like Vimscript is but eh whatever.
2016-01-21 14:36:31	adam	vim's existence is a hackjob
2016-01-21 14:37:14	rocx	Neovim seems like it's going to crank the hackiness to "correct" enterprisey eleven.
2016-01-21 14:37:20	rocx	It even throws in a terminal emulator.
2016-01-21 14:37:42	rocx	Just for a plain text editor?
2016-01-21 14:37:43	adam	its got async plus plausible lua scripting support
2016-01-21 14:37:44	adam	ill take it
2016-01-21 14:37:45	rocx	Like really.
2016-01-21 14:38:08	adam	i mean we could go to the obvious end-all-be-all editor
2016-01-21 14:38:10	adam	...
2016-01-21 14:38:16	*	adam clears his throat
2016-01-21 14:38:17	fsociety	don't mention the "e" word
2016-01-21 14:38:22	rocx	Come on. You know the right words.
2016-01-21 14:38:34	adam	ACMEACMEACMEACMEACMAECMAMCMEAMCAEMCMEAMCMAEMCMAECM
2016-01-21 14:38:35	rocx	THERE IT IS!

2016-01-21 14:38:42	*	rocx blows open a party ball.
2016-01-21 14:38:53	rocx	fsociety: Acme, mang! Mang, acme!
2016-01-21 14:38:57	adam	YAY!
2016-01-21 14:39:02	 < 	feute (feute@Clk-F6D99A2.genericrev.cantv.net) has quit (feute)
2016-01-21 14:39:09	adam	fun fact, u can have a shell in an acme window
2016-01-21 14:39:14	adam	but heres the thing motherfuckers
2016-01-21 14:39:21	adam	its just an rc script that redirs i/o

2016-01-21 14:40:07	*	fsociety has to figure out what the theme song would be
2016-01-21 14:40:08	adam	Walkin fast
2016-01-21 14:40:19	adam	a thousand miles by vanessa carlton
2016-01-21 14:40:27	adam	that will be played at my funeral
2016-01-21 14:40:31	adam	no question
2016-01-21 14:40:50	fsociety	i'd request extreme grind core at my funeral just to annoy everyone
2016-01-21 14:41:14	fsociety	no funeral should be without blast beats ;)
2016-01-21 14:41:15	adam	Always Look on the Bright Side of Life
2016-01-21 14:41:24	rocx	dcat: We require your nation's top grindcore for fsociety's funeral.
2016-01-21 14:41:27	adam	with the greatest singer of our time Eric Idle
2016-01-21 14:41:43	rocx	Which should be in about...
2016-01-21 14:41:45	rocx	...Ten minutes.
2016-01-21 14:42:11	rocx	fsociety: Yeah I made the mistake of serving canned tuna to ya'll.
2016-01-21 14:42:17	adam	last i heard dcat he was thinkin about fucking jmbi's mom
2016-01-21 14:42:38	adam	oh shit now they're both gonna get me
2016-01-21 14:42:53	fsociety	rocx: hahahaha. ijust imagine someone doing a speech over grindcore
2016-01-21 14:42:59	fsociety	the thought just makes me laugh
2016-01-21 14:43:36	rocx	"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to..." (volume cranks up) "BLOOD ON STONE; HOLY PRIEST; NO ESCAPE; NO RELEASE; SACRIFIIIIIIIIIICE!"
2016-01-21 14:43:54	fsociety	or i request everyone do their speeches in black metal stylings
2016-01-21 14:44:12	rocx	fsociety: Okay I cheated that was traditional not black/grind.
2016-01-21 14:44:12	fsociety	screams "HE WILL BE SORELY MISSSEDDD.... IIIINN HEEELLLLLL *GUTTERAL SCREAM*
2016-01-21 14:45:18	*	rocx has a go at the guttural screaming and fails. He's gonna go get a cup of water now.
2016-01-21 14:45:49	fsociety	hahaha. i practice my gutterals while i drive to work. 
2016-01-21 14:46:16	rocx	Eh. Don't know why that black/grind/viking stuff became popular.
2016-01-21 14:46:44	rocx	It's like metal went from big hair and motorcycles to sacrifices to Lucifer in concerts and strumming at a gorillion BPM.
2016-01-21 14:47:02	fsociety	haha everything has its niche
2016-01-21 14:47:04	*	rocx tapes a wig to his head.
2016-01-21 14:47:06	fsociety	look at linux ;)
2016-01-21 14:47:38	rocx	Even the "elite" here will call Linux users DIRTY PEASANTS! from the BSD high horse.
2016-01-21 14:47:41	fsociety	personally i prefer my prog metal
2016-01-21 14:47:44	rocx	Kind of like BSD too.
2016-01-21 14:48:07	adam	rocx u still on void
2016-01-21 14:48:13	rocx	Sadly.
2016-01-21 14:48:17	adam	nooooooo

2016-01-21 14:48:34	fsociety	currently on funtoo
2016-01-21 14:48:35	rocx	I've been fed up with how XBPS breaks.
2016-01-21 14:48:57	fsociety	void is just a bit too young for my liking
2016-01-21 14:49:01	fsociety	i prefer MILF linux distros
2016-01-21 14:49:05	adam	hah
2016-01-21 14:49:13	rocx	Slackware?
2016-01-21 14:49:38	rocx	Debian?
2016-01-21 14:49:41	fsociety	i'd say slackware, but i like some dependency help
2016-01-21 14:49:54	fsociety	well im currently on a gentoo-based distro.. so
2016-01-21 14:50:01	rocx	If Void breaks, I'm either going FreeBSD or Funtoo.
2016-01-21 14:50:09	fsociety	yeah im funtoo
2016-01-21 14:50:15	fsociety	its gentoo without all the breakages
2016-01-21 14:50:24	adam	i also heard it's pretty...
2016-01-21 14:50:25	adam	...

2016-01-21 14:51:12	fsociety	it then responds
2016-01-21 14:51:14	fsociety	"fuck off"
2016-01-21 14:51:15	rocx	And sudo insults you by default.
2016-01-21 14:51:24	rocx	It is on oBSD.
2016-01-21 14:51:27	adam	u dont 'ave prim n proper privliges you filthy wankah
2016-01-21 14:51:30	fsociety	or it installs the total opposite of what you want

2016-01-21 14:51:49	Wildefyr	fsociety : why not just try crux?

2016-01-21 14:53:42	fsociety	rocx: haha.. as part of the sign up you have to choose your favourite distro, shell and desktop environment and wear a badge
2016-01-21 14:53:42	rocx	Or "ARCH MASTER RACE GET OUT OF HERE UBUNTU LOSERS".
2016-01-21 14:53:49	rocx	fV:

2016-01-21 14:54:03	fsociety	so everyone knows what you are currently using
2016-01-21 14:54:13	fsociety	and jono bacon is doing the key note i think
2016-01-21 14:54:13	Wildefyr	but then I wanto go to it so I can be like
2016-01-21 14:54:17	rocx	What if I use BSD and am just here for the tech news?

2016-01-21 14:54:56	Wildefyr	even wmutils is only one part of my desktop now :)
2016-01-21 14:55:05	fsociety	Wildefyr: what are the other parts
2016-01-21 14:55:28	Wildefyr	lemonbar dmenu and a bunch of shell scripts
2016-01-21 14:55:42	Wildefyr	I also make heavily use of stuff like xprop xinput
2016-01-21 14:55:42	fsociety	i looked at rofi but i went back to dmneu2

2016-01-21 14:55:59	Wildefyr	a couple of other suckless tools to boot as well
2016-01-21 14:56:35	fsociety	i went back to bspwm only cause i like its tiling mechanism.. i thought about trying to integrate that into wmutils.. but i was too lazy
2016-01-21 14:57:02	fsociety	my other idea was to make a wrapper for wmutils in python or c++ for easy configuration
2016-01-21 14:57:22	rocx	adam: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine
2016-01-21 14:57:29	Wildefyr	yeah that'd be cool
2016-01-21 14:57:38	rocx	We might finally have nine planets again!
2016-01-21 14:57:39	Wildefyr	wmutils is just a framework anyway
2016-01-21 14:57:46	fsociety	Wildefyr: exactly
2016-01-21 14:57:55	Wildefyr	fyre could be alot more automatic
2016-01-21 14:58:16	fsociety	so you could make the wrapper modular.. by adding in plugins and new scripts with relative ease
2016-01-21 14:58:21	Wildefyr	but I encourage people to clone and then syslink the scripts somewhere on their path and create their own fork
2016-01-21 14:58:27	fsociety	and people could contribute that way
2016-01-21 14:58:53	Wildefyr	that'd be interesting but not for me I feel like
2016-01-21 14:59:05	fsociety	Wildefyr: your scripts made me understand wmutils at least :)
2016-01-21 14:59:10	fsociety	And yeah, definetly not for you
2016-01-21 14:59:27	Wildefyr	wmutils is the purest form of a window manager you can get
2016-01-21 14:59:49	Wildefyr	thanks bro
2016-01-21 14:59:57	fsociety	i'll let you on a little secret Wildefyr.  I still use wmutils on my work machine :)
2016-01-21 15:00:06	Wildefyr	I still wanna look into tiling with binary tree
2016-01-21 15:00:08	Wildefyr	s
2016-01-21 15:00:10	Wildefyr	!!!
2016-01-21 15:00:15	Wildefyr	fsociety : naughty boy
2016-01-21 15:00:27	Wildefyr	but isn't it just the best!
2016-01-21 15:00:28	fsociety	if you can get tiling with binary tree in wmutils efficient. then boom - back on wmutils
2016-01-21 15:00:51	fsociety	its just fun to have that much control, been tempted to see how well wmutils integrates with bspwm
2016-01-21 15:00:54	Wildefyr	yh will probably have to actually learn C to do it efficiently
2016-01-21 15:01:36	fsociety	or steal bspwm code
2016-01-21 15:01:36	fsociety	haha
2016-01-21 15:02:05	Wildefyr	yeah I just don't know the theory behind it
2016-01-21 15:02:18	Wildefyr	once I know that I can probably write something myself
2016-01-21 15:02:30	adam	Planet Nine
2016-01-21 15:02:32	adam	might as well call it
2016-01-21 15:02:39	adam	im not gonna put u guys through this

2016-01-21 21:04:54	venam	they have an insane software that analyses memor and give 3D visualization

2016-01-22 02:09:05	adam	maybe im too oldschool for this new fangled world
2016-01-22 02:09:06	kirby	All I really want is double borders, might just patch dwm
2016-01-22 02:09:18	@xero	yh, the usb ethernet adapter is stupid slow

2016-01-22 03:23:40	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : or you know, could just use mpv for everything
2016-01-22 03:24:03	Wildefyr	instead of using a million different programs for very similar media
2016-01-22 03:25:22	@xero	meow

2016-01-22 03:26:57	Pr0Wolf29	mpv disappeats after the gif plays
2016-01-22 03:27:01	Wildefyr	what *don't* you agree with?
2016-01-22 03:27:11	seth	new macs have a 3.5mm jack
2016-01-22 03:27:18	Wildefyr	use --loop-file Pr0Wolf29 
2016-01-22 03:27:18	seth	1 usb C, 1 3.5mm
2016-01-22 03:27:24	Wildefyr	or -loop for a playlist
2016-01-22 03:27:35	adam	oh shit we have 3 members
2016-01-22 03:27:37	Pr0Wolf29	okay what if I don't want it to loop. What if I want it to just stay there?
2016-01-22 03:27:43	@xero	i like mpd
2016-01-22 03:27:48	@xero	and ncmpcpp
2016-01-22 03:27:56	seth	>2016
2016-01-22 03:27:58	Wildefyr	? what do you mean
2016-01-22 03:28:10	seth	>using media-playing software on the desktop
2016-01-22 03:28:16	Wildefyr	you can pause it like anyother video
2016-01-22 03:28:19	Pr0Wolf29	I want it to just stay open and do nothing after playing
2016-01-22 03:28:33	adam	nothing beats a nice solid music library on a good ol' fashioned hard drive
2016-01-22 03:28:37	adam	i mean why else does bit torrent exist
2016-01-22 03:28:41	@xero	adam++
2016-01-22 03:28:45	Pr0Wolf29	I'm going to need an image viewer anyways for sorting through the files.
2016-01-22 03:28:45	Wildefyr	lol why would you want that
2016-01-22 03:28:50	Pr0Wolf29	Because it's nice.
2016-01-22 03:28:52	seth	except, you know, then you have to manage your library
2016-01-22 03:28:56	Wildefyr	gifs always loop lol
2016-01-22 03:29:05	@xero	>manage your library
2016-01-22 03:29:10	adam	not that hard
2016-01-22 03:29:14	Wildefyr	even mpv exits when you reach the end of a file on a video
2016-01-22 03:29:14	@xero	you make cp from to ?
2016-01-22 03:29:16	seth	yeah man, I used to rename files based on tags
2016-01-22 03:29:18	adam	not really sure what that even means
2016-01-22 03:29:25	seth	make sure there's albumart.jpg in each album
2016-01-22 03:29:28	seth	organize by year
2016-01-22 03:29:43	adam	ah well im not extremely draconian so i dont mind much
2016-01-22 03:29:53	Pr0Wolf29	Considering the fact I've advocated using mpv as a replacement for a music player, I'm surprised people are telling me of all people I'm not using mpv enough.
2016-01-22 03:30:02	@xero	seth: beets does all that for me if i need it
2016-01-22 03:30:11	seth	my structure was /music/[A-Z]/Artist/(YYYY) Album/## - title.mp3
2016-01-22 03:30:16	seth	gotta be consistent
2016-01-22 03:30:22	*	xero skoffs
2016-01-22 03:30:37	seth	**only** mp3 v0 or 320
2016-01-22 03:30:42	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : i use mpv for everything
2016-01-22 03:30:45	adam	i order mine by filetype cause im a fucking hipster
2016-01-22 03:30:52	Wildefyr	if it's media mpv is the right tool
2016-01-22 03:30:55	adam	~/aio/flac
2016-01-22 03:30:59	adam	~/aio/mp3
2016-01-22 03:31:02	seth	ew
2016-01-22 03:31:05	adam	fuck you i use unix
2016-01-22 03:31:09	@xero	kekl
2016-01-22 03:31:10	seth	I'd rather find things by the artist
2016-01-22 03:31:17	seth	you know, organized into a catalog
2016-01-22 03:31:26	seth	I don't want to remember if I stole it in FLAC or MP3
2016-01-22 03:31:37	adam	i mean id organize artist after filetpye
2016-01-22 03:31:41	@xero	i just cue the playlist i want. (i have one for ever album / genera)
2016-01-22 03:31:47	Wildefyr	I just list by Artists/Complilations/Random/Soundtracks/Mixes
2016-01-22 03:31:50	adam	so id have ~/aio/flac/nujabes and then also ~/aio/mp3/nujabes
2016-01-22 03:31:53	adam	or somethin like that
2016-01-22 03:31:58	seth	what I'm trying to say is
2016-01-22 03:32:02	seth	google music is worth 9$ a month
2016-01-22 03:32:07	Wildefyr	pls
2016-01-22 03:32:10	Wildefyr	9$
2016-01-22 03:32:11	@xero	pls
2016-01-22 03:32:12	adam	BUT ITS NOT YOUR MUSIC
2016-01-22 03:32:16	seth	it is my music
2016-01-22 03:32:16	adam	YOU DONT HAVE IT
2016-01-22 03:32:16	Wildefyr	I'm broke nigger
2016-01-22 03:32:17	adam	i want it
2016-01-22 03:32:19	Wildefyr	I'm broke
2016-01-22 03:32:20	seth	yes you can
2016-01-22 03:32:21	Pr0Wolf29	No. mpv doesn't have features that make sorting images easy.
2016-01-22 03:32:24	seth	you can listen to it offline
2016-01-22 03:32:27	seth	on any device
2016-01-22 03:32:28	Wildefyr	Pr0Wolf29 : like?
2016-01-22 03:32:35	seth	you can upload 50,000 **of your own songs**
2016-01-22 03:32:35	adam	can you have the actual file
2016-01-22 03:32:36	@xero	still not users
2016-01-22 03:32:42	@xero	you're "renting" music that way
2016-01-22 03:32:46	Pr0Wolf29	Being able to copy the file name from mpv itself
2016-01-22 03:32:48	seth	if you haven't purchased it, the files are not available to you
2016-01-22 03:32:54	Wildefyr	??
2016-01-22 03:32:57	seth	but you can "pin" aka cache them
2016-01-22 03:32:58	adam	because there really is nothing that beats the flexibility of having each file to do what you want with
2016-01-22 03:32:59	Wildefyr	not sure why you need that
2016-01-22 03:33:13	seth	anything you purchase is yours to keep
2016-01-22 03:33:15	Wildefyr	if you're using coreutils whatever, file browser whatever
2016-01-22 03:33:21	seth	anything you add to library is available to listen to as long as you pay
2016-01-22 03:33:26	Pr0Wolf29	So I can add it to a jobilfe that'll move it to a folder I want when I'm done sorting my images.
2016-01-22 03:33:27	@xero	Wildefyr: i copy image file names alot from my viewer
2016-01-22 03:33:33	seth	anything you upload is available to listen to if you don't pay
2016-01-22 03:33:39	Wildefyr	meh
2016-01-22 03:33:47	@xero	when you're in a huge dir of randomly named files you're visually sorting though it's kinda important
2016-01-22 03:33:48	Pr0Wolf29	xero: What viewer you use?
2016-01-22 03:33:53	Pr0Wolf29	Yeah
2016-01-22 03:34:00	Wildefyr	you can always use my mpvc program
2016-01-22 03:34:12	@xero	feh (or viewnoir depending on use case)
2016-01-22 03:34:14	Wildefyr	it doesn't have formatting yet but you can pull the filename that way
2016-01-22 03:34:34	Wildefyr	there might be a way to bind a key in mpv though
2016-01-22 03:35:58	Wildefyr	well I asked in mpv
2016-01-22 03:36:05	Wildefyr	the devs are pretty active in there

2016-01-22 04:40:30	@xero	>bitching about terminal users
2016-01-22 04:40:56	rocx	i mean just use a simpler environment if you're going to do that.
2016-01-22 04:41:06	Wildefyr	er
2016-01-22 04:41:08	Wildefyr	yes?
2016-01-22 04:41:19	@xero	>terminal scrubs
2016-01-22 04:41:26	@xero	sounds like your talking shit to me
2016-01-22 04:41:34	rocx	no not like that. i still use a shell too.
2016-01-22 04:41:50	@xero	is there a gui emacs?
2016-01-22 04:41:56	@xero	like vim's ?
2016-01-22 04:42:07	Wildefyr	yeah
2016-01-22 04:42:22	rocx	an x11 one and a gtk2 one.
2016-01-22 04:42:50	rocx	all they really do is allow for more colors, a couple of other fancy things, and makes the menu bar (if you didn't inhibit it) clickable with a mouse.
2016-01-22 04:43:21	@xero	was just curious
2016-01-22 04:43:46	rocx	i just use the gtk one for the colors and the ability to have color themes change better when i load one ad-hoc.
2016-01-22 04:44:54	rocx	but i will give someone flak for using gvim as opposed to vim in a terminal.
2016-01-22 04:45:16	@xero	classic hypocrisy
2016-01-22 04:45:26	rocx	it keeps the world a turnin'.

2016-01-22 05:08:50	seth	the whole cluster in one template?
2016-01-22 05:09:12	seth	that's awesome though
2016-01-22 05:09:22	@xero	iirc that's what corey is working on now

2016-01-22 05:11:37	seth	it just makes life easier :)
2016-01-22 05:11:51	@z3bra	the purpose here is to test my new distro
2016-01-22 05:11:57	@z3bra	not to isolate an app
2016-01-22 05:12:49	@xero	vbox? or lxc?
2016-01-22 05:12:58	@xero	inb4 lxc
2016-01-22 05:13:13	@z3bra	I'm trying the "contain" app
2016-01-22 05:13:26	@z3bra	but yeah, I'll end up with lxc I guess

2016-01-22 05:40:18	@z3bra	gentoo's wiki is soooo much usefull than the arch one
2016-01-22 05:40:22	@z3bra	let's be honest here
2016-01-22 05:40:28	@z3bra	arch wiki sucks now
2016-01-22 05:40:37	@z3bra	it has become to systemd specific
2016-01-22 05:40:41	rocx	Indeed.
2016-01-22 05:41:26	@z3bra	i'm on crux > lxc doesn't work > go to gentoo wiki
2016-01-22 05:41:38	@z3bra	and now everything is specified, even the kernel options needed
2016-01-22 05:41:42	@z3bra	on arch?
2016-01-22 05:41:54	@z3bra	they explain which systemd file you need

2016-01-22 06:02:08	seth	I like the arch wiki. I guess it's aimed at people migrating from sysv to systemd, cause it's fine for me
2016-01-22 06:02:43	@xero	rocx: why does cgo show all the ^M ?

2016-01-22 06:03:01	@xero	nvm
2016-01-22 06:04:39	rocx	xero: Because it's raw and not put through a filter function yet.
2016-01-22 06:04:44	rocx	It's a learning process.
2016-01-22 06:05:53	seth	writing a lisp gopher client, rocx?
2016-01-22 06:06:23	rocx	Yeah.
2016-01-22 06:06:28	seth	that's pretty sweet
2016-01-22 06:06:39	seth	what's a "GET" request look like?

2016-01-22 06:06:59	@xero	;D
2016-01-22 06:07:03	rocx	As in a request for data?
2016-01-22 06:07:12	seth	HTTP is pretty simple, just send "GET /route HTTP\1.1" over TCP connection
2016-01-22 06:07:13	adam	does anyone know how to get pepperflash in chromium working manually

2016-01-22 06:07:17	adam	or am i just being dumb again
2016-01-22 06:07:26	seth	how are you specifying the route though?
2016-01-22 06:07:30	seth	or "route"
2016-01-22 06:07:58	seth	followed by \r\n\r\n
2016-01-22 06:07:59	@xero	adam: what's chrome://flash/
2016-01-22 06:08:02	*	rocx shrugs. The networking aspect's being done by the Lisp environment. He just calls to set up a stream connection.
2016-01-22 06:08:03	@xero	show you?
2016-01-22 06:08:24	adam	wha

2016-01-22 07:36:47	fro	http://www.oldschoolirc.com/scripts 
2016-01-22 07:36:56	fro	that one actually has a couple screenshots
2016-01-22 07:37:02	fro	like tunnelvision
2016-01-22 07:37:23	fro	http://www.oldschoolirc.com/images/tv.png 
2016-01-22 07:37:36	fro	because almost all of those are themes from old bitchx/epic scripts
2016-01-22 07:37:44	fro	or at least dudes that used to make them
2016-01-22 07:38:07	fro	but jircii sucks
2016-01-22 07:38:18	fro	i don't even want to try to load that up to see the themes
2016-01-22 07:38:19	fro	heh
2016-01-22 07:40:42	@xero	don't blame you there
2016-01-22 07:40:56	fro	there was this script called opal for mirc
2016-01-22 07:41:00	fro	such great themes
2016-01-22 07:41:06	fro	wish i still had that
2016-01-22 07:41:14	fro	i'd probably install linux + wine just to see those
2016-01-22 07:41:23	fro	and remake them for irssi or epic5
2016-01-22 07:42:07	@xero	remember "irc war scripts"
2016-01-22 07:42:07	@xero	lel
2016-01-22 07:42:11	fro	oh yeah
2016-01-22 07:42:17	@xero	ping nukes and udp flooders...
2016-01-22 07:42:19	fro	ice.bx
2016-01-22 07:42:28	fro	i miss those days too
2016-01-22 07:42:34	fro	when you could just winnuke someone
2016-01-22 07:42:44	@xero	oh, and we did ;D
2016-01-22 07:43:04	fro	things have spiraled into another direction these days
2016-01-22 07:43:13	fro	i appreciate that there's less of those exploits
2016-01-22 07:43:15	fro	but
2016-01-22 07:43:19	fro	that shit was fun
2016-01-22 07:43:28	fro	and now it's all about bandwidth too
2016-01-22 07:43:46	fro	can't even smurf now
2016-01-22 07:47:31	seth	I thought nowadays it's all death threats and ordering COD pizza to people's houses and SWAT'ing
2016-01-22 07:47:45	fro	it is i guess
2016-01-22 07:47:54	fro	that's worse heh
2016-01-22 07:48:06	seth	hivemind "groupthink" skiddie culture
2016-01-22 07:48:09	fro	i wouldn't do that to someone that i'd ddos honestly
2016-01-22 07:48:12	fro	that's too far imo
2016-01-22 07:48:26	@xero	yeah, i'd much rather get ping nuked off dial up, then a swat team at my door
2016-01-22 07:48:28	fro	you'd have to be a really terrible person for me to get personal like that
2016-01-22 07:48:34	seth	pretty much
2016-01-22 07:48:40	fro	that kinda stuff is ridiculous to me
2016-01-22 07:48:42	seth	it's that idiot 4chan groupthink bro culture
2016-01-22 07:48:58	seth	just migrated to twitch
2016-01-22 07:49:09	fro	and this is why i try to stay as anonymous as possible now
2016-01-22 07:49:09	seth	or maybe they hang out in /vg/ ?
2016-01-22 07:49:11	seth	I don't know
2016-01-22 07:49:14	seth	same here
2016-01-22 07:49:16	fro	because of these children
2016-01-22 07:49:20	fro	wild ass children
2016-01-22 07:49:24	fro	got no morals
2016-01-22 07:49:34	seth	'anonymous' as in this is my first name, but it's pretty uncommon :P
2016-01-22 07:49:35	paul	ass children? like, poop?
2016-01-22 07:49:38	fro	i would gladly take getting ddosed for weeks
2016-01-22 07:49:39	seth	pretty common**
2016-01-22 07:49:45	fro	but if you start fucking with my personal life
2016-01-22 07:49:49	fro	we're going to war
2016-01-22 07:50:13	seth	the thing about DDOS'ing someone's connection is that it's mostly DHCP anyway
2016-01-22 07:50:22	seth	you could just switch the mac address on the router and renew lease
2016-01-22 07:50:25	fro	ok
2016-01-22 07:50:28	fro	this thing is about to start
2016-01-22 07:50:33	fro	and people are reaidng over my shoulder

2016-01-22 08:16:59	fyr	it does!
2016-01-22 08:17:22	@z3bra	wmp 0 0 + wmp $x $y isn't that much of a showcase

2016-01-22 08:24:27	@z3bra	I just don't want this repo to have >50 scripts that use "more or less" wmutils

2016-01-24 10:38:50	arc	i know that
2016-01-24 10:38:56	henriqueleng	arc: not using glibc
2016-01-24 10:38:57	arc	i have various problems with gnu
2016-01-24 10:39:04	henriqueleng	sndio is nice too
2016-01-24 10:39:06	arc	henriqueleng: since when were you limited to glibc?
2016-01-24 10:39:13	arc	musl, uclibc exist
2016-01-24 10:39:24	fyr	I stick with gnu stuff because generally it 'werks' okay
2016-01-24 10:39:42	fyr	and I don't have the need to hipster enough to switch
2016-01-24 10:39:48	henriqueleng	arc: Yeah, on linux I almost only use musl, but support on BSD is bigger
2016-01-24 10:39:51	fyr	sure there is bloat but whatever
2016-01-24 10:40:03	fyr	they're small programs in comparision anyway generally
2016-01-24 10:40:32	fsociety	tbh, to become a good sys admin you have to become a master of the core gnu utils
2016-01-24 10:40:52	fsociety	cause that way no matter what unix variatian you use you have those tools at your disposal
2016-01-24 10:41:22	fyr	agreed
2016-01-24 10:41:26	henriqueleng	anyone here can solve a rubiks cube?

2016-01-24 10:42:16	fyr	but there is a pattern
2016-01-24 10:43:13	eldritch	I'm going to memorize an algorithm just to impress my peers with my ability to google shit, which some people confuse with being smart
2016-01-24 10:43:24	eldritch	It
2016-01-24 10:43:46	henriqueleng	Bought one yesterday, I'm really addicted to it
2016-01-24 10:44:27	henriqueleng	I'm just missing one algorithm to finish it
2016-01-24 10:45:11	henriqueleng	eldritch: True, rubiks cube is a lot of memorization
2016-01-24 10:50:35	rocx	eldritch: judging by how people can't seem to grasp the concept of superior search engines like ddg, no surprise people consider ability to search equal to smartness.
2016-01-24 10:50:57	adam	3 loads of laundry
2016-01-24 10:51:01	adam	suck it

2016-01-24 10:51:18	adam	to each their own then my friend
2016-01-24 10:51:21	eldritch	The only thing I don't like about ddg is how much of a PITA googling images on it is
2016-01-24 10:51:30	adam	!gi images query
2016-01-24 10:51:41	rocx	haven't had any issues there.
2016-01-24 10:51:42	eldritch	Also, I just referred to searching on a non-google search engine as googling. Language is weird.
2016-01-24 10:51:56	rocx	that's because people don't know of alternatives.
2016-01-24 10:52:16	rocx	and the majority that do refuse to acknowledge its superiority because they're loyal to the big g brand.
2016-01-24 10:52:31	eldritch	Google is full botnet. I don't trust them for a second.
2016-01-24 10:52:38	rocx	eldritch: wish more people agreed.

2016-01-24 10:55:41	arc	rocx: the hs i'm going to doesn't require you to have computers

2016-01-24 11:35:47	tm512	if you telnet or netcat into IRC, the format of received messages is like :nick!user@host privmsg #channel :stuff
2016-01-24 11:35:49	fro	it's chaos
2016-01-24 11:36:02	eldritch	I feel like trying to use ii just to lengthen my epeen
2016-01-24 11:36:09	dcat	that's correct tm512

2016-01-24 11:38:40	dcat	z3bra ?
2016-01-24 11:38:48	@z3bra	ok so far, I can boot a container, setup the network, git clone a repo, cd into it, and compile it by running "make"
2016-01-24 11:38:56	@z3bra	(using pcc, of course)
2016-01-24 11:39:09	@z3bra	(and statically)
2016-01-24 11:39:46	dcat	that's all fine and dandy
2016-01-24 11:39:53	dcat	but a more pressing matter is at hand
2016-01-24 11:40:00	dcat	you need to try `crawl`.
2016-01-24 11:40:06	@z3bra	what's thaT?
2016-01-24 11:40:08	adam	and appreciate dcat's work
2016-01-24 11:40:17	@z3bra	I like the name already
2016-01-24 11:40:24	dcat	awesome rougelike
2016-01-24 11:40:37	@z3bra	how do I play?
2016-01-24 11:40:49	adam	anyways im gonna check out this config just a heads up guys in case you wanted to know
2016-01-24 11:40:49	dcat	just  do the tutorial

2016-01-24 11:41:02	dcat	download it
2016-01-24 11:41:04	dcat	run crawl
2016-01-24 11:41:12	@z3bra	how do I download it?
2016-01-24 11:41:14	dcat	and use arrow keys to navigate to tutorial
2016-01-24 11:41:20	tm512	also, whether or not IRC bots are stereotypical or not is kind of irrelevant. you can't deny that writing one from scratch involves knowledge about the IRC protocol
2016-01-24 11:41:24	@z3bra	man you need to learn how to go straigh to the point
2016-01-24 11:41:28	@z3bra	:P
2016-01-24 11:41:42	rocx	tm512: unless you use ii.
2016-01-24 11:41:43	fro	tm512: you were still wrong
2016-01-24 11:41:47	fro	so none of this matters
2016-01-24 11:42:07	rocx	then you don't need to know jack squart about the protocol just sign it into your favorite networks and channels and unlesh the havoc.
2016-01-24 11:42:30	tm512	using ii would not be "from scratch"
2016-01-24 11:42:38	rocx	then use dcat's irc library.
2016-01-24 11:42:46	dcat	"library"
2016-01-24 11:42:47	dcat	lel
2016-01-24 11:42:56	rocx	yeah, using the term loosely.
2016-01-24 11:43:06	dcat	and rocx, you have to understand the protocol to use it
2016-01-24 11:43:11	rocx	oh.
2016-01-24 11:43:17	rocx	at least it's not a python crap.
2016-01-24 11:44:03	rocx	import ircbot ... iot = signIn("irc.iotek.org", "#nixers") ... iot.Say("heh")
2016-01-24 11:45:37	tm512	you guys just seemed to think I was bragging or trying to show off or something when I said that I had written an IRC bot before
2016-01-24 11:45:48	dcat	no no no
2016-01-24 11:45:49	tm512	I'm not saying that it's any big accomplishment or anything
2016-01-24 11:45:52	dcat	we're just fucking around

2016-01-24 11:50:31	fro	like how it looks when someone messages you
2016-01-24 11:50:43	tm512	it's just that it would be a hard script to fuck up

2016-01-24 11:51:38	tm512	all it's doing is "<nick> message", so it spitting out what looked like it could be part of an IRC protocol message, threw me off

2016-01-24 15:30:33	@fro	something incredibly generic

2016-01-25 20:39:16	Roonix	lol I'm the same, I put everything off until the last possible minute :D
2016-01-25 20:39:22	thang1	it always backfires on me
2016-01-25 20:39:32	thang1	I have a really huge programming assignment due for artificial intelligence
2016-01-25 20:39:41	thang1	haven't started... I'm planning on doing it in haskell ._.
2016-01-25 20:40:52	thang1	then there's quantum physics... and then a project for database systems ;-;
2016-01-25 20:41:02	thang1	oh yeah and like 3 days worth of piled up jewish literature
2016-01-25 20:41:04	thang1	fml
2016-01-25 20:41:25	Roonix	jewish literature?
2016-01-25 20:42:15	thang1	yeah, it's a class. I'm not at a jewish college or anything it's just a literature class focused on jewish lit. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
2016-01-25 20:42:35	Roonix	ahh I see
2016-01-25 20:45:48	Roonix	Jewish literature doesn't sound quite as interesting as quantum physics :D
2016-01-25 20:46:02	thang1	yeah, it's not. I like quantum physics though, and I like the jewish lit teacher so it works out
2016-01-25 20:47:48	Roonix	shame they wouldn't allow Einstein writings on quantum theory to be classed as Jewish literature :D
2016-01-25 20:48:02	thang1	hah, that's not the kinda jewish lit they want to focus on in class anyway 
2016-01-25 20:48:11	Roonix	^_^
2016-01-25 20:53:01	@z3bra	yay
2016-01-25 20:53:13	@z3bra	now I fully understand how containers works!
2016-01-25 20:53:19	@z3bra	(regarding the network stack)
2016-01-25 20:53:48	fyr	oohoo
2016-01-25 20:54:50	thang1	nice
2016-01-25 20:55:04	thang1	like docker containers or what? (sorry, not quite sure what you mean by network stack)
2016-01-25 20:56:42	@z3bra	more like lxc
2016-01-25 20:56:52	@z3bra	docker is an app-container system
2016-01-25 20:56:59	@z3bra	though it works the same
2016-01-25 20:57:31	@z3bra	by network stack, I mean giving network access to PIDs running inside a PID namespace
2016-01-25 20:57:37	@z3bra	(aka, container :P)
2016-01-25 20:58:05	thang1	ah got it
2016-01-25 20:58:11	thang1	kinda :p
2016-01-25 20:58:18	@z3bra	I've been using the "contain" utility from here to test: https://github.com/arachsys/containers
2016-01-25 20:58:39	thang1	oooh shiny
2016-01-25 20:58:56	@z3bra	it lets you run commands in a chrooted PID/User namespace
2016-01-25 20:58:58	thang1	why don't you use the systemd nspawn thingey? It works perfectly /s
2016-01-25 20:59:08	@z3bra	because I don't have systemd? :O
2016-01-25 20:59:10	@z3bra	:P
2016-01-25 20:59:23	thang1	lol I know, hence the "/s"
2016-01-25 20:59:27	@z3bra	also, it's meant for testing purpose
2016-01-25 20:59:29	thang1	you know what I need in my life?
2016-01-25 20:59:37	thang1	I want a split mechanical keyboard
2016-01-25 20:59:39	@z3bra	slaps
2016-01-25 20:59:41	thang1	that I can strap to my arms somehow
2016-01-25 20:59:43	@z3bra	oh
2016-01-25 20:59:54	thang1	so like I can just recline in a chair and put a projector on the wall
2016-01-25 21:00:01	thang1	and manipulate shit with just the keyboard :D
2016-01-25 21:00:16	thang1	strap a trackball mouse on there somehow and jizz from the amazingness of it all
2016-01-25 21:00:24	thang1	s/chair/beanbag/
2016-01-25 21:00:58	thang1	or pace the floor and angrily pound on my wrist-attached keyboard thingeys as I type out a rant-mail to the morons in IT here
2016-01-25 21:08:27	@z3bra	haha

2016-01-26 11:30:56	xcelq	rocx: i was trolling but yeah it wouldn't surprise me
2016-01-26 11:30:56	eldritch	so apparently using the program "colors" from any directory other than the one its installed in results in my terminals crashing
2016-01-26 11:30:58	eldritch	neat
2016-01-26 11:31:05	xcelq	LOL
2016-01-26 11:31:46	xcelq	don't you love stupid programmer errors?
2016-01-26 11:31:52	xcelq	like how did you not overlook that
2016-01-26 11:32:07	eldritch	I don't think this is a stupid programmer error, given that z3bra uses it and never has problems
2016-01-26 11:32:14	eldritch	I think I just have some extremely obscure problem
2016-01-26 11:32:41	rocx	or it could've been tailored to his system.

2016-01-26 11:33:26	eldritch	like 90% of my various scripts and hacks are kludgy abominations that i created by ripping off z3bras scripts and then trying to make them work on my machine

2016-01-26 11:38:41	xcelq	eldritch: you mean like zealots?
2016-01-26 11:39:13	eldritch	imagine fundamentalist christians except instead of asking for your money and hating gay people they ask you not to give anyone money and hate everyone who uses computers
2016-01-26 11:39:28	xcelq	yeah that is annoying
2016-01-26 11:39:51	xcelq	or to only use fsf approved hardware /software

2016-02-08 22:29:00	mort_	how are you
2016-02-08 22:29:10	kirby	Good thanks
2016-02-08 22:29:20	mort_	good.
2016-02-08 22:31:15	kirby	Got to finish a load of design documents and crap for Software Engineering by the end of the week ;-;
2016-02-08 22:31:28	kirby	It's a group project and we're just bs'ing the methodology.
2016-02-08 22:31:34	mort_	:(
2016-02-08 22:32:03	mort_	I'm currently in a lecture about rationalism vs empiricism and a bunch of philosophers 
2016-02-08 22:32:13	kirby	lolwat why
2016-02-08 22:32:34	mort_	idk, norway has decided everyone in university should go through a philosophy course
2016-02-08 22:32:42	kirby	Man that sucks
2016-02-08 22:32:45	mort_	mhm
2016-02-08 22:32:55	mort_	aristotle was apparently mostly wrong
2016-02-08 22:36:11	kirby	We had Philosophy as an optional last year
2016-02-08 22:36:24	kirby	My friend went to the intro lecture and said they finished with "what is a chair?"
2016-02-08 22:36:27	kirby	He never went back.
2016-02-08 22:36:59	mort_	we had a lecture a couple weeks ago about the difference between how a snowman grows and how a human grows
2016-02-08 22:37:28	mort_	that a snowman grows by external forces, while humans grow by themselves
2016-02-08 22:37:32	mort_	not entirely sure what the point was
2016-02-08 22:37:46	kirby	Psudeo-intellectualism?
2016-02-08 22:37:51	kirby	:P
2016-02-08 22:37:56	mort_	lol, maybe

2016-02-08 23:23:44	mort_	this is getting kind of annoying
2016-02-08 23:24:01	@z3bra	why do you upgrade the kernel then?
2016-02-08 23:25:29	mort_	because it's easier to just pacman -Syu, and really, I prioritize being on the newest kernel over not having to spend a little time tethering my phone to my computer and running the command which fixes wifi every once in a while

2016-02-08 23:26:32	@z3bra	best of both worlds.
2016-02-08 23:27:06	mort_	fry: if I wanted to not be on the latest everything, I wouldn't be using arch, so I do indeed welcome the world of being "pushed around by the developers" (e.g using the latest version of their software)
2016-02-08 23:27:08	@z3bra	(or you could make use of the pacman hooks)
2016-02-08 23:28:09	mort_	as I said though, I prioritize being on the newest kernel over not having to spend a little time tethering my phone to my computer and running the command which fixes wifi every once in a while
2016-02-08 23:28:30	@z3bra	hence why I proposed pacman hooks
2016-02-08 23:28:49	@z3bra	aka "run an arbitrary command when something special happens"
2016-02-08 23:29:04	@z3bra	eg, fixing your wifi when the kernel gets upgraded
2016-02-08 23:29:24	mort_	that sounds sane

2016-02-08 23:49:52	+dcat	since you start with P1OUT as 1
2016-02-08 23:50:06	thang1	My school does ARM assembly every year and we often use those for final projects (or at least we did last year). I'd love to be able to ~~steal~~ use that as some examples for friends. I already had to go through all the pain and shit myself :|
2016-02-08 23:50:07	+dcat	and cause of P1OUT ^= 0b1000001;
2016-02-08 23:50:17	thang1	but of course we never used C, we had to go straight pure MIPS assembly :p
2016-02-08 23:50:25	+dcat	it'll constantly toggle between 0b1000000 and 0b0000001

2016-02-08 23:59:08	%vypr	https://store.ti.com/MSP-EXP430G2-MSP430-LaunchPad-Value-Line-Development-kit-P2031.aspx
2016-02-08 23:59:11	%vypr	?
2016-02-09 00:00:23	+dcat	yup
2016-02-09 00:08:54	thang1	it's pretty awesome actually
2016-02-09 00:09:12	%vypr	can you use other addons besides the boosterpacks?
2016-02-09 00:09:17	%vypr	the answer is yes
2016-02-09 00:09:20	thang1	really hard to find a better kit for cheaper. Especially when you factor in documentation. Nobody wants a $5 POS chinese shit with no english documentation
2016-02-09 00:09:24	%vypr	but in terms of what i mean
2016-02-09 00:09:36	%vypr	is: is it difficult to add other things to it?
2016-02-09 00:09:39	%vypr	like LCD screens, etc
2016-02-09 00:10:42	%vypr	im a noob to this so forgive me
2016-02-09 00:15:01	+dcat	vypr: depends on the interface
2016-02-09 00:16:04	+dcat	if it's SPI, probably not
2016-02-09 00:16:50	+dcat	keep in mind that you won't have as many pins as on the atmega328 (arduino)
2016-02-09 00:17:04	+dcat	so if you wanna attach a ton of stuff, it'll be harder
2016-02-09 00:17:16	%vypr	mhmm
2016-02-09 00:24:11	thang1	I fukking hate doing homework without an eraser
2016-02-09 00:24:18	thang1	why the fuck did I forget my eraser in the lab anyway -_-
2016-02-09 00:24:55	mort_	You mean like
2016-02-09 00:25:04	mort_	The backspace key fell off?
2016-02-09 00:25:13	+dcat	lel
2016-02-09 00:25:32	+dcat	>using old world tech
2016-02-09 00:25:35	+dcat	nigga pls
2016-02-09 00:26:18	thang1	it's not economical to write my physics homework in LaTeX lol
2016-02-09 00:26:32	thang1	you know how many fukking psi's and shit with gigantic fractions I have to write?
2016-02-09 00:26:37	stark	> not vim'ing in reality
2016-02-09 00:26:54	thang1	Although I suppose I could just make macros of all the most common equations and abuse mathematica's export to LaTeX function...
2016-02-09 00:27:19	mort_	You should
2016-02-09 00:27:53	thang1	too late now :p
2016-02-09 00:28:44	stark	dcat, what happened to dead.cat ?
2016-02-09 00:28:48	mort_	Why? Just scan it and write some software to convert it to LaTeX
2016-02-09 00:28:58	thang1	you have any idea how hard that is?
2016-02-09 00:29:30	thang1	I mean, even if my handwriting is perfect it's still stupidly hard. Like, it's very difficult to generate latex correctly given a scanned representation of latex generated math equations...
2016-02-09 00:29:40	thang1	never mind human handwriting lol
2016-02-09 00:30:00	mort_	Just get some neural networks 
2016-02-09 00:30:05	thang1	right
2016-02-09 00:30:32	+dcat	stark: dami took it down
2016-02-09 00:30:38	mort_	Strong AI should do it at least
2016-02-09 00:33:03	thang1	Oh strong AI of course
2016-02-09 00:33:05	thang1	why didn't I think of that
2016-02-09 00:33:19	thang1	I'll just write a simple program in C that writes a slightly better version of itself and then leave it on a loop
2016-02-09 00:33:27	thang1	when it becomes Jesus I'll ask it to do my homework for me /s
2016-02-09 00:33:38	mort_	Exactly

2016-02-09 04:50:47	rocx	or use whatever that f.lex port is called.

2016-02-09 05:34:48	fyr	DVI-I supports analogue connections, but you'll need to get an adapter for VGA to DVI-I
2016-02-09 05:35:12	ubuuu	why VGA?
2016-02-09 05:35:34	fyr	do you have a VGA monitor or not?

2016-02-09 05:38:16	fyr	yw buddy
2016-02-09 05:39:11	ubuuu	but you still cant connect a VGA into a dvi-i because the pins wont fit. unless you have some sort of adapter
2016-02-09 05:39:36	fyr	yes
2016-02-09 05:39:40	fyr	that's what I was saying
2016-02-09 05:39:58	ubuuu	owh okey sry i most have mistunderstood
2016-02-09 05:40:30	fyr	m a g i c a l
2016-02-09 05:45:30	boobah	he was saying that using a passive DVI/VGA adapter would be *possible*, not that the two would mate without such an interposer
2016-02-09 05:46:18	ubuuu	but i didnt mention VGA so i was confused 
2016-02-09 05:46:37	boobah	all good :)
2016-02-09 05:47:09	ubuuu	btw does dvi provide better quality or same?
2016-02-09 05:47:58	fyr	analogue does depend on the cable quality
2016-02-09 05:48:09	fyr	digital there's no difference between cables
2016-02-09 05:48:32	fyr	all in all you'll never notice a difference between digital cables, ever.
2016-02-09 05:48:59	boobah	what fyr said. VGA usually looks like shit on LCDs with a resolution higher than 800x600.
2016-02-09 05:49:29	boobah	not to mention that most VGA cables bundled nowadays have nearly *no* shielding, compared to the thicker cables that used to be the norm when CRTs dominated
2016-02-09 05:49:58	fyr	those cheapskates!
2016-02-09 05:50:41	boobah	not to mention that display auto-configuration is usually much smoother through purely digital interfaces like dvi, hdmi and dp
2016-02-09 05:51:11	boobah	it's quite easy to drive a vga display at the wrong resolution and refresh rate, and you have to "auto adjust" the picture and all that shit
2016-02-09 05:51:34	boobah	tl;dr: use digital display interfaces. it's 2016 (:
2016-02-09 05:53:04	boobah	i had an interesting fiasco over this past weekend with my monitor being driven 0.1 Hz too low by Xorg, and it was causing artifacts. really frustrating, and it took me way too long to pinpoint the problem.
2016-02-09 05:53:36	boobah	i was so scared that either my monitor or graphics card were dying
2016-02-09 05:54:22	fyr	nah just X11 fucking with you
2016-02-09 05:54:27	fyr	like it fucks with us all
2016-02-09 05:54:30	ubuuu	haha 
2016-02-09 05:54:36	fyr	still better than waylame though
2016-02-09 05:56:10	ubuuu	my monitor did follow with a VGA but i accidently bought a DVI adapter but my monitor also had a DVI-D port so i just bought a cable and now im waiting for the cable to arrive
2016-02-09 05:56:52	boobah	lol
2016-02-09 05:57:29	ubuuu	and then i found about the dvi-d and dvi-i so i was more worried

2016-02-09 06:44:43	xyz	hahaha
2016-02-09 06:44:58	rocx	once you learn vi{m,} bindings, it's hard to let them go.
2016-02-09 06:45:08	rocx	and emacs's default navigation bindings are retarded.

2016-02-09 06:47:02	fyr	I don't think I could even quit emacs
2016-02-09 06:47:24	rocx	still need to learn my way around org-mode.
2016-02-09 06:47:44	xyz	i do use cabbage tho https://github.com/senny/cabbage
2016-02-09 06:48:19	rocx	> installation via `bash -c $(curl whatever/install.sh)`
2016-02-09 06:48:20	rocx	wow.
2016-02-09 06:48:36	rocx	then again, that's about as secure as just installing a package from your distro's repository.
2016-02-09 06:49:25	rocx	not a fan of "starter packs". i felt the best way to learn emacs was to run a search for how you want to control it and build an ~/.emacs.d from scratch.
2016-02-09 06:50:09	rocx	then find some other hosers' configurations on github, then read them.
2016-02-09 06:53:42	@xero	isn't that "how you do" all configs?
2016-02-09 06:53:59	wesbl	fyr: why emacs is better?
2016-02-09 06:54:04	rocx	sure. but i say it's much better to start from scratch and build up rather than have something pre-prepared.
2016-02-09 06:54:08	fyr	wesbl, never
2016-02-09 06:54:30	rocx	fyr: can you emulate vim in vim? 
2016-02-09 06:54:35	rocx	didn't think so. you can in emacs.
2016-02-09 06:54:36	wesbl	fyr: i mean, why do you prefer emacs?
2016-02-09 06:54:42	fyr	wesbl, I don't
2016-02-09 06:54:53	rocx	thus, emacs is superior.
2016-02-09 06:54:54	fyr	rocx, you can with neovim!
2016-02-09 06:55:06	rocx	neovim is for ninnies anyway.
2016-02-09 06:55:12	*	fyr shrugs
2016-02-09 06:55:16	wesbl	rocx: why superior?
2016-02-09 06:55:21	fyr	still better than elame
2016-02-09 06:55:37	@xero	vi vi vi
2016-02-09 06:55:39	rocx	because you can emulate vim and then some.
2016-02-09 06:57:19	rocx	eh i jest.
2016-02-09 06:57:34	rocx	i switched just to streamline my workflow into a program that's meant to.
2016-02-09 06:57:43	rocx	and because of SLIME for learning common lisp.
2016-02-09 07:01:14	+dcat	rocx: I changed my mind
2016-02-09 07:01:18	+dcat	no way I can do it

2016-02-09 07:01:37	+dcat	nah
2016-02-09 07:01:44	@xero	dcat++
2016-02-09 07:01:49	+dcat	I just can't take it
2016-02-09 07:01:54	rocx	alright then.
2016-02-09 07:02:12	+dcat	it seems like most people use it with "evil-mode"
2016-02-09 07:02:16	rocx	yep.
2016-02-09 07:02:25	rocx	well, at least i do.
2016-02-09 07:02:29	@xero	if i wanted that many chords id just play guitar
2016-02-09 07:02:32	+dcat	running emacs to emulate vi
2016-02-09 07:02:43	+dcat	I do run my shell in emacs mode though
2016-02-09 07:02:54	rocx	emacs is the environment. vi emulation is for editing.
2016-02-09 07:03:12	+dcat	mostly use ^A ^E ^[F ^[B and such
2016-02-09 07:03:30	rocx	those come in handy since i disable evil-mode just for erc/circe buffers.
2016-02-09 07:03:52	+dcat	for the non-nerdy people in here
2016-02-09 07:03:56	+dcat	^[ is alt/esc
2016-02-09 07:04:34	+dcat	and now a ton of people are gonna try using esc+<key> instead of alt+<key>
2016-02-09 07:04:58	rocx	that was the only way i could get irssi to work between channels.
2016-02-09 07:05:14	rocx	Esc+<key>.
2016-02-09 07:05:18	+dcat	in which term?
2016-02-09 07:05:34	rocx	think in all of them. mostly urxvt. didn't stay in st-xresources for long.
2016-02-09 07:05:59	rocx	https://github.com/rocx/.emacs.d/blob/master/init.el#L51 and this part would come in handy when dealing with evil.
2016-02-09 07:06:06	+dcat	hrm
2016-02-09 07:06:13	+dcat	what was the problem with my fork?
2016-02-09 07:06:34	rocx	there wasn't a problem with it. i just didn't use it for long because that's when i made...
2016-02-09 07:06:36	rocx	...the switch.
2016-02-09 07:06:51	+dcat	to what?
2016-02-09 07:06:57	rocx	to emacs.
2016-02-09 07:07:00	@xero	to crack
2016-02-09 07:07:16	+dcat	just cause you use a shitty editor doesn't mean you need a shitty term though
2016-02-09 07:07:30	@xero	he uses the GUI EMACS
2016-02-09 07:07:38	rocx	gtk2 one.
2016-02-09 07:07:49	@xero	BURN THE HERETIC!!!!
2016-02-09 07:07:58	*	rocx activates the Absolute Safety Capsule.
2016-02-09 07:08:00	+dcat	oh god
2016-02-09 07:08:26	rocx	easier to choose what font i please and the colors can change more on a whim.
2016-02-09 07:08:30	rocx	and i'm not limited to 256 of them.
2016-02-09 07:08:49	@xero	rocx uses emacs to see colors
2016-02-09 07:09:05	rocx	MORE colors. rainbow-mode comes in handy when dealing with css.
2016-02-09 07:09:56	rocx	granted if i ran this editor my way, it'd be more of a scheme-based one (like guile emacs), and doesn't include two irc clients out of the box for starters.
2016-02-09 07:10:12	+dcat	hell
2016-02-09 07:10:15	rocx	no really i'm not going to pretend it's the holiest editor i ever used.
2016-02-09 07:10:18	+dcat	xterm can do truecolor
2016-02-09 07:10:24	+dcat	that's a shitty excuse
2016-02-09 07:10:30	rocx	but... that's xterm.
2016-02-09 07:10:48	rocx	for some reason i'm just not that big of a fan of the typical dumb terminal style anymore.
2016-02-09 07:11:26	@xero	http://lists.suckless.org/dev/1307/16688.html
2016-02-09 07:11:32	@xero	st supports true color as well
2016-02-09 07:12:01	rocx	huh. like i said, colors aren't the only reason.
2016-02-09 07:12:59	rocx	sometimes, graphics come in handy. not for 100% of the time but sometimes it helps. this is one reason i say plan 9 had the right idea to still keep the terminal and shell the primary interface, but make it flexible enough to do... gasp... GRAPHICS.
2016-02-09 07:13:17	fyr	I should look into st...
2016-02-09 07:13:23	fyr	been meaning to forever
2016-02-09 07:13:30	fyr	oh well too late to do so now
2016-02-09 07:13:34	fyr	gotta go bed
2016-02-09 07:13:41	@xero	fyr: good starting point: https://github.com/dcat/st-xresources
2016-02-09 07:13:50	rocx	yes. it's a good point to start.
2016-02-09 07:16:13	fyr	okay thanks guys

2016-02-09 07:28:13	rocx	just ask away.
2016-02-09 07:28:21	@xero	wesbl: z3bra 
2016-02-09 07:28:27	@xero	but yeah, just ask
2016-02-09 07:28:31	rocx	xero: does z3bra use vim or nvi?
2016-02-09 07:28:42	@xero	both/either
2016-02-09 07:28:48	@xero	he's my vim guru
2016-02-09 07:28:55	@xero	but much of that info is the same between editors
2016-02-09 07:29:10	rocx	except for plugins.
2016-02-09 07:29:13	rocx	and visual state.
2016-02-09 07:29:16	@xero	>much
2016-02-09 07:29:30	rocx	touche.
2016-02-09 07:30:13	wesbl	xero: why when i paste certain text it puts always on the first line? o_O
2016-02-09 07:30:37	@xero	:set paste
2016-02-09 07:30:37	@xero	???
2016-02-09 07:30:48	@xero	also
2016-02-09 07:31:01	@xero	paste from vim? or paste from clipbloard TO vim?
2016-02-09 07:31:56	wesbl	xero: no, from clipboard, but it happened only 2 times
2016-02-09 07:32:58	@xero	i'd say, make sure you're in insert mode, and in paste mode before you paste 
2016-02-09 07:36:51	xyz	so the hangover is real
2016-02-09 07:36:55	xyz	fucking a

2016-02-09 07:41:22	@z3bra	vis yeah
2016-02-09 07:41:32	@z3bra	the default conf is now sane enough
2016-02-09 07:41:41	@z3bra	and reliable enough
2016-02-09 07:45:03	@z3bra	I can still spot a few bugs here and there
2016-02-09 07:45:24	@z3bra	but Tanner fix them really quickly
2016-02-09 07:50:08	@z3bra	I just hope he's not gonna go the vim route, and try to implement as much as possible
2016-02-09 07:51:20	rocx	oh right. 
2016-02-09 07:51:43	rocx	are you pretty much taking over its development? just doing your own fork?
2016-02-09 07:53:11	@z3bra	nothing yet
2016-02-09 07:53:26	@z3bra	it works well enough for my usecase
2016-02-09 07:53:42	rocx	how's configuration going to work? just the `mg` route?
2016-02-09 07:53:54	@z3bra	config.h in this case
2016-02-09 07:53:58	rocx	:\
2016-02-09 07:54:31	@z3bra	to be fair, the default are extremely sane
2016-02-09 07:55:18	rocx	still.
2016-02-09 07:55:25	@z3bra	I'm starting to get tired of configuring things :P
2016-02-09 07:56:06	rocx	maybe having to deal with configuration headers finally got to ya.
2016-02-09 07:56:14	@z3bra	haha, maybe
2016-02-09 07:56:44	@z3bra	but no, in fact
2016-02-09 07:57:07	@z3bra	'cause I still configure st

2016-02-09 08:05:14	rocx	z3bra: i like lisp too much.
2016-02-09 08:05:18	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:05:20	boobah	rocx: you can make stuff in lisp if you wanted to
2016-02-09 08:05:28	rocx	i know but it won't quite be the same.
2016-02-09 08:06:03	boobah	z3bra: i feel ya, for sure. i've been wanting to make an editor for a while now, but it's surprisingly tough for someone who hasn't implemented efficient editable text buffers before
2016-02-09 08:06:27	@z3bra	I have NEVER used mmap before
2016-02-09 08:06:31	rocx	heck, i almost want to write my own emacs clone that doesn't suck.
2016-02-09 08:06:54	@z3bra	yaemacs
2016-02-09 08:06:55	@xero	dont make it an emacs clone then

2016-02-09 08:07:04	@z3bra	emax
2016-02-09 08:07:09	@xero	just make and editor that you thinks is "correct"
2016-02-09 08:07:13	rocx	adam: THAT'S PERFECT YOU'RE GETTING A PROMOTION!

2016-02-09 08:07:24	%adam	yay
2016-02-09 08:07:59	boobah	z3bra: yeah, mmap seems really useful for this type of thing. not to mention transparent kernel-level file-seek abstraction
2016-02-09 08:08:16	@z3bra	it's hard to get it right
2016-02-09 08:08:31	@z3bra	I used my first mmap recently "for real"
2016-02-09 08:08:33	@z3bra	like
2016-02-09 08:08:37	rocx	fffffffs. wow i forgot how much i hated java.
2016-02-09 08:08:38	boobah	rocx: i just went up in my scrollbuffer and read what you were saying about plan9 having the right idea with more flexible terminal-like interfaces
2016-02-09 08:08:46	@z3bra	in a program that I consider finished and that I use
2016-02-09 08:08:47	boobah	i have been thinking about this a lot lately
2016-02-09 08:08:59	boobah	z3bra: one we know?
2016-02-09 08:09:14	@z3bra	wendy
2016-02-09 08:09:18	rocx	boobah: heck, the new wave of editors for it don't have to be mouse-based. there would've still been a keyboard-exclusive clique even if it took off.
2016-02-09 08:09:24	boobah	ah, good ol wendy. love that thing.
2016-02-09 08:09:29	rocx	very handy,
2016-02-09 08:09:35	@z3bra	I changed it a lot
2016-02-09 08:09:36	boobah	rocx: YES
2016-02-09 08:09:38	@z3bra	well
2016-02-09 08:09:41	@z3bra	"a lot"
2016-02-09 08:09:57	boobah	rocx: I actually posted a few ideas relating to this on another forum. Lemme see if my post is still online
2016-02-09 08:10:10	@z3bra	aaah no
2016-02-09 08:10:13	@z3bra	that was in pm
2016-02-09 08:10:14	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:10:43	boobah	what do you mean?
2016-02-09 08:11:02	@z3bra	I mmap the file containing the list of files created
2016-02-09 08:11:10	@z3bra	'pm' is my pack manager
2016-02-09 08:12:14	boobah	ohhhh, gotcha. lol, i thought you were saying my post was a (p)rivate (m)essage. :)
2016-02-09 08:13:05	rocx	fffff. wow i really hate java now.
2016-02-09 08:13:19	@xero	ohhhh, gotcha. lol, i thought you were syaing my post as (P)ost (M)eridiem
2016-02-09 08:13:19	@z3bra	why did it took you so long?
2016-02-09 08:13:22	rocx	local class, creating an object of that class, "cannot find symbol" when compiling.
2016-02-09 08:13:50	rocx	yes, the object is compiled too.

2016-02-09 08:22:13	@z3bra	oh greduan 
2016-02-09 08:22:14	greduan	Especially in JS if I want to make it performant.
2016-02-09 08:22:16	boobah	greduan: tell us
2016-02-09 08:22:17	chc4	probably because youre writing it in a shit language
2016-02-09 08:22:22	chc4	just use atom
2016-02-09 08:22:25	@z3bra	btw I saw your question
2016-02-09 08:22:26	greduan	chc4: truly not a language for editors
2016-02-09 08:22:36	greduan	z3bra: cool
2016-02-09 08:22:45	@z3bra	to answer your question
2016-02-09 08:22:49	@z3bra	I think it's possible
2016-02-09 08:22:53	@z3bra	but
2016-02-09 08:22:57	@z3bra	I'm not sure
2016-02-09 08:23:04	greduan	cool
2016-02-09 08:23:08	@z3bra	I don't play wit the config much
2016-02-09 08:23:09	greduan	I'm just waiting for that Lua magic
2016-02-09 08:23:23	@z3bra	I hope this will not happen
2016-02-09 08:23:34	@z3bra	otherwise, this will become a shitty vim clone
2016-02-09 08:23:34	greduan	although if you want a text editor extendable in Lua, check out TextAdept
2016-02-09 08:23:41	@z3bra	with a shitons of plugins
2016-02-09 08:23:45	greduan	z3bra: the author is probably aware
2016-02-09 08:23:56	greduan	I just hope at some point I an define my own operators and motions/text-objects
2016-02-09 08:24:03	greduan	can*
2016-02-09 08:24:04	greduan	anyway
2016-02-09 08:24:20	@z3bra	 { "ap",                 ACTION(TEXT_OBJECT_PARAGRAPH)
2016-02-09 08:24:26	rocx	greduan: ZILE if you want lua.
2016-02-09 08:24:43	greduan	I thought ZILE was too basic to be extended?
2016-02-09 08:24:43	boobah	greduan: i started writing a terminal, shell and unix-like environment in JS. you'd be the guy interested.
2016-02-09 08:24:54	greduan	boobah: how the fuck? lol
2016-02-09 08:24:55	boobah	zile's old as hell, isn't it?
2016-02-09 08:24:56	rocx	i got no clue if it's even still being worked on.
2016-02-09 08:25:02	@z3bra	boobah, no we're not
2016-02-09 08:25:04	@z3bra	maaaan
2016-02-09 08:25:05	@z3bra	honestly
2016-02-09 08:25:06	@z3bra	JS
2016-02-09 08:25:11	greduan	lol
2016-02-09 08:25:14	greduan	My editor is being coded in Node.js, server-side JavaScript as you all probably know. This means it's FUCKING hard to manage memory because in JS I don't get access to that shit.
2016-02-09 08:25:20	rocx	i had to fiddle with JS for a project once and it was awful.
2016-02-09 08:25:24	greduan	You do NOT want to code a terminal in that shit
2016-02-09 08:25:27	greduan	Or a shell
2016-02-09 08:25:27	@xero	greduan thank you for becoming the resident js whipping boy. i dont miss it one bit.
2016-02-09 08:25:34	greduan	xero: lol
2016-02-09 08:25:38	greduan	they asked
2016-02-09 08:25:51	@xero	;D
2016-02-09 08:25:52	 < 	chc4 (chc4@Clk-90E2C44F.nycap.res.rr.com) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2016-02-09 08:25:56	boobah	greduan: i mean, i'm only a few hundred lines in. but it's kinda fun doing everything manually. just a fun project i can run in a browser
2016-02-09 08:26:05	rocx	well crap yet another CLASSPATH problem.
2016-02-09 08:26:07	greduan	Anyway, the concepts for my editor are way clearer now, will probably turn out similar to SAM (?), I need more research on that.
2016-02-09 08:26:13	greduan	boobah: cool
2016-02-09 08:26:14	greduan	got a repo?
2016-02-09 08:26:18	boobah	by manually i mean like using setInterval() to flash the terminal cursor, which itself is a <div> with a background color
2016-02-09 08:26:26	greduan	ah
2016-02-09 08:26:34	boobah	nah, not yet. i'll MSG you if/when
2016-02-09 08:26:35	greduan	so you're not actually doing a shell to the OS?
2016-02-09 08:27:07	@z3bra	./x86_64-spoink-linux-musl-cc hello.c
2016-02-09 08:27:08	@z3bra	eat that
2016-02-09 08:27:11	@z3bra	bithc
2016-02-09 08:27:33	boobah	yeah, i'm completely modularizing everything. jsterm is the terminal component, jsh is the shell, and i'm writing some commands as well as a basic filesystem interface
2016-02-09 08:27:58	greduan	damn son
2016-02-09 08:27:59	boobah	super high-level emulation of decently low-level stuff :)
2016-02-09 08:28:21	boobah	when you make a JSTerm object, you give it a JSH object to interact with
2016-02-09 08:28:33	greduan	ic
2016-02-09 08:28:36	boobah	it's kind of shit but still fun, because i'm not yet skilled to do this in C yet
2016-02-09 08:28:47	rocx	i can't even grasp pointers in c no matter how i try.
2016-02-09 08:28:50	greduan	I assure you if you want to do it right, it's way easier in C
2016-02-09 08:29:05	greduan	why do people have so much trouble with pointers in C? lol
2016-02-09 08:29:12	@z3bra	guys
2016-02-09 08:29:17	@xero	^^
2016-02-09 08:29:17	rocx	greduan: iunno.
2016-02-09 08:29:19	rocx	i just suck.
2016-02-09 08:29:20	greduan	is a pointer not just a reference to some point in memory?
2016-02-09 08:29:23	@z3bra	stop saying that you're not good enough in C
2016-02-09 08:29:26	rocx	yeah but it's mainly when to do them
2016-02-09 08:29:30	@z3bra	and start writing C
2016-02-09 08:29:32	boobah	pointers themselves aren't confusing, but it gets weird trying to visualize multiple layers of pointers in memory in your head
2016-02-09 08:29:33	greduan	^^
2016-02-09 08:29:46	greduan	^^ meant for z3bra 
2016-02-09 08:29:53	boobah	3zbra: i *am* writing things in C, lol. just not a terminal yet
2016-02-09 08:30:09	greduan	boobah: HA! That's what JS objects are like bro.
2016-02-09 08:30:10	rocx	i like lisp too much to go back.
2016-02-09 08:30:11	boobah	because that involves knowledge of the Linux API. I'm reading a book atm
2016-02-09 08:30:30	greduan	you should probably start with a command line command
2016-02-09 08:30:32	@z3bra	cross your fingers for me guys...
2016-02-09 08:30:40	boobah	greduan: true. i feel like JS is really complex but it's also pretty beginner-friendly. because i'm dumb as shit and can still make stuff with it
2016-02-09 08:30:45	@z3bra	trying to pack gcc right now
2016-02-09 08:30:45	*	xero crosses his fingers
2016-02-09 08:30:57	greduan	z3bra: Crossing my fingers in my mind.
2016-02-09 08:31:12	greduan	boobah: JS is stupid as fuck, but it has a couple good concepts which make it cool.
2016-02-09 08:31:32	boobah	greduan, z3bra: i've written simple implementations of things like cat, echo, tee, pwd, and some other custom utilities
2016-02-09 08:31:43	greduan	cool
2016-02-09 08:31:45	@z3bra	doesn't count
2016-02-09 08:31:49	@z3bra	:P
2016-02-09 08:31:51	@z3bra	haha
2016-02-09 08:31:56	@xero	kekl
2016-02-09 08:31:57	greduan	read the POSIX implementation to write a shell
2016-02-09 08:31:58	boobah	okay z3bra :D
2016-02-09 08:32:03	greduan	xero: kackle
2016-02-09 08:32:07	greduan	cackle*
2016-02-09 08:32:08	greduan	?
2016-02-09 08:32:14	@xero	yes, but w/ a kek'
2016-02-09 08:32:47	@z3bra	the thing that helped me a lot in C is using a library that's not standard
2016-02-09 08:32:54	@z3bra	typically, inotify for wendy
2016-02-09 08:33:03	greduan	BUT THEN THERE'S NO STACKOVERFLOW
2016-02-09 08:33:05	boobah	yeah, one of the current projects is a simple shell called psh (named after the "pssh" vocal interjection)
2016-02-09 08:33:13	greduan	psh, that's easy
2016-02-09 08:33:15	boobah	z3bra: like musl?
2016-02-09 08:33:15	greduan	:P
2016-02-09 08:33:22	@z3bra	no
2016-02-09 08:33:24	greduan	boobah: musl follows the standard to the T lol
2016-02-09 08:33:28	boobah	oh, non-POSIX?
2016-02-09 08:33:30	@z3bra	musl is a libc
2016-02-09 08:33:35	@z3bra	so it's standard
2016-02-09 08:33:46	boobah	it doesn't follow completely POSIX actually
2016-02-09 08:33:55	boobah	(i've heard)
2016-02-09 08:33:58	@z3bra	I mean using something like libgit, libinotify, libpng or something like that
2016-02-09 08:34:09	greduan	libgit
2016-02-09 08:34:10	greduan	GET TO IT
2016-02-09 08:34:22	@z3bra	something that will force you to get out of the scanf() + if/else + printf()
2016-02-09 08:34:35	boobah	okay. fair enough. most of my library use has been on microcontrollers to do things like send SPI packets. dcat probably has done stuff like this too.
2016-02-09 08:34:54	boobah	z3bra: 2not using direct read() and write() syscalls
2016-02-09 08:35:06	@xero	uughhh

2016-02-09 08:35:36	@xero	it's called quoting

2016-02-09 08:39:12	%adam	oh that reminds me
2016-02-09 08:39:21	boobah	ohh, sorry. just wanted to make sure you would eventually look at my paste. take your time, but i wanna know your opinion on this. just MSG me whenever
2016-02-09 08:39:24	%adam	when i exit the channel is there a message about a hotel
2016-02-09 08:39:32	boobah	yes
2016-02-09 08:39:36	%adam	hell yeah

2016-02-09 08:40:27	%adam	i mean i may have boasted a bit but i enjoy learning about the system
2016-02-09 08:40:31	greduan	Hey do you know the inner workings of SAM?
2016-02-09 08:40:37	%adam	partially
2016-02-09 08:40:39	%adam	theres 2 parts to sam
2016-02-09 08:40:43	greduan	server and client?
2016-02-09 08:40:46	%adam	basically
2016-02-09 08:40:51	@xero	master and slave
2016-02-09 08:40:59	greduan	xero: in terms of processes
2016-02-09 08:41:04	%adam	the server is merely an engine that parses the ed-like commands
2016-02-09 08:41:13	*	xero cracks the whip on greduan 
2016-02-09 08:41:20	%adam	and then the client is "downloaded" into the current term window and thats the actual graphical interface

2016-02-09 08:43:13	boobah	i think that would be a feature of your client?
2016-02-09 08:43:25	greduan	I need to study the server end way more.

2016-02-09 09:11:54	S0lll0s	i know
2016-02-09 09:12:09	@xero	just sharing my opinion man
2016-02-09 09:12:23	S0lll0s	what I find a bit difficult is that a lot of FOSS projects rely completely on github for hosting and representation
2016-02-09 09:12:32	S0lll0s	xero: sorry that came off very wrong
2016-02-09 09:13:15	paul	For smaller FOSS projects, yes
2016-02-09 09:13:40	paul	but larger, more established FOSS projects have their own system
2016-02-09 09:13:43	@xero	imo using any corp to back OS work seems wrong. if you want to be indy be all indy and run your own git server like savannah

2016-02-09 09:54:40	@xero	i'd say the font you're using doesnt provide those sets
2016-02-09 09:54:48	@xero	did you try another font/
2016-02-09 09:54:48	@xero	?
2016-02-09 09:54:49	arc	it happens with every single font i try
2016-02-09 09:54:57	arc	the only one that appears to work is fixed
2016-02-09 09:55:03	arc	i'm using neep
2016-02-09 09:56:47	boobah	rc: neep doesn't have a unicode set, only iso8859 if i remember right
2016-02-09 09:56:51	boobah	arc
2016-02-09 09:57:03	boobah	fixed provides iso10646
2016-02-09 09:57:24	arc	well fuck
2016-02-09 09:57:58	boobah	that's why i stopped using neep about three years ago, but I would think it should still work with thingmenu
2016-02-09 09:58:51	arc	oh well
2016-02-09 09:58:58	arc	i guess it's only a menu for a link opener script
2016-02-09 09:58:58	@xero	you can try 9menu
2016-02-09 09:59:02	arc	doesn't matter much

2016-02-09 10:15:19	greduan	from some Ruby company?
2016-02-09 10:16:27	boobah	wondered what your setup's like. i usually just use the chromium debugger, because the interpretter's pretty nice, but is there something lighter i could be using?
2016-02-09 10:17:09	greduan	I do backend
2016-02-09 10:17:25	greduan	don't often se Chromium
2016-02-09 10:18:02	boobah	so it's all through node, then?
2016-02-09 10:18:16	boobah	how do you debug web-client scripts?
2016-02-09 10:18:29	boobah	such as the /client repo on noedit
2016-02-09 10:20:16	greduan	that's on the CLI
2016-02-09 10:20:20	greduan	but I didn't get too far on the client
2016-02-09 10:22:15	greduan	in fact in code I haven't gotten far at all
2016-02-09 10:22:17	boobah	so you like run `node-something file.js` and see if it spits out errors? curious how this works

2016-02-09 10:26:48	greduan	boobah: pretty much. you usually setup a logger and monitor that if your app is bigger.
2016-02-09 10:27:07	rocx	come to think of it, the current web standards are what's bringing us down.
2016-02-09 10:31:16	boobah	rocx: another thing i've been thinking about. my current idea is to write an awesome interface around the netsurf library. whatdya think?
2016-02-09 10:31:37	boobah	greduan: interesting. node looks cool.
2016-02-09 10:31:45	rocx	oh man i keep forgetting about netsurf.
2016-02-09 10:33:10	rocx	why can't more laptops and keyboards come with the trackpoint thing in the center?
2016-02-09 10:33:25	boobah	it's the only thing i've found that supports even html4
2016-02-09 10:33:38	rocx	html5's the new semantic alternative.
2016-02-09 10:33:39	boobah	which sucks, but i could live with it for a few years
2016-02-09 10:34:05	rocx	frankly, it kind of helps me structure in my head better when the tags are <article> rather than <div id="article">.
2016-02-09 10:34:15	boobah	i think the only laptops that still have it are a few dells and obviously thinkpads
2016-02-09 10:34:42	boobah	i'm with you, but all html5 engines are bloated as shit.

2016-02-09 10:50:03	rocx	it's like you can't get one with a decent processor without getting the biggest hard disk imaginable.
2016-02-09 10:50:08	boobah	just found out about servo 2 days ago. might check it out before it gets bloated too (if it isn't already, which I suspect, although the performance stats look great)

2016-02-09 11:35:44	boobah	i basically did `ls() { ls | blah; }` and then ran `ls`. i'm so dumb.
2016-02-09 11:36:29	boobah	i should have called `ls` as `env ls`
2016-02-09 11:38:03	greduan	!ls
2016-02-09 11:38:07	greduan	that runs the original iirc
2016-02-09 11:44:24	boobah	that runs a history-expansion for the last-run command starting with 'ls', so... might work? i don't wanna try it
2016-02-09 11:44:56	boobah	already killed my friend's irssi instance as well as my own. never again.

2016-02-09 11:46:58	boobah	S0lll0s: any advantage to using `command` instead of `env`
2016-02-09 11:46:59	boobah	?
2016-02-09 11:47:19	boobah	i know `command` is a builtin, that's why i usually avoid it
2016-02-09 11:47:41	boobah	although, it's a shell function so that part hardly matters
2016-02-09 11:48:06	OlaHughson	http://imgur.com/a/oqv5r
2016-02-09 11:48:07	S0lll0s	env also does environment-setting
2016-02-09 11:48:10	S0lll0s	if you want it to
2016-02-09 11:48:24	S0lll0s	"command" is just more basic and builtin i think
2016-02-09 11:48:46	boobah	good to know, forgot about that. and of course running it without any arguments is the same as `printenv`.
2016-02-09 11:48:51	S0lll0s	had to check if it was in bash even, i knew it was in fish
2016-02-09 11:48:56	S0lll0s	but apparently its POSIX
2016-02-09 11:49:11	boobah	it's in dash as well, so seems pretty safe

2016-02-09 13:45:44	chc4	some terminals have vim bindings
2016-02-09 13:45:49	chc4	or just use readline movements

2016-02-09 13:47:15	boobah	chc4: it's weird, i use all the emacs keys for the shell but i use vim keys for my editor. dunno why i like it that way

2016-02-09 13:48:33	boobah	what about it
2016-02-09 13:49:11	boobah	i'm saying i prefer the emacs mode in readline but i use vim... lol
2016-02-09 13:49:43	S0lll0s	well the command line has a very different typing/editing ratio than coding
2016-02-09 13:50:23	S0lll0s	programming is very little writing actually and in the terminal you spend the vast majority of the time just entering commands I'd say
2016-02-09 13:50:37	%adam	programming is just me drinking vodka

2016-02-09 13:51:53	boobah	it's just interesting because you can be pretty much just as fast with either keyset, but for some reason i like to split it up like that

2016-02-09 13:56:09	boobah	super interesting in principle, but there are too many symbolic maths for it to be fun for me
2016-02-09 13:56:17	fullsalvo	yeah, it's pretty abstract
2016-02-09 13:56:33	fullsalvo	plus it's pretty much just a statistics course
2016-02-09 13:56:42	boobah	too much of this for my taste: http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/quantum-mechanics-12908046.jpg

2016-02-09 13:59:29	boobah	i like learning about light and wave properties, but that's just too much non-numerical math
2016-02-09 14:00:05	%vypr	ur a wave property amirite
2016-02-09 14:00:45	fullsalvo	there's still a decent amount of numeric calculation in quantum in my opinion

2016-02-09 14:01:34	boobah	fullsalvo: maybe i just don't like math anymore. i dunno... math hasn't really been fun since Calculus BC in high school

2016-02-09 14:30:15	@rocx	it's just whoever's running this station's an idiot.

2016-02-09 14:33:51	dbcp	while we're on the topic, is there a command-line player that can play from Spotify and does scrobbling to Last.fm?
2016-02-09 14:34:22	dbcp	Because the default spotify player is about to piss me off tbh
2016-02-09 14:34:48	fullsalvo	ncmpcpp can do all of the above, I believe
2016-02-09 14:35:41	fullsalvo	dbcp: what bothers you about the default spotify player, though?
2016-02-09 14:36:41	%vypr	rocx: itunes
2016-02-09 14:37:12	@rocx	chc4: it's just what things call it when it's pushing an update of the playing song to your Last.FM thing.
2016-02-09 14:37:22	@rocx	dbcp: is it the ads?
2016-02-09 14:37:58	@rocx	'cause i noticed using a certain ho-

2016-02-09 14:38:03	@rocx	i don't have it.

2016-02-09 14:39:09	@rocx	http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/
2016-02-09 14:39:16	fullsalvo	mpd + mpdscribble is pretty nice for scrobbling
2016-02-09 14:39:30	@rocx	dbcp: using THIS hosts file (/etc/hosts), i noticed you can skip ads entirely in spotify desktop.
2016-02-09 14:39:32	fullsalvo	unless you're looking for the ability to "love" from the interface
2016-02-09 14:39:38	@rocx	but why do that when spotify is LACKING SONGS.
2016-02-09 14:39:55	boobah	everything lacks songs
2016-02-09 14:40:00	fullsalvo	^
2016-02-09 14:40:03	@rocx	boobah: THE SONGS I LIKE ARE THE ONES IT LACKS.
2016-02-09 14:40:06	fullsalvo	spotify is pretty nice, in my opinion
2016-02-09 14:40:06	@rocx	it never fails.
2016-02-09 14:40:12	fullsalvo	and it's $5 a month. That's nothing.
2016-02-09 14:40:24	@rocx	fullsalvo: well i'm a cheapskate.
2016-02-09 14:40:53	@rocx	but there *are* things on my last.fm that are not available on spoitfy.
2016-02-09 14:42:04	dbcp	Well, every time I update it there's a new issue.  Now, it seems like Ctrl-F no longer works and creating a new playlist causes weird issues.  
2016-02-09 14:42:15	@rocx	:\
2016-02-09 14:42:23	@rocx	to me, all spotify's good for is maybe branching out a bit.
2016-02-09 14:42:54	@rocx	and i swear if this station plays something ac/dc one more time i'mma kick someone in the groin.
2016-02-09 14:43:03	dbcp	I've had my music library as a spotify playlist for a good while now, and I'd hate to have to go back to downloading my music.  :/
2016-02-09 14:44:43	@rocx	acrap
2016-02-09 14:45:50	dbcp	Oh, and on the hosts file, I'm actually using https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
2016-02-09 14:46:24	@rocx	aw snap a consolidated hosts file.
2016-02-09 14:46:25	@rocx	genius.
2016-02-09 14:46:26	dbcp	I wasn't even aware the Spotify desktop app had ads... or at least I'd think it didn't have ads for premium users.  
2016-02-09 14:46:44	@rocx	dbcp: it had ads for free users. using the someonewhocares hosts solved that issue.
2016-02-09 14:48:23	dbcp	Ah, nice.  I guess the amalgamated list covers what someonewhocares covers
2016-02-09 14:49:22	@rocx	...we had a radio station called "The Bone"?
2016-02-09 14:50:42	dbcp	I have a cronjob that runs the script to update my hosts file based on that amalgamated list every day and I've almost forgotten that ads are a thing.  I also have it on my phone.  I recommended an app to my friend a while back and he ended up hating it because of the ads.  I was like "What ads?"  Apparently ads made it unusable.  
2016-02-09 14:53:00	@rocx	how'd you get it on your phone? rooting?
2016-02-09 14:53:10	@rocx	lucky.
2016-02-09 14:56:47	dbcp	Yep.  I just rooted my Nexus 6.  Before that, I had a rooted OnePlus One but it started doing funny shit like randomly rebooting, and it wouldn't work with my local carrier (CSpire), os I had shitty service with ATT on it.  
2016-02-09 14:57:04	@rocx	oh. so with $500+ phones. doesn't that ruin your warranty?
2016-02-09 14:57:56	dbcp	Well, I paid less for both phones lol.  And I got them both on eBay too, so... no real hope for warranty support.  
2016-02-09 14:58:26	@rocx	ah. probably going to see what i can do to root mine at some point.
2016-02-09 14:58:43	@rocx	i really *really* regret turning on the gps that one time.
2016-02-09 14:58:54	@rocx	now all the ads i get on spotify mobile are in spanish.
2016-02-09 15:00:30	@rocx	and firefox is seriously so slow it's pissing me off.
2016-02-09 15:00:40	dbcp	haha, that's hilarious.  Despite my nice hosts file, Amazon shows me shopping suggestions for things that I've reently googled.  Recently Amazon accosted me with suggestiongs that I buy a MLP pillow.  That's the last time I use google to find a video of something cringeworthy
2016-02-09 15:00:57	@rocx	> google
2016-02-09 15:01:00	@rocx	there's yer problem.
2016-02-09 15:01:42	dbcp	yeah, pretty much.  If DuckDuckSlow would actually work a little quicker, they'd have my business.  
2016-02-09 15:01:52	@rocx	never had an issue with speed.
2016-02-09 15:02:48	dbcp	That, and google is just good at search.
2016-02-09 15:03:07	dbcp	They take 2 more seconds than my patience is prepared to handle lol
2016-02-09 15:03:10	@rocx	pff. they suck at it and that's why i left it for bing back in 2009.
2016-02-09 15:03:25	@rocx	...which then started to suck then i switched to ddg in 2013.
2016-02-09 15:03:37	dbcp	I use bing at work because for some reason they have google link-follows blocked
2016-02-09 15:03:52	dbcp	And I get bing credits which is kind of nice
2016-02-09 15:07:05	@rocx	...wow. browser.xml "becoming unresponsive" is rage-inducing.

2016-02-15 23:39:58	sbrg	and I recently went through everything that I could possibly uninstall and removed a good deal

2016-02-16 01:23:45	%vypr	The language is pretty simple to learn and it'll only take a few months before you become decently fluent.

2016-02-16 04:13:31	TheLemonMan	I expected some cool combination of wmutils scripts

2016-02-16 04:13:41	+dcat	I am disappoint

2016-02-16 04:14:25	+dcat	arc: wat
2016-02-16 04:14:27	arc	and as much as you say you can script it, that's something that shouldn't be handled by a shell script
2016-02-16 04:14:34	arc	i mean i use wmutils
2016-02-16 04:15:04	arc	but something like dwm's tiling or a similar implementation would be better handled by a c program

2016-02-16 04:15:39	+dcat	that's why we made libwm
2016-02-16 04:16:38	arc	yeah it's something to look into
2016-02-16 04:16:40	+dcat	that's like holding a hammer and saying "this doesn't build a house"
2016-02-16 04:16:59	arc	but still
2016-02-16 04:17:07	arc	by the time you do fancy tiling with libwm and such
2016-02-16 04:17:12	arc	you're using a wm with libwm and wmutils as the backend
2016-02-16 04:17:46	+dcat	I don't understand what you're even saying
2016-02-16 04:17:57	+dcat	you do understand that wmutils is not a wm, right?
2016-02-16 04:18:01	arc	yes
2016-02-16 04:18:16	arc	but writing a tiling thing with libwm would be a wm
2016-02-16 04:18:22	arc	with wmutils as a backend to said wm
2016-02-16 04:18:39	+dcat	no
2016-02-16 04:18:46	+dcat	xcb would be the backend
2016-02-16 04:18:52	+dcat	wmutils would have nothing to do with it
2016-02-16 04:18:59	arc	now i'm confused
2016-02-16 04:19:15	stark	dcat, any ideas for launching application in specific groups via wmutils ?
2016-02-16 04:19:18	arc	you're saying 'that's why we made libwm' when i bring up 'wmutils doesn't do tiling'
2016-02-16 04:19:19	TheLemonMan	xcb isn't even a backend
2016-02-16 04:19:48	arc	so i assumed that implied libwm was created to add extra functionality to wmutils when that's probably not what it was designed for
2016-02-16 04:20:00	TheLemonMan	(from what I undestand) wmutils use libwm as backend
2016-02-16 04:20:06	arc	not anymore
2016-02-16 04:21:13	stark	also dcat totally forgot about this https://github.com/gstk/urxploitdvt
2016-02-16 04:21:32	stark	Scripting the opcodes
2016-02-16 04:21:34	+dcat	libwm is just wm routines in a library
2016-02-16 04:21:57	+dcat	completely unrelated to wmutils
2016-02-16 04:22:21	arc	it was related previously
2016-02-16 04:22:24	arc	as a dependency
2016-02-16 04:22:42	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:22:48	+dcat	but we removed it to make it more portable

2016-02-16 04:35:13	greduan	just ask yourself "what should this do?" and write a test that asserts that that happens
2016-02-16 04:35:16	greduan	and when it fails
2016-02-16 04:35:23	greduan	then you start writing your code to make that test pass
2016-02-16 04:35:27	greduan	once the test passes
2016-02-16 04:35:37	greduan	you refactor if needed and make sure the tests still pass
2016-02-16 04:35:49	greduan	and boom you know everything there is to know about unit testing. lol
2016-02-16 04:35:56	@rocx	yeah. found a neat project idea to "properly" code.
2016-02-16 04:36:11	@rocx	https://redd.it/45gsov
2016-02-16 04:36:37	@rocx	tl;dr someone failed to make a good enough vending machine.
2016-02-16 04:37:06	thlst	unit test is something rust supports out of the box
2016-02-16 04:37:09	thlst	i know you don't like rust
2016-02-16 04:37:12	thlst	but just saying
2016-02-16 04:37:40	@rocx	thlst: you sound just like chc4.
2016-02-16 04:37:48	@rocx	except i think he's also a hoon guy.
2016-02-16 04:38:04	thlst	i don't know chc4 unfortunately
2016-02-16 04:39:11	thlst	i just like rust because it's "good practice by default"
2016-02-16 04:40:24	greduan	I like languages like Go that just say "FUCK YOU THIS IS THE OFFICIAL CODING STYLE GUIDE AND IF YOU DERAIL FROM THIS YOU'RE A DICK"
2016-02-16 04:40:32	greduan	solves the biggest problem JS has
2016-02-16 04:40:46	greduan	which is that every goddamn Joe has his own lib for solving that one thing. lol
2016-02-16 04:40:55	+dcat	any of you guys good with html?
2016-02-16 04:41:11	+dcat	I'm trying to call a cgi script on click of a button
2016-02-16 04:41:19	+dcat	well, three different buttons
2016-02-16 04:41:35	@rocx	so you need to figure out how to make the script call when the button's clicked?
2016-02-16 04:41:43	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:41:57	+dcat	I know how to do it with a submit button and all of that shit
2016-02-16 04:42:22	+dcat	I just don't understand how to do it <input type=button ...
2016-02-16 04:42:32	greduan	you can do two things
2016-02-16 04:42:34	greduan	either
2016-02-16 04:42:43	greduan	onclick="yourfunc();"
2016-02-16 04:42:45	greduan	or
2016-02-16 04:42:46	@rocx	I think that action needs to be a web link to the script, the method needs to be GET.
2016-02-16 04:42:57	+dcat	yes
2016-02-16 04:43:03	+dcat	but then you need a submit button
2016-02-16 04:43:04	greduan	what rocx said
2016-02-16 04:43:06	greduan	or
2016-02-16 04:43:09	greduan	the proper way
2016-02-16 04:43:10	greduan	which is
2016-02-16 04:43:16	@rocx	eg. "<form action="http://dead.cat/dcat-cgi/hello" method="GET"> ... </form>
2016-02-16 04:43:17	@venam	slowest connection ever atm
2016-02-16 04:43:24	@venam	I've never reached that low before
2016-02-16 04:43:33	@venam	and those are the time you can really appreciate irc
2016-02-16 04:43:40	@venam	it's still super fast
2016-02-16 04:43:47	+dcat	venam: my connection is too slow for irc
2016-02-16 04:43:48	@rocx	venam: pfff. i have a lot of times that i'll even lag out of irc.
2016-02-16 04:43:52	greduan	document.getElementById('yoursubmitbutton').on('click',function (e) { /* your AJAX thingy here */ })
2016-02-16 04:44:06	@rocx	whoa nelly man we don't need to get irrational here, greduan.
2016-02-16 04:44:11	+dcat	I usually type out a sentence before it appears
2016-02-16 04:44:18	greduan	rocx: that's the proper way to do it bro
2016-02-16 04:44:26	greduan	usually you use jQuery though
2016-02-16 04:44:27	@rocx	via jabbascript?
2016-02-16 04:44:30	+dcat	greduan: so I would have to use javascript?
2016-02-16 04:44:39	greduan	so $('yoursubmitbutton').on('click', ...)
2016-02-16 04:44:44	greduan	dcat: yes almost undoubtedly
2016-02-16 04:44:49	@rocx	i'm just going by this: http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/Perl/Cgi/forms.html
2016-02-16 04:44:55	greduan	if you want to do it properly at least and you don't have a form
2016-02-16 04:44:59	@venam	rocx: heresy, you don't know
2016-02-16 04:45:02	greduan	if you have a form then you do it the rocx way
2016-02-16 04:45:24	@venam	what can of form do you want?
2016-02-16 04:45:30	@venam	triangle, square, circles
2016-02-16 04:45:33	@venam	I can do them all

2016-02-16 07:56:02	greduan	I feel like if you want to use Atom but think it's too big and slow you should use Emacs. Which is even BIGGER but it's not slower.
2016-02-16 07:56:34	greduan	Emacs is a fucking kitchen sink. Wish somebody just made a minimal Emacs distribution which removed all the kruft and shit
2016-02-16 07:56:38	greduan	like butterfly-mode

2016-02-16 08:00:16	greduan	right
2016-02-16 08:00:18	@rocx	though don't quote me on this, but i remember something about how minimizing cruft is one of the "planned" things.
2016-02-16 08:00:27	@rocx	because there's ELPA.
2016-02-16 08:01:40	greduan	HA
2016-02-16 08:02:41	@rocx	yeah. "planned" ~~ "never gonna happen" if "planned" also includes my definition.
2016-02-16 08:05:39	greduan	all Emacs needs for me to properly consider switching to it is a proper operator and text-object interface
2016-02-16 08:05:47	greduan	and ofc some sensible navigation

2016-02-16 08:57:48	greduan	I think (map + '(1 2 3)) should work
2016-02-16 08:57:53	greduan	that's what my instinct tells me
2016-02-16 08:58:03	@rocx	nope.
2016-02-16 08:58:47	greduan	'+ ?
2016-02-16 08:58:56	greduan	since you're passing + as a value instead of as a func
2016-02-16 08:59:23	@rocx	well, this is CL and not Elisp, but it needs to know what to return.
2016-02-16 08:59:31	@rocx	so (map 'list '+ '(1 2 3))

2016-02-16 10:50:22	greduan	glhf
2016-02-16 10:50:30	@rocx	oh yeah i remember that.
2016-02-16 10:51:37	@rocx	so basically from what i remember what you said earlier today, one of your complaints is how Emacs handles text objects compared to vi. eh?
2016-02-16 10:52:04	@rocx	or what is considered a text object between motions.
2016-02-16 10:52:52	@rocx	what was the logic for 'C-w ip' deleting a paragraph?
2016-02-16 10:55:51	greduan	C-w is the operator
2016-02-16 10:55:54	greduan	delete
2016-02-16 10:56:29	greduan	ip is a text-object for "inside paragraph", i.e. the text of the paragraph. "ap" would be "around paragraph", i.e. the text and the new lines around it
2016-02-16 10:56:48	greduan	and that's it. lol
2016-02-16 10:57:00	arc	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2016-02-16 10:57:02	greduan	in Emacs you can't separate the operator from the text-object
2016-02-16 10:57:05	greduan	rc
2016-02-16 11:02:27	greduan	rocx: ^
2016-02-16 11:02:51	@rocx	rc?
2016-02-16 11:03:00	greduan	no no the things above
2016-02-16 11:03:12	@rocx	Oh.
2016-02-16 11:03:12	greduan	I was doing a joke with arc saying aaaaa and I said rc for aaaa+rc = arc
2016-02-16 11:03:41	@rocx	yeah. the best i can think of is C-w going into a "mode".
2016-02-16 11:03:57	greduan	right
2016-02-16 11:04:03	greduan	that's what it would do
2016-02-16 11:04:06	greduan	so code that up BOY
2016-02-16 11:04:22	@rocx	and then revert to a "normal" mode once the operation is done?
2016-02-16 11:04:27	greduan	ye

2016-02-17 07:13:22	sol	i made 100€, i wouldve had 800 or sth if i hadnt been to lazy to get verified on mtgox before they shut down
2016-02-17 07:13:50	sol	i paid .11BTC for a $6 pizza at the CCC in berlin because I didnt have any cash
2016-02-17 07:14:05	sol	and I knew that the guy who paid in advance was big on mining so we did that
2016-02-17 07:14:30	sol	so yeah 200€ pizza at worst
2016-02-17 07:14:42	sbrg	xero: yeah, srsly, re digitalization of currency.. If I have kids, which is still a few years away if it happens, they would probably never ever see paper money in my hands.. I literally never have cash. we can pay with our mobile phones in stores, so even if I don't have my card it's not even a biggie. 
2016-02-17 07:15:14	sbrg	in fact, the fact that I have to use actual coins to do my laundry in the basement is an annoyance because I never ever have cash. I make special trips to the atm so I can change to coins to do my laundry lol

2016-02-17 07:18:48	sbrg	if my apartment was broken into in the middle of the night and they wanted to take the dishwasher, I would offer up my own body and my girlfriend's life to keep it. i fucking hate doing dishes.

2016-02-17 07:55:43	@rocx	this digital tv movement was a stupid idea.
2016-02-17 07:56:03	@rocx	if your signal was fuzzy on analogue, barely anything was affected.
2016-02-17 07:56:37	@rocx	whereas with digital, no matter how you move the antennas, if your signal's remotely fuzzy, you can expect that weird corruption effect and audio entirely cuts out.
2016-02-17 07:59:10	@rocx	tv's practically pointless at that point.

2016-02-17 08:07:02	@rocx	no. you just have to use a specialized box to convert the signal.
2016-02-17 08:07:17	seth	I know but broadcast TV? Can't you just watch online?
2016-02-17 08:07:24	@rocx	it's an overall pain in the rumpus when you can't get your antennas right.

2016-02-17 15:05:39	@fro	regardless of brand
2016-02-17 15:05:41	ubr47k	unintentionally
2016-02-17 15:05:48	@fro	not sure what you guys are doing to these drives
2016-02-17 15:05:55	ubr47k	24/7 ?
2016-02-17 15:06:20	ubr47k	desktop load not some crazy whacko megafile transfers between disks

2016-02-17 15:07:34	ubr47k	am facing somewhat of a dilemma here
2016-02-17 15:08:40	ubr47k	RAID-1 or backups
2016-02-17 15:09:02	ubr47k	I understand backups are important but do people backup their multimedia n stuff
2016-02-17 15:09:09	ubr47k	movies, music, etc.
2016-02-17 15:09:30	@fro	yes
2016-02-17 15:09:38	@rocx	yeah.
2016-02-17 15:09:43	ubr47k	a 2+ TB backup file?
2016-02-17 15:09:53	@rocx	maybe ~2G.
2016-02-17 15:09:56	ubr47k	keeping snapshots of that size?
2016-02-17 15:10:06	@rocx	just individual files.
2016-02-17 15:10:09	sol	incremental backups?
2016-02-17 15:10:19	sol	i dont backup anything.... have yet to learn my lesson
2016-02-17 15:10:27	sol	though a few drives died on my already
2016-02-17 15:11:00	ubr47k	do bits in a HDD corrupt? much like bitflips in RAM?
2016-02-17 15:12:05	ubr47k	that could be a problem for LUKS+dmcrypt or just file integrity
2016-02-17 15:12:05		[15:12]
2016-02-17 15:12:15	ubr47k	though I suspect it does not happen
2016-02-17 15:12:29	sol	if you are as smart as I am you move your laptop too much and the r/w heads scratch the platters
2016-02-17 15:13:09	ubr47k	sol: my friend would smash the laptop more less around where the touchpad was
2016-02-17 15:13:24	ubr47k	his laptop drive died 3~ times I recall
2016-02-17 15:13:38	ubr47k	turns out the HDD was just below the touchpad
2016-02-17 15:13:52	sol	ubr47k: i strategically didnt suspend my laptop when carrying it around
2016-02-17 15:14:03	sol	turns out the HDD is INSIDE THE LAPTOP
2016-02-17 15:14:28	sol	which apparently gets a few shocks when you set down your laptop in the subway for example
2016-02-17 15:14:54	ubr47k	solid state ftw
2016-02-17 15:15:04	sol	same thing happened with my static iMac too though
2016-02-17 15:15:06	sol	>seagate
2016-02-17 15:15:43	ubr47k	I heard they're getting a lawsuit for the reliabilty problem
2016-02-17 15:19:05	ubr47k	welp, I learned my lesson, another brand
2016-02-17 15:20:05	sol	what happened to yours?
2016-02-17 15:20:30	sol	mine never really broke instantly 
2016-02-17 15:20:46	sol	i just needed to make like 40 boot attempts and then it would just work
2016-02-17 15:20:59	sol	and nothing would break until I turned it off again
2016-02-17 15:24:52	ubr47k	the first drive: windows would report bizarre filesizes for a few files (such as 2e-10323245), refusing to boot at some times
2016-02-17 15:25:27	ubr47k	booting to linux was 50/50 chance it would retrieve meaningful data
2016-02-17 15:25:58	ubr47k	the second drive: not detected in any computer, tried other cables, nada
2016-02-17 15:26:46	ubr47k	the latest one would either take very long times to retrieve a folder, access a file, "not responding" to file explorer, not recognizable by the OS
2016-02-17 15:26:56	ubr47k	etc etc
2016-02-17 15:27:24	ubr47k	they happen with no warning (well, I dont keep an eye on SMART)
2016-02-17 15:27:24		[15:27]
2016-02-17 15:29:58	ubr47k	the latest failure is not as frustrating as the other ones
2016-02-17 15:30:32	ubr47k	it was just a drive to store steam games so meh, nothing of value was lost
2016-02-17 15:31:02	ubr47k	except maybe it will take around 1 week to redownload at the current amazing 1.1MB/s internet DL speed

2016-02-18 09:52:17	@xero	but i agree w/ rocx

2016-02-18 09:59:20	@xero	maybe take a look at a project that spesifically does that
2016-02-18 09:59:23	@xero	like https://github.com/NickStrupat/Aligned
2016-02-18 10:00:20	@rocx	C++ is really confusing to read. it's verbose AND cryptic.
2016-02-18 10:00:29	@xero	fyr: see if whoever "nick strupat" is, was running his own gitserver i would have not found it in 0.5 seconds
2016-02-18 10:00:38	@xero	that's part of what i like about a big site like gh
2016-02-18 10:00:49	@xero	rocx: i agree.
2016-02-18 10:00:57	kirby	As in I don't think I get the theory because that readme isn't making a huge deal of sense (though I am quite tired tbh), thanks anyway though.
2016-02-18 10:00:58	@rocx	is that it's almost the status quo for software hosting now?
2016-02-18 10:01:11	kirby	And C++ isn't that bad, templates are a bit weird to read though.

2016-02-18 12:51:26	sol	it takes over port 80 and 443 by default
2016-02-18 12:51:27	%vypr	you don't have to, nor are required
2016-02-18 12:51:37	%vypr	that's because the average user doesn't use port 80 or 443

2016-02-18 18:31:11	@z3bra	plain-mode ?
2016-02-18 18:31:32	boobah	just the all-black stuff that i've seen in all your recent stuff
2016-02-18 18:32:02	boobah	'plain-mode' looks like an emacs mode :P
2016-02-18 18:32:02		[18:32]
2016-02-18 18:32:24	@z3bra	that's the default version of software
2016-02-18 18:32:52	@z3bra	the thing is
2016-02-18 18:32:54	boobah	still though..
2016-02-18 18:33:17	@z3bra	when you start "ricing" you never stop
2016-02-18 18:33:37	boobah	you stopped. others have stagnated as well, including myself.
2016-02-18 18:34:02	@z3bra	I could have kept my last setup, but at some I'd be like "ok, maybe I could just change this or that"
2016-02-18 18:34:09	@z3bra	and I'll start ricing again
2016-02-18 18:34:14	@z3bra	I don't want that
2016-02-18 18:34:16	boobah	oh
2016-02-18 18:34:22	boobah	work to do, right? :)
2016-02-18 18:34:34	@z3bra	well yeah kinda
2016-02-18 18:35:04	@z3bra	I decided that "sane default" is better than "fully customized" :)
2016-02-18 18:35:20	@z3bra	so from now on, I'll only customized what I need
2016-02-18 18:35:25	boobah	pretty hardcore, but i guess i see where you're coming from
2016-02-18 18:35:43	@z3bra	it's not that hardcode to be fair
2016-02-18 18:36:07	boobah	it is if you're using *all* defaults
2016-02-18 18:36:24	boobah	also tbh, sometimes it's just nice to have something pretty to look at.
2016-02-18 18:36:34	boobah	i'm sure you know that
2016-02-18 18:36:37	@z3bra	not it's not
2016-02-18 18:36:49	@z3bra	you'd be surprised how efficient softwares are by default
2016-02-18 18:37:21	@z3bra	and yeah, even if it's nice to look at, you get usedto terse looks
2016-02-18 18:37:58	boobah	ehhh... to a certain extent. for example, having to type out ':tabe' is objectively worse than hitting, say <C-t> that you mapped
2016-02-18 18:38:23	@z3bra	you don't need tabedit :)
2016-02-18 18:38:33	boobah	just an example bruh
2016-02-18 18:38:47	@z3bra	sure
2016-02-18 18:38:49	boobah	replace with whatever buffer manipulation commands
2016-02-18 18:39:24	boobah	i guess you still use wmutils, so that's cool
2016-02-18 18:39:28	@z3bra	sorry but I've been using the default vi keybinds for monthes without problem
2016-02-18 18:39:39	@z3bra	sure I do
2016-02-18 18:39:46	@z3bra	I wrote it for me in the first place :P
2016-02-18 18:39:53	boobah	yup, i remember :P
2016-02-18 18:40:30	boobah	it's not there's a *problem* with default keybinds, but the possibility for more efficient customizations is significant
2016-02-18 18:41:00	@z3bra	yeah
2016-02-18 18:41:00	boobah	i used traditional vi(1) for the entire year of 2014 pretty much
2016-02-18 18:41:14	boobah	but i work a lot faster now, even after i had gotten used to the plain stuff
2016-02-18 18:41:19	@z3bra	but if you go down this route, you'll start adding more and more keybinds
2016-02-18 18:41:34	boobah	sometimes visual-block is 10x faster than typing out a regex
2016-02-18 18:41:34	@z3bra	and end up spending more time customizing your vimrc than actually using it
2016-02-18 18:41:44	@z3bra	that's why I stopped using vim
2016-02-18 18:42:02	boobah	all that's needed is a bit of self control. here, lemme run a stat(1) on my vimrc to see the last time i touched it
2016-02-18 18:42:41	boobah	2 months? and i switched back to vim 3 months ago. so that's really not bad at all.
2016-02-18 18:43:51	@z3bra	if you can control yourself, that's cool
2016-02-18 18:43:56	@z3bra	I can't myself
2016-02-18 18:43:58	boobah	:)
2016-02-18 18:44:03	boobah	if you say so
2016-02-18 18:44:04	@z3bra	so default it is!
2016-02-18 18:44:29	boobah	what editor are you using now? last time we talked you were saying how it was hard to keep up with vis commits
2016-02-18 18:44:37	@z3bra	and I'm pretty happy
2016-02-18 18:44:42	@z3bra	I'm using it though
2016-02-18 18:44:59	boobah	lol, as long as you're happy, man!
2016-02-18 18:45:06	@z3bra	the hard thing was that every commit was breaking the config.h compatibility
2016-02-18 18:45:20	boobah	that's actually a lot more important than being 100% efficient or whatever
2016-02-18 18:45:21	@z3bra	so I decided to use the default one
2016-02-18 18:45:36	@z3bra	and now I'm 100% efficient :P
2016-02-18 18:45:45	boobah	nice :D
2016-02-18 18:46:58	boobah	still using crux, maintaining ports?
2016-02-18 18:47:02	@z3bra	yup
2016-02-18 18:47:02		[18:47]
2016-02-18 18:47:08	@z3bra	not maintaining ports much though
2016-02-18 18:47:15	boobah	that sounds like such a time sink, dunno how you guys do it
2016-02-18 18:47:18	@z3bra	too busy with the distro
2016-02-18 18:47:34	@z3bra	well, updating git-based ports is as easy as
2016-02-18 18:47:42	@z3bra	upthemall
2016-02-18 18:47:44	@z3bra	:P
2016-02-18 18:47:57	@z3bra	then git add/commit/push
2016-02-18 18:48:10	@z3bra	for the others, ell, I update them as neded
2016-02-18 18:48:13	@z3bra	needed
2016-02-18 18:48:18	boobah	can't wait to see how that all goes. i want to experiment with some of that stuff myself, but i don't have the time currently
2016-02-18 18:48:39	@z3bra	I finally got gcc static packed and working :)
2016-02-18 18:48:50	@z3bra	so I'll soon be able to bootstrap my distro
2016-02-18 18:48:55	@z3bra	that'll be neat
2016-02-18 18:48:58	@z3bra	(I hope)
2016-02-18 18:49:01	boobah	whoa, mind running a `du -k` on it for me?
2016-02-18 18:49:13	boobah	curious how big a static gcc is
2016-02-18 18:49:36	@z3bra	3.4M    /ns/pm/rootfs/bin/gcc
2016-02-18 18:49:55	boobah	not bad! of course, you'd need the libs to compile useful stuff, but that's awesome!
2016-02-18 18:50:11	@z3bra	it only supports C though
2016-02-18 18:50:23	boobah	who needs c++ :P
2016-02-18 18:50:26	@z3bra	389M    /ns/pm/rootfs/
2016-02-18 18:50:29	boobah	`/ns` == "network share"?
2016-02-18 18:50:32	@z3bra	that's the whole distro
2016-02-18 18:50:36	@z3bra	namespace
2016-02-18 18:50:41	boobah	oh
2016-02-18 18:50:49	boobah	ie. the chroot
2016-02-18 18:51:16	@z3bra	yeah
2016-02-18 18:51:20	@z3bra	going to work
2016-02-18 18:51:23	@z3bra	maybe later :)
2016-02-18 18:51:25	@z3bra	cheers
2016-02-18 18:51:30	boobah	seeya :)

2016-02-19 03:32:37	asdf	when you say pure, it's really pure, like, everything is a function

2016-02-19 03:35:12	@xero	JavaScript, Lua[46] and Python had first class functions from their inception
2016-02-19 03:35:13	@rocx	i mean would it be a valuable skill to have since there's no sign of the JVM going away.

2016-02-19 03:35:36	@xero	but you have to write your code with 1st class functions
2016-02-19 03:35:37	%adam	i did
2016-02-19 03:35:42	@xero	it's how the language is designed
2016-02-19 03:35:49	@xero	so by definition, it's a functional language

2016-02-19 03:37:16	@xero	correct
2016-02-19 03:37:30	@xero	purescript is a port of js that makes it more so
2016-02-19 03:37:34	jona	nobody gives a shit if its pure or not. i love the process-oriented paradigm in erlang
2016-02-19 03:37:48	jona	multi-paradigm languages are the best

2016-02-19 04:59:24	@rocx	basically it's just a different origin point. whereas graphics normally have origin at the top-left, cartesian coordinates tend to be bottom-left or center.

2016-02-19 05:00:09	@z3bra	that would require complex tools

2016-02-19 05:19:50	@z3bra	thlst, so you don't have "exec 2bwm" at the bottom
2016-02-19 05:20:15	thlst	dcat: hsetroot
2016-02-19 05:20:21	thlst	it's a generated script
2016-02-19 05:22:19	thlst	funny, it worked
2016-02-19 05:22:23	thlst	(exec 2bwm)
2016-02-19 05:22:27	thlst	that's fucking weird
2016-02-19 05:23:35	dcat	how odd
2016-02-19 05:24:18	@z3bra	lol, that's not fuccny
2016-02-19 05:24:20	@z3bra	funny
2016-02-19 05:24:28	@z3bra	that's how it is supposed to behave :)
2016-02-19 05:24:36	@z3bra	maybe you wrote something like
2016-02-19 05:24:39	@z3bra	exec 2bwm &
2016-02-19 05:24:54	thlst	i don't remember
2016-02-19 05:25:18	dcat	brotip for all of you that have missed this in xinitrc
2016-02-19 05:25:18		[05:25]
2016-02-19 05:25:39	dcat	you wanna start your wm /before/ running some of the programs in xinitrc
2016-02-19 05:25:47	dcat	my_wm &
2016-02-19 05:25:50	dcat	[...]
2016-02-19 05:25:52	dcat	wait %1
2016-02-19 05:26:16	@xero	i always start my daemons like mpd before the wm
2016-02-19 05:26:20	@xero	any reason why not to?
2016-02-19 05:26:30	dcat	no
2016-02-19 05:26:44	dcat	mpd has nothing to do with X, so you're safe
2016-02-19 05:28:20	dcat	there's so many overlooked shell functions
2016-02-19 05:28:34	dcat	I mostly use a single term for programming
2016-02-19 05:28:41	dcat	vi pgm.c

2016-02-19 05:29:56	@rocx	f?
2016-02-19 05:29:59	dcat	oh yeah
2016-02-19 05:30:03	dcat	I alias f=fg
2016-02-19 05:30:09	dcat	cause I'm lazy as fuuuuuu
2016-02-19 05:30:14	@rocx	ah.
2016-02-19 05:30:22	@xero	i use a lot of watchers for my code, (and most web stuff is not compiled) so when i :w it just sends the update ping to my app runners and everything reloads w/o closing vim
2016-02-19 05:30:55	@rocx	kind of not too fond of jekyll right now.
2016-02-19 05:31:07	dcat	I used to use vim-dispatch
2016-02-19 05:31:15	dcat	but my fucking god is that a shitty solution
2016-02-19 05:31:24	@xero	grunt watch
2016-02-19 05:31:25	@rocx	it just feels like a lot of tracing through templates and heck, the jekyll site doesn't quite have a link to the Liquid templating.
2016-02-19 05:31:45	@rocx	dcat: you use vis or nvi now, right?
2016-02-19 05:32:00	dcat	nvi
2016-02-19 05:32:06	@rocx	ah. still. just curious.
2016-02-19 05:32:16	@xero	he uses the gui neovim
2016-02-19 05:32:17	dcat	or vim when I'm lazy and want colors
2016-02-19 05:32:19	@xero	dont let him lie to you

2016-02-19 05:33:18	dcat	right now I'm using vim
2016-02-19 05:33:26	dcat	cause without syntax highlighting I'd be lost as fuck
2016-02-19 05:33:38	@xero	<3333
2016-02-19 05:33:48	dcat	also
2016-02-19 05:33:55	@z3bra	honestly, it's not *that* bad without syntax hl
2016-02-19 05:33:57	dcat	that suckless or cat-v thing about syntax highlighting
2016-02-19 05:34:03	@rocx	aiju.
2016-02-19 05:34:12	dcat	oh yeah
2016-02-19 05:34:20	@rocx	it's a constraint thing as well as the 80char rule in code though.
2016-02-19 05:34:31	@z3bra	indeed
2016-02-19 05:34:33	@rocx	if your code's too hard too read without colors, it's probably too jumbled.
2016-02-19 05:34:43	@z3bra	that's a good point
2016-02-19 05:35:05	@rocx	i just use a few tints of white. darkened comments help.
2016-02-19 05:35:11	dcat	nah
2016-02-19 05:35:14	dcat	its just cocoa
2016-02-19 05:35:26	%adam	i use ms word
2016-02-19 05:35:29	@xero	u can read json (for instance) but it's WAY easier w/ highlighting
2016-02-19 05:35:38	@rocx	YAML > JSON.
2016-02-19 05:35:41	@rocx	jus' sayin'.
2016-02-19 05:35:50	@xero	rocx: i dont get to pick at work
2016-02-19 05:35:51	dcat	isn't json stricter?
2016-02-19 05:36:12	@xero	sometimes you have to do what "the boss" says if you want to get paid
2016-02-19 05:36:31	%adam	The Man.
2016-02-19 05:36:32	@xero	json is super strict. but with linters it's easy]

2016-02-19 05:43:46	dcat	how is it different from `at`?
2016-02-19 05:45:40	@xero	nq != at
2016-02-19 05:45:59	dcat	I can't be bothered to read the README
2016-02-19 05:46:04	dcat	can you give me a tl;dr?
2016-02-19 05:48:03	@z3bra	you "enqueue" commands
2016-02-19 05:48:08	@z3bra	as in, stack them
2016-02-19 05:48:15	@z3bra	and then pop them out
2016-02-19 05:48:31	dcat	so job ctl?
2016-02-19 05:48:45	@z3bra	more like
2016-02-19 05:48:54	@z3bra	cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3
2016-02-19 05:49:00	@z3bra	could be rewritten as

2016-02-19 05:49:03	@z3bra	nq cmd2

2016-02-19 05:49:07	@z3bra	fq
2016-02-19 05:49:17	@z3bra	it seems
2016-02-19 05:49:22	dcat	ah
2016-02-19 05:49:25	@rocx	nacquound and forequound
2016-02-19 05:49:41	@z3bra	nq == enqueue (when pronounced)
2016-02-19 05:49:43	dcat	guys
2016-02-19 05:49:46	dcat	I just had a memory
2016-02-19 05:49:53	thlst	http://i.imgur.com/Iuq50k2.png
2016-02-19 05:49:54	dcat	I remember when I was in high school
2016-02-19 05:50:04	dcat	I was so afraid whenever I put on my headset
2016-02-19 05:50:24	dcat	that I would make a whistle sound when I was breathing
2016-02-19 05:50:25	%adam	thlst: looks good
2016-02-19 05:50:39	dcat	so I took off one ear of my headset at all times
2016-02-19 05:51:00	thlst	adam: ty
2016-02-19 05:51:02	@xero	thlst++
2016-02-19 05:51:03	dcat	so I could notice if I was whistling
2016-02-19 05:51:13	@xero	dcat: where you ever?
2016-02-19 05:51:20	dcat	I don't know
2016-02-19 05:51:22	dcat	I think so
2016-02-19 05:51:47	dcat	I just remembered cause it's making that sound now
2016-02-19 05:51:56	dcat	which is really weird
2016-02-19 05:51:56	@rocx	these headphones are sound-unproofed that you could hear the floor creaking down the stairs.
2016-02-19 05:51:57	@xero	thlst: some of those colors are pretty kark though. you're wall is way lighter and it kinda offset my eyes a bit
2016-02-19 05:52:08	dcat	cause I was never worried about being embarrased
2016-02-19 05:52:26	dcat	I would pull my dick out in front of the teacher and do the helicopter
2016-02-19 05:52:29	dcat	no shame
2016-02-19 05:52:38	kirby	Whoah there
2016-02-19 05:52:39	@xero	dcat: was it more fear of something wrong them maybe?
2016-02-19 05:52:42	dcat	but god forbid I ever made a whistling sound with my nose
2016-02-19 05:52:50	thlst	xero: when it's day (sun light) i keep wallpapers lighty
2016-02-19 05:52:58	dcat	no idea
2016-02-19 05:53:16	@rocx	yeah i definitely need a wallpaper with time-of-day themes.
2016-02-19 05:53:29	@rocx	or just a cron job to change them based on the day.
2016-02-19 05:53:39	@rocx	a timepaper.
2016-02-19 05:53:42	%adam	theres a nice 8-bit landscape pack
2016-02-19 05:53:43	@xero	i wrote a script a while ago that basically did that
2016-02-19 05:53:45	%adam	somewhere
2016-02-19 05:53:48	@xero	but with solid colors
2016-02-19 05:54:02	@xero	hourly cron that darkended it
2016-02-19 05:54:12	@xero	hrm... i wonder if i still have it
2016-02-19 05:54:18	@rocx	adam: 8-bit == full color but every square's 3-4px large and resolution might change.
2016-02-19 05:55:45	thlst	when night, i set a dark tiling wallpaper
2016-02-19 05:56:02	dcat	anyone familiar with gdb/lldb?
2016-02-19 05:57:41	paul	what's the problem officer?
2016-02-19 05:59:31	greduan	paul: you say "what seems to be the problem, officer?"
2016-02-19 05:59:31		[05:59]
2016-02-19 05:59:45	greduan	that way you separate yourself even more from the scene
2016-02-19 06:00:01	%adam	what seems to be the officer, problem?
2016-02-19 06:00:09	@rocx	 we have a problem officer?
2016-02-19 06:00:20	@rocx	i vote someone for our official officer of problems.
2016-02-19 06:00:38	thlst	xero: what is 'kark'?
2016-02-19 06:00:45	@rocx	also, screw it, i'm giving Racket a look.

2016-02-19 06:12:15	dcat	I guess I only need to invert the Y axis

2016-02-19 06:13:19	dcat	but aqua doesn't report anything

2016-02-19 06:23:08	@z3bra	dcat, yep, X axis only
2016-02-19 06:23:35	@z3bra	depending on how windows coordinates are set, perhaps substract the height too

2016-02-20 01:26:34	arc	yes

2016-02-20 01:26:44	arc	xquartz
2016-02-20 01:26:44	dcat	yes
2016-02-20 01:26:54	dcat	you don't need xquartz

2016-02-20 01:27:46	storm	I don't really care about the looks
2016-02-20 01:27:57	storm	all that much functionaliy matters more tbqh
2016-02-20 01:28:16	dcat	then osx is for you
2016-02-20 01:28:55	arc	question of the day
2016-02-20 01:29:02	arc	should i install openbsd
2016-02-20 01:29:13	kirby	Everyone is going to say yes.
2016-02-20 01:29:15	dcat	on what?
2016-02-20 01:29:16	storm	dcat: but I heard brew is missing a lot of libraries and packages
2016-02-20 01:29:21	arc	my laptop
2016-02-20 01:29:25	kirby	I'm going to say check hardware compatability at least first.
2016-02-20 01:29:33	dcat	what hardware does your laptop have?
2016-02-20 01:29:33	arc	it's compatible

2016-02-20 01:30:51	storm	dcat: What can I use that would be similar to wmutils? on osx
2016-02-20 01:31:04	arc	probably something like hammerspoon maybe
2016-02-20 01:31:15	dcat	storm: osx comes with applescript
2016-02-20 01:31:30	dcat	which lets you control GUI through commandline
2016-02-20 01:32:04	storm	ooohhh sounds nice
2016-02-20 01:32:08	dcat	arc: I would install openbsd or netbsd
2016-02-20 01:32:20	storm	arc: why did you post your mac address ;_;

2016-02-20 02:20:11	%adam	heres the verbose scale
2016-02-20 02:20:11	chc4	point me at some ugly code in gallium

2016-02-20 02:21:18	%adam	that took me longer to notice than id like to admit
2016-02-20 02:21:19	chc4	it is
2016-02-20 02:21:21	chc4	this is true
2016-02-20 02:22:14	chc4	rust is nice though. it's like C that holds you hand so you can't fuck up and write exploitable code and make computers terrible
2016-02-20 02:22:25	thlst	i'm using more c++ (because specialization) though, but rust really made me a better programmer
2016-02-20 02:22:31	%vypr	the only thing rust has going is memory-safety

2016-02-20 02:22:49	%adam	look man
2016-02-20 02:22:52	%adam	when were talkin about rust
2016-02-20 02:22:52	%vypr	thlst: does rust have fp?
2016-02-20 02:22:54	%adam	nothing is serious
2016-02-20 02:23:01	%vypr	thlst: *shrug*

2016-02-20 02:26:16	seth	xero that's great
2016-02-20 02:26:34	thlst	also, the way rust separates data from functions, that is really good
2016-02-20 02:26:56	thlst	i mean, there is no oop like classes, inheritance etc
2016-02-20 02:27:02	@xero	i agree that it has a lot of great features to help devs not fall into classic pitfalls
2016-02-20 02:27:17	@xero	but it's obsurd to say any technology protects you 100% and is future proof
2016-02-20 02:27:27	%vypr	i would use C an assload more if it had oop normally implemented
2016-02-20 02:27:33	%vypr	i don't mean going as far as C++ would with oop
2016-02-20 02:27:35	thlst	what? no, rust doesn't protect you from shooting your foot
2016-02-20 02:27:41	%vypr	but just classes with polymorphism
2016-02-20 02:27:42	%vypr	and i'd be fine
2016-02-20 02:27:49	@z3bra	C doesn't have oop implemented at all

2016-02-20 02:42:42	fyr	does it have a url grabber patch?
2016-02-20 02:42:43	arc	it's a nice terminal
2016-02-20 02:42:44	@z3bra	so the xurls script should extract URLs from this "term dump"

2016-02-20 10:38:15	%vypr	also very few distros have secure boot support

2016-02-20 10:45:46	greduan	cya
2016-02-20 10:46:03	greduan	man all he really needs to know is how to sit still doing nothing for 3 hours straight and he goes off and reads shit
2016-02-20 10:46:15	greduan	just *BE* there comfortably
2016-02-20 10:46:20	greduan	that's ALL meditation is
2016-02-20 10:46:23	greduan	or should be IMO
2016-02-20 10:46:33	t0b1nux	Don't get me wrong, they are excellent IRC clients out there, but I would like to see SSL by default for such a mature protocol
2016-02-20 10:46:43	greduan	I can meditate for 3 hours straight, no problem, I can take you any day, fite me
2016-02-20 10:46:55	%vypr	greduan: i don't think you get it mate
2016-02-20 10:47:27	%vypr	its not as black and white as it seems
2016-02-20 10:47:28	greduan	I get it more than you :P

2016-02-20 10:47:34	greduan	no but seriously
2016-02-20 10:47:35	greduan	sorry
2016-02-20 10:47:38	greduan	but seriously
2016-02-20 10:47:41	greduan	what do you do when you meditate?
2016-02-20 10:47:47	%vypr	focus on breath
2016-02-20 10:47:49	%vypr	anapanasati
2016-02-20 10:48:01	%vypr	(trans. 'mindfulness of breath')
2016-02-20 10:48:16	%vypr	as well as vipassana
2016-02-20 10:48:20	%vypr	which is insight meditation
2016-02-20 10:48:30	greduan	ic
2016-02-20 10:48:41	%vypr	the final one i do is metta meditation
2016-02-20 10:48:59	%vypr	which involves cultivating compassion and all that jazz
2016-02-20 10:49:06	greduan	see the meditation I do is way simpler. it's literally just sit there comfortably. you don't need to think about anything or be mindful of anything, just sit there.
2016-02-20 10:49:19	%vypr	...right.
2016-02-20 10:49:24	%vypr	i don't think that's meditation
2016-02-20 10:49:31	%vypr	that sounds like sitting
2016-02-20 10:49:37	greduan	sitting yeah, it's great
2016-02-20 10:49:43	%vypr	go home
2016-02-20 10:50:41	%adam	question
2016-02-20 10:50:44	%vypr	adam: sup
2016-02-20 10:50:52	ygstr	What's a good tech movie
2016-02-20 10:50:58	%adam	should i buy adamdrinkstoomuch.vodka or adamdrinkstoomuch.beer
2016-02-20 10:50:58		[10:50]
2016-02-20 10:51:06	%vypr	adam: beer
2016-02-20 10:51:15	%adam	see i was thinkin beer too cause its easier to drin
2016-02-20 10:51:23	%adam	but in reality i do drink a lot of vodka
2016-02-20 10:51:49	%adam	i may go with beer since its like
2016-02-20 10:51:56	%adam	the coca cola of alcoholic beverages
2016-02-20 10:52:35	%vypr	greduan: btw buddhism is much more than meditation
2016-02-20 10:52:39	tm512	vodka is the water of alcoholic beverages. boring.
2016-02-20 10:52:52	%adam	bro vodka gets me way more outta it
2016-02-20 10:54:21	tm512	still a boring thing to drink. beer has flavor and complexity
2016-02-20 10:54:27	tm512	well, good beer anyway
2016-02-20 10:55:02	greduan	vypr: I imagine.
2016-02-20 10:55:16	greduan	BTW vypr you're not the only weird one. I'm a Scientologist. :P
2016-02-20 10:55:28	%adam	whats up, tom cruise
2016-02-20 10:55:49	greduan	nah nah nah
2016-02-20 10:55:59	greduan	Tom Cruise is in the Church of Scientology.
2016-02-20 10:56:12	greduan	Scientology is just a label they put on themselves, they don't teach or apply Scientology
2016-02-20 10:56:33	%adam	my close minded american mind is incapable of understanding
2016-02-20 10:56:46	%adam	wait while i consume more cheeseburgers to contemplat
2016-02-20 10:56:49	%adam	okay
2016-02-20 10:56:51	%adam	i swear
2016-02-20 10:56:56	%adam	i my keyboard is not broken
2016-02-20 10:57:03	%adam	i just forget to hit the last letter in a sentence
2016-02-20 10:57:16	greduan	last time I visited a Church of Scientology was in... 207
2016-02-20 10:57:18	greduan	2007*
2016-02-20 10:57:52	greduan	wasn't hard to get out since I wasn't paying them millions for them to fuck me over as a being
2016-02-20 10:58:01	greduan	lol
2016-02-20 10:58:31	greduan	Afterwards I've just been out in the Ron's Org, which is part of the freezone, i.e. Scientology outside of the Church of Scientology.
2016-02-20 10:58:37	greduan	and that concludes my religious background
2016-02-20 10:58:47	%adam	thats cool
2016-02-20 10:58:50	%adam	mines kinda like
2016-02-20 10:59:07	%adam	i was raised catholic and firmly believed in my faith until i started drinking
2016-02-20 10:59:15	tm512	lol
2016-02-20 10:59:45	tm512	I was raised in a way that allowed me to come to my own conclusions about reality
2016-02-20 10:59:53	greduan	^^
2016-02-20 11:00:09	tm512	so I guess I feel lucky in that respect, since it seems like you guys didn't get that
2016-02-20 11:00:29	greduan	I did, they just told me some stuff and as I grew up I checked it out for myself
2016-02-20 11:00:43	%adam	i never did but
2016-02-20 11:01:01	%adam	i never cared much to figure it out myself until i got outta my hometown
2016-02-20 11:01:12	greduan	One thing that in the Church they don't properly apply, but is taken very seriously in the Ron's Org, is that "if it's real for you, it's real for you, if it's not real for you, it's not real for you"
2016-02-20 11:01:19	arc	hello i have a cellphone in my mouth
2016-02-20 11:01:26	greduan	arc: how are you typing?
2016-02-20 11:01:29	greduan	theory debunked
2016-02-20 11:01:32	arc	my computer
2016-02-20 11:01:37	greduan	fuck
2016-02-20 11:02:00	tm512	just from an early age I realized how much religion and spirituality conflicted with science, logic, and reality
2016-02-20 11:02:12	greduan	anyway that's the whole thing about Scientology, if something is real for you it's real for you, if it isn't it isn't, and that's that. they won't try to convince you or anything.
2016-02-20 11:02:41	greduan	tm512: Spirituality doesn't conflict with science, logic and reality IMO. Since for me spirituality IS reality.
2016-02-20 11:02:47	greduan	like
2016-02-20 11:02:53	greduan	yeah you've a body, who doesn't
2016-02-20 11:03:00	tm512	and I think you're delusional believing that
2016-02-20 11:03:05	tm512	no offense, just honesty
2016-02-20 11:03:36	greduan	for me it just seems like evolution, as it is presented, is a fucking way too intelligent machine for it to not have some sort of intelligent force behind it.
2016-02-20 11:03:42	greduan	intelligence only exists in life.
2016-02-20 11:03:51	greduan	like
2016-02-20 11:03:53	greduan	OK the heard
2016-02-20 11:03:55	greduan	heart*
2016-02-20 11:03:59	greduan	have you seen how that shit works?
2016-02-20 11:04:16	greduan	that is WAAAAAAY too complex for something with virtually no intelligence, like evolution, to EVER figure out
2016-02-20 11:04:25	ygstr	greduan: looking for a good laptop now
2016-02-20 11:04:27	tm512	evolution has been working on life for billions of years
2016-02-20 11:04:41	tm512	this complexity arose gradually
2016-02-20 11:04:43	greduan	ygstr: cool
2016-02-20 11:05:00	tm512	over a scale of time that our brains are really really bad at comprehending
2016-02-20 11:05:05	greduan	tm512: it's still WAAY to random and dumb for me to believe that there wasn't an intelligent force behind it.
2016-02-20 11:05:12	tm512	it's not random
2016-02-20 11:05:21	tm512	it's chemistry
2016-02-20 11:05:28	greduan	evolution is random
2016-02-20 11:05:29	tm512	and biology
2016-02-20 11:05:34	tm512	no, it's not random
2016-02-20 11:05:38	%adam	it does actually make a lot of sense, scientifically
2016-02-20 11:05:42	%adam	how we came about
2016-02-20 11:05:46	greduan	evolution is literally "whoever didn't die, gets to reproduce and adapt further"
2016-02-20 11:05:59	tm512	that is the opposite of random greduan 
2016-02-20 11:05:59		[11:05]
2016-02-20 11:06:18	greduan	tm512: I'm talking about way before that, I'm talking about before a thing like a "heart" ever came about
2016-02-20 11:06:20	tm512	the only traits that get passed on are positive or neutral in terms of impact on reproduction
2016-02-20 11:06:23	greduan	a heart is a fucking complex machine.
2016-02-20 11:06:29	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:06:35	tm512	and a billion years is a really fucking long time
2016-02-20 11:06:49	greduan	you know what's longer? trillions. :P
2016-02-20 11:07:04	tm512	your point?
2016-02-20 11:07:11	greduan	none, hence the :P
2016-02-20 11:07:17	tm512	so why bother saying it
2016-02-20 11:07:24	greduan	cause it came to my mind. lol
2016-02-20 11:07:37	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:07:48	greduan	I'm not saying science is wrong
2016-02-20 11:07:53	tm512	you are
2016-02-20 11:07:55	greduan	I find fascinating the stuff people find
2016-02-20 11:08:15	greduan	people = scientists
2016-02-20 11:08:31	tm512	rejecting evolution means you only accept science when it doesn't conflict with your preexisting belief system
2016-02-20 11:08:47	greduan	I just think they are somewhat blinded by the fact they've completely taken spirituality out of the whole equation of this universe. Even though shit tons of stuff would make sense if you include it.
2016-02-20 11:08:55	tm512	so have fun with your cognitive dissonance
2016-02-20 11:09:36	tm512	there is no evidence that spirits exist, so science has no business considering it
2016-02-20 11:10:20	greduan	BTW I'm not OK with evolution as it is presented. I did not say we did not evolve. I just believe, and this is my own belief, that evolution was engineered. I.e. somebody decided "all right this planet looks good, hey guys start working on those humanoid things, but first put some bacteria in there, get some oxygen in there"
2016-02-20 11:10:44	greduan	I.e. aliens.
2016-02-20 11:10:48	tm512	and where did that "somebody" come from?
2016-02-20 11:10:53	greduan	But hey aliens haven't been proven either right?
2016-02-20 11:10:55	tm512	you're just pushing the problem back further
2016-02-20 11:11:31	greduan	This universe is way way way way way way way way way fucking WAAAAAY too fucking WAAAY older than scientists believe it to be. lol
2016-02-20 11:11:41	tm512	where is your evidence?
2016-02-20 11:11:43	greduan	if you look at it that way, very likely that we were put here.
2016-02-20 11:11:57	greduan	my recollections on the matter?
2016-02-20 11:12:04	tm512	that's not evidence
2016-02-20 11:12:08	greduan	it is for me son
2016-02-20 11:12:12	%adam	HEYO
2016-02-20 11:12:30	greduan	if you suddenly recall that you were a viking at some point, it sure as hell is real for you that you were a viking, no?
2016-02-20 11:12:31	tm512	you don't get to define what evidence is for everyone else
2016-02-20 11:12:31	%adam	BADA BING WIT A PIPE
2016-02-20 11:12:58	greduan	adam: don't worry this argument is fun for me. Cause I ain't trying to change his opinion and I ain't changing mine. I'm just stating my opinion.
2016-02-20 11:13:03	tm512	greduan: no, I'd probably go to get my head checked
2016-02-20 11:13:15	greduan	tm512: and get drugged and shit and die? sad life bro. lol
2016-02-20 11:13:16	%adam	greduan: vodka
2016-02-20 11:13:50	greduan	but hey you'll get another shot at it whenever you feel like it so death ain't that bad, but it sure is bad when it happens. lol
2016-02-20 11:14:16	tm512	well, my death is inevitable
2016-02-20 11:14:24	greduan	as is my body's
2016-02-20 11:14:28	tm512	and if I was having delusions that were bothering me, I'd probably accept the drugs
2016-02-20 11:14:53	greduan	oh I've no delusions bothering me atm
2016-02-20 11:15:02	greduan	or ever really
2016-02-20 11:15:17	greduan	if the "delusion" happened, it happened I accept it and move on. lol
2016-02-20 11:15:26	tm512	right, you're accepting of your delusions
2016-02-20 11:15:49	greduan	what other thing is there to do?
2016-02-20 11:15:51	greduan	reject them?
2016-02-20 11:16:06	tm512	if you care about logic and reason, yes
2016-02-20 11:16:46	greduan	a delusion is just that, a delusion. they happen. it's like when you think your SO is cheating on you, that's a delusion until proven (hard hard proof), yet we accept that as logic. lol
2016-02-20 11:17:40	tm512	a delusion is not just a suspicion
2016-02-20 11:17:59	greduan	many times people go ape shit over a suspicion. lol

2016-02-20 11:19:11	tm512	too bad for you
2016-02-20 11:19:29	tm512	the only thing I'm confused about is how you've arrived at what you believe in
2016-02-20 11:19:51	greduan	what part of it? most of it was through coming to my own conclussions after being given data.
2016-02-20 11:20:20	greduan	like for example
2016-02-20 11:20:44	greduan	the thing that I am a spiritual being, what in Scn we call a "thetan", that was taught to me as a child and I accepted it, seemed only logical to me at the time.
2016-02-20 11:20:46	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:31	greduan	I learnt other stuff, like past lives and how you're not your body, you're just stuck to it, those things. I accepted those on the basis that I am a thetan so that only makes sense.
2016-02-20 11:21:31		[11:21]
2016-02-20 11:21:33	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:38	ygstr	o lord
2016-02-20 11:21:44	ygstr	what have I missed
2016-02-20 11:21:46	greduan	let me finish lol
2016-02-20 11:21:55	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:21:58	tm512	except the soul is just a construct of our own minds
2016-02-20 11:22:04	greduan	shuuuush, let me finish
2016-02-20 11:22:05	tm512	not a fact of reality
2016-02-20 11:22:06	greduan	then
2016-02-20 11:23:58	tm512	this concept of an "I" that "inhabits" a body is just an illusion. fact is that the brain/nervous system is as much a part of the body as anything else and when the body dies so does the concept of "I" that the brain constructs
2016-02-20 11:24:21	tm512	dualism is complete bullshit
2016-02-20 11:24:44	greduan	then I got audited a bit, and I say audited, they didn't do mind control or any of what you guys probably consider auditing. I literally just sat in front of an auditor, and that auditor told me "give me that hand", and I gave him my hand, he says "thank you" and then he puts it back on my lap. Then you move on and you do another drill, where you put your hands against his and he moves them and
2016-02-20 11:24:45	greduan	you follow them, simple, then he does where he moves a book and you gotta replicate those movements
2016-02-20 11:25:21	tm512	you think you've arrived at these conclusions on your own but the fact is that everyone you were around was influencing your beliefs
2016-02-20 11:25:24	greduan	in one of those, I just completely closed my eyes, but I could somehow see him grab the book and move it. and I did it, and at certain points I opened my eyes and yep his hand was where I thought it was.
2016-02-20 11:25:25	tm512	and they've stuck
2016-02-20 11:26:03	fyr	greduan, do you realise how crazy you sound right now?
2016-02-20 11:26:07	greduan	fyr: I do
2016-02-20 11:26:19	fyr	that doesn't reassure me
2016-02-20 11:26:32	tm512	takes someone truly crazy to realize how crazy they are, but still continue believing it anyway
2016-02-20 11:27:05	greduan	there's one thing "sounding crazy" and "being crazy". People that thought the world was a sphere and not flat "sounded crazy", but were they? :)
2016-02-20 11:27:16	greduan	anyway I'm just telling you guys my experience
2016-02-20 11:27:17	tm512	there really isn't a point to this argument. I used to argue an awful lot about religion, primarily with christians, and the shit you're spewing is almost exactly the same
2016-02-20 11:27:30	greduan	except Christians try to convert you. lol
2016-02-20 11:27:44	tm512	so I have no reason to believe that this argument is any more worthwhile than any of the arguments I've had in the past
2016-02-20 11:28:04	greduan	I don't give a shit if you believe me or not, I'm just stating my point of view, and it'll probably end as soon as you just say "OK" and make me understand that you understood me, whether you agree with me or not that's something different though.
2016-02-20 11:28:26	fyr	I'd rather keep this place 'faith free' thanks
2016-02-20 11:28:37	greduan	why did this even come up?
2016-02-20 11:28:43	fyr	that way no one gets upset
2016-02-20 11:28:46	greduan	oh right vypr and buddhism and shit got out of control on my end
2016-02-20 11:28:58	greduan	man I just realized my language has been very aggressive, sorry
2016-02-20 11:29:10	greduan	I'm calm as can be but I realize now you guys can only see my text
2016-02-20 11:29:12	greduan	not my face
2016-02-20 11:29:44	greduan	anyway
2016-02-20 11:30:01	greduan	I'm a Scientologist, you all don't need to believe me on anything, just stating my view. End of conversation.
2016-02-20 11:30:28	tm512	that's all arguments end up being
2016-02-20 11:30:34	tm512	just stating viewpoints
2016-02-20 11:30:36	greduan	arguments?
2016-02-20 11:30:38	tm512	and getting frustrated
2016-02-20 11:30:54	greduan	yeee
2016-02-20 11:30:58	fyr	greduan, WHAT
2016-02-20 11:31:03	greduan	fyr: ?
2016-02-20 11:31:12	fyr	you realise you are part of a cult right?
2016-02-20 11:31:19	greduan	oh you weren't here at the beginning
2016-02-20 11:31:27	greduan	scroll up where the subject came up
2016-02-20 11:31:35	fyr	I don't need to
2016-02-20 11:31:45	greduan	fuck it I'll state it again
2016-02-20 11:31:51	greduan	I am not part of the Church of Scientology
2016-02-20 11:31:59	tm512	really being part of any religious group is basically being a part of a cult
2016-02-20 11:32:05	greduan	Church of Scientology has virtually nothing to do with Scientology.
2016-02-20 11:32:08	greduan	tm512: +1
2016-02-20 11:32:09	fyr	it's still very culty
2016-02-20 11:32:19	tm512	cult and religious practice are almost synonyms
2016-02-20 11:32:24	greduan	yup
2016-02-20 11:32:51	tm512	it seems like greduan does not really practice religion, but rather just believes it, so I wouldn't say he's part of a cult
2016-02-20 11:32:58	greduan	lol
2016-02-20 11:33:16	tm512	unless I'm missing something
2016-02-20 11:33:48	greduan	nah you're right
2016-02-20 11:34:02	greduan	I just study it and practice some of it
2016-02-20 11:34:05	greduan	as in practice

2016-02-20 23:09:25	@z3bra	obviously
2016-02-20 23:11:21	@z3bra	just compiled it btw
2016-02-20 23:11:28	@z3bra	do you have "pango" installed?
2016-02-20 23:14:10	arc	yes
2016-02-20 23:16:19	@z3bra	then it should work

2016-02-21 04:03:51	stark	hup ?
2016-02-21 04:04:47	boobah	stark: do you know what rendering engine that html-to-pdf thing uses?
2016-02-21 04:06:20	stark	boobah, qtwebkit
2016-02-21 04:06:27	boobah	ah, thanks
2016-02-21 04:07:27	boobah	i was thinking of using it for a weather script. the script generates a html forecast view, sends it off to wkhtmltopdf and then prints the resulting pdf
2016-02-21 04:07:52	boobah	for my parent's house; they like having a print-out copy of the weather :P
2016-02-21 04:08:01	stark	lel 
2016-02-21 04:08:08	stark	I was about to ask why
2016-02-21 04:08:41	boobah	point being, i could use a qtwebkit browser for debugging and the output should look the same
2016-02-21 04:08:51	stark	i thought to myself  "wouldn't that be overkill for a status bar ..."
2016-02-21 04:09:06	boobah	haha, totally would
2016-02-21 04:10:30	stark	I have never printed under any *nix but there should be a command line utility that you can pipe the text to
2016-02-21 04:11:04	boobah	lp or lpr, part of CUPS
2016-02-21 04:11:22	boobah	iirc you can send pdfs directly. done it before.
2016-02-21 04:12:18	stark	but then again, in your case, your parents may prefer the fancy output ;D
2016-02-21 04:12:46	stark	Classic GUI vs TUI
2016-02-21 04:13:21	boobah	whaddya mean?
2016-02-21 04:13:46	boobah	this would all be automated for them, on a cron job. they would just collect the printed page from the printer each week.
2016-02-21 04:13:47	stark	"Where's the sun ?" "Come on Dad, can't you see this beautiful ASCII art of the sun ? ..."
2016-02-21 04:14:00	boobah	lol
2016-02-21 04:14:16	boobah	no, but that's the whole point of the HTML. i can make it look nice with images and fancy graphics and stuff.
2016-02-21 04:14:51	boobah	otherwise, sure, i could just print a .txt file. that's what i was thinking of doing before you pointed out the converter :)
2016-02-21 04:15:33	stark	Sure, whatever pleases :)

2016-02-21 04:51:50	fyr	hmm I wonder if there is a way to set a line of space between the status of tmux and the process
2016-02-21 04:55:31	boobah	fyr: `set force-height <single_window_height - 1>`
2016-02-21 04:55:36	boobah	but that's pretty hacky
2016-02-21 04:55:50	boobah	probably not what you want
2016-02-21 04:57:08	fyr	kinda...
2016-02-21 04:57:51	fyr	also <single_window_height - 1> bit isn't working
2016-02-21 04:58:16	boobah	you'd have to set it manually, it doesn't expand
2016-02-21 04:58:27	boobah	sucks, but it's the only thing coming up on google
2016-02-21 04:58:38	boobah	run tmux inside tmux :)
2016-02-21 04:58:50	fyr	!!
2016-02-21 04:59:18	boobah	\/
2016-02-21 04:59:31	boobah	yeah, that'd be awful
2016-02-21 05:01:17	arc	i run dtach inside tmux

2016-02-21 05:08:27	greduan	yo rocx I'm playing around with Emacs today
2016-02-21 05:10:06	arc	boobah: because it's useful
2016-02-21 05:10:28	arc	dtach detaches invididual applications, not sessions
2016-02-21 05:11:35	boobah	i see. i use dtach for my irc client. so you could still use tmux independently for multiplexing

2016-02-21 08:11:55	boobah	it was stated explicitl in the docs
2016-02-21 08:12:04	dcat	ah well
2016-02-21 08:12:16	dcat	command >output is POSIX
2016-02-21 08:12:53	boobah	to be fair, it wasn't advertising Bourne or POSIX complience. But I think we can all agree `> output command` takes a toll on legibility.
2016-02-21 08:13:23	dcat	which shell was it?
2016-02-21 08:13:29	boobah	"> out" or ">out" is personal preference. I prefer the former because I find it easier to read and, like I said, it works on the most platforms.
2016-02-21 08:13:37	boobah	hmmm...
2016-02-21 08:13:45	boobah	i don't remember tbh

2016-02-21 08:15:38	boobah	dcat: what's bs about it?
2016-02-21 08:16:04	@rocx	probably something about how bsd users are better at *nix things than GNU/Linux users.
2016-02-21 08:16:08	boobah	rocx: haha, didn't realize they renamed mirbsd
2016-02-21 08:16:19	@rocx	boobah: no clue, i've seen it used interchanged.
2016-02-21 08:16:23	dcat	I'm saying it sounds like bs

2016-02-21 08:17:40	boobah	Okay, well I'll say this

2016-02-21 08:18:14	%vypr	(in regards to the name of it)
2016-02-21 08:18:21	boobah	vypr: When did they change the name from MirBSD?
2016-02-21 08:18:28	boobah	dcat: It was an experimental shell, but the name is escaping me now. It had additional syntax features
2016-02-21 08:18:42	%vypr	they never did
2016-02-21 08:18:47	boobah	dcat: that allowed it to do special operations on stream redirection
2016-02-21 08:18:47	%vypr	they just used both
2016-02-21 08:19:03	%vypr	but the full official name is MirOS BSD

2016-02-21 08:19:26	dcat	I'm just pointing out that that story definitely sounds like bs
2016-02-21 08:19:48	@fro	what story
2016-02-21 08:19:53	@fro	i didn't read any of this shit
2016-02-21 08:19:58	dcat	rocx: what was the font that I liked so much
2016-02-21 08:20:16	boobah	dcat: so in order to make the parsing easy, they simply disallowed ">output", because the operators were to the tune of ">a output" for append, etc. You can see where they're coming from.
2016-02-21 08:20:41	boobah	fro: shell features that i'm currently talking about :P
2016-02-21 08:20:46	dcat	>">a output" for append
2016-02-21 08:21:02	@fro	so
2016-02-21 08:21:09	@fro	wouldn't this be documented somewhere?
2016-02-21 08:21:30	boobah	yeah, you can try googling if you like, but it was something kind of obscure.
2016-02-21 08:21:54	dcat	okay
2016-02-21 08:22:09	dcat	now I'm definitely going with the "gf in canada" thing
2016-02-21 08:22:37	boobah	I don't know what's so hard to believe about a one-man shell that uses ">a" for output appending
2016-02-21 08:22:43	@fro	unlike the gf in canada thing tho
2016-02-21 08:22:51	@fro	this would be mentioned somewhere

2016-02-21 08:32:02	@rocx	eh. the only advantage i could think of is the backlog idea. just scroll back a bit.

2016-02-21 08:43:24	@rocx	character, script, codepoints, instructions to input it, font, character code properties, and most importantly, the face property.
2016-02-21 08:44:22	@rocx	so if i ever need to figure out what a thing i need to change is called, run that on a region, and change its face.
2016-02-21 08:44:33	@rocx	eg. i do it over the "ERC>" text.
2016-02-21 08:45:10	@rocx	it's an erc-prompt, its face is "erc-prompt-face", it's a field, front-sticky, read-only, rear-nonsticky, and start-open... whatever those mean.

2016-02-22 09:50:14	@fro	did some guy break up with adam?
2016-02-22 09:50:20	@fro	or turn down his advances?
2016-02-22 09:50:22	fsociety	he can suck big vainy js dick
2016-02-22 09:50:37	josm	no, some idiot saying he's an idiot for not using js
2016-02-22 09:50:45	@fro	oh
2016-02-22 09:50:53	@fro	guess i'm an idiot too
2016-02-22 09:50:57	josm	I use node, but I don't got around saying "you idiot, use node"
2016-02-22 09:50:58	@fro	because i don't use js
2016-02-22 09:51:26	josm	according to that guy, yeah
2016-02-22 09:51:32	%vypr	josm: that's how _everything_ should be
2016-02-22 09:51:41	josm	vypr: indeed
2016-02-22 09:51:49	%vypr	i'm a buddhist, but i don't go around being cringey saying "CHRISTIANITY SUX"
2016-02-22 09:51:56	josm	exactly
2016-02-22 09:53:14	@fro	well it does suck
2016-02-22 09:53:30	%vypr	sure, but it's not my choice to choose what people believe
2016-02-22 09:53:44	%vypr	if they truly believe in it and they are happy with it, then who am i to judge
2016-02-22 09:53:48	greduan2	yall use ledger?
2016-02-22 09:53:54	@fro	if you're criticizing christianity itself then it shouldn't matter
2016-02-22 09:53:54	%vypr	greduan2: not since heath
2016-02-22 09:54:10	josm	vypr: savage
2016-02-22 09:54:17	greduan2	wut?
2016-02-22 09:54:26	%vypr	greduan2: you need to go outside more
2016-02-22 09:54:48	@fro	greduan doesn't wear deodorant
2016-02-22 09:54:55	@fro	he can't be trusted
2016-02-22 10:00:00		[09:54]
2016-02-22 10:05:56	@rocx	fro: criticizing christianity was how we have christianity as we know it today.
2016-02-22 10:11:00		[10:05]
2016-02-22 10:11:22	@fro	ok?
2016-02-22 10:12:02	@rocx	kay then.
2016-02-22 10:12:15	@rocx	holy crap i need to organize my ~/tmp.
2016-02-22 10:17:23	tm512	"criticizing christianity was how we have christianity as we know it today" << this doesn't make much sense
2016-02-22 10:17:39	%vypr	tm512: well
2016-02-22 10:17:45	%vypr	its accurate in a sense
2016-02-22 10:17:47	%vypr	not entirely, of course
2016-02-22 10:17:48	tm512	unless you're referring to how it's less popular than ever really
2016-02-22 10:18:02	@rocx	tm512: no. criticism is how we have the different branches.
2016-02-22 10:18:04	%vypr	criticism has shaped christianity throughout the years
2016-02-22 10:18:07	@rocx	like the 99 theses, for example.
2016-02-22 10:18:27	@rocx	granted that was more of criticism of the church, but that was still criticizing the very way of life.
2016-02-22 10:18:35	tm512	disagreement is how there are so many different branches of christianity
2016-02-22 10:18:55	@rocx	i'm also talking out of my rumpus so take these words with an atom of salt.
2016-02-22 10:19:23	@rocx	s/atom/molecule.
2016-02-22 10:21:07	fsociety	rocx: how was the party on saturday night
2016-02-22 10:21:13	@rocx	awesome.
2016-02-22 10:21:14	fsociety	was it sufficiently evil
2016-02-22 10:21:29	@rocx	yep. even the emperor's ghost showed up.
2016-02-22 10:22:39	fsociety	damn
2016-02-22 10:22:55	fsociety	i was so depressed i burnt the inside of my throat with pizza
2016-02-22 10:22:56	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 10:23:04	fsociety	actually that is what happened minus the depression
2016-02-22 10:23:45	%vypr	what did you do?
2016-02-22 10:23:54	%vypr	like eat the pizza immediately after it came out of the oven?
2016-02-22 10:24:16	fsociety	no, a bit of a pizza got stuck in my throat.. got lodged and it was burning the inside of my throat
2016-02-22 10:24:22	fsociety	quite painful
2016-02-22 10:24:24	%vypr	that's... not fun
2016-02-22 10:24:30	fsociety	yeah it isn't
2016-02-22 10:25:16	greduan2	just like how you have hot noodles/pasta and your slurping them and then they touch your chin and they're piping hot while for your mouth they're just hot
2016-02-22 10:25:17	greduan2	that sucks
2016-02-22 10:25:23	greduan2	not "just like"
2016-02-22 10:25:26	greduan2	but it's not fun either
2016-02-22 10:25:43	greduan2	rait guys?

2016-02-22 10:51:08	fyr	this argument on r/linux about ls output is hillarious
2016-02-22 10:51:33	@rocx	can programs tell when they're supposed to be piping?
2016-02-22 10:51:41	fyr	yes
2016-02-22 10:51:59	@rocx	if so, then having a pipable output when in a pipe is fine while having a more detailed/pretty output when solo.
2016-02-22 10:52:32	fyr	which is what this change is doing essentially

2016-02-22 11:21:23	@rocx	i don't see what the problem is.
2016-02-22 11:21:47	@rocx	certainly a lot more simpler to read in a listing 'testing one' than testing\ one
2016-02-22 11:22:13	@rocx	and it's not even there if you aren't a twit that puts spaces in your file names like a moron.
2016-02-22 11:22:42	@rocx	this is just people getting buttmad over a change.
2016-02-22 11:24:58	fyr	aye
2016-02-22 11:25:03	fyr	anyway
2016-02-22 11:25:03		[11:25]
2016-02-22 11:25:16	fyr	got lemonbar to print the command I want to execute to stdout
2016-02-22 11:25:27	%kirby	I thought one of the sacred rules was "don't parse ls"
2016-02-22 11:25:48	fyr	but how the hell do I get that string into /bin/sh
2016-02-22 11:25:50	fyr	grrrr
2016-02-22 11:25:55	%kirby	I don't like it because I don't see why it needs changing now when it's been fine for all these years
2016-02-22 11:26:09	%kirby	But there's never any need to parse ls

2016-02-22 11:29:26	@rocx	solution: don't use spaces in your file names.
2016-02-22 11:30:09	fsociety	which reminds me i'm going to write a notify-send python script using lemonbar.. thanks for reminding me
2016-02-22 11:30:12	fsociety	gonna do that tonight

2016-02-22 11:56:12	boobah	why
2016-02-22 11:56:35	fyr	I need a way to define var1, var2, var3 etc.. in a for loop
2016-02-22 11:56:44	fyr	on a single line
2016-02-22 11:56:54	fsociety	limitations of sh
2016-02-22 11:56:54		[11:56]
2016-02-22 11:56:56	boobah	you can see why bash has arrays and associative arrays :)
2016-02-22 11:57:07	boobah	just use a string with a delimiter
2016-02-22 11:57:29	boobah	and then just append with `var="${var} appended content"`
2016-02-22 11:57:31	fyr	let me send want I have currently

2016-02-22 11:59:12	boobah	fyr: yeah, you can't do that
2016-02-22 12:00:53	boobah	also watch out; your groupNum will only work if you have less than 10 groups, excluding 0
2016-02-22 12:00:54	fyr	boobah, that's the bit I need to work though :)

2016-02-22 12:01:45	boobah	fyr: i'd say use a space (' ') or whatever-delimited list and use `cut`
2016-02-22 12:02:09	fyr	yeah you're probably right
2016-02-22 12:02:41	fyr	hmm I'd rather use something other than a space though
2016-02-22 12:02:51	fyr	I hopefully want those preserved
2016-02-22 12:03:03	fyr	does cut work with tabs?
2016-02-22 12:03:06	boobah	yeah
2016-02-22 12:03:17	boobah	as long as it's a single character, it will work with cut.
2016-02-22 12:03:40	boobah	keep in mind it won't interpret '\t' for you, so set the delimiter literally
2016-02-22 12:03:57	boobah	i'll be back in a while; making dinner
2016-02-22 12:04:02	fyr	yeah cut -d\t -f ? right?

2016-02-22 13:27:47	skrzyp	just found notion wm, looks very good except a bit oldschool keybindings
2016-02-22 13:29:00	fyr	looked alittle inflexible for my liking
2016-02-22 13:30:22	skrzyp	I like the idea of manual tiling a lot
2016-02-22 13:36:00		[13:30]
2016-02-22 13:36:33	skrzyp	tfw I can barely read russian so I'm reading some russian bloga about notion wm which looks very popular there
2016-02-22 13:38:08	fsociety	i remember looking at notion
2016-02-22 13:38:16	fsociety	i'll never move from bspwm unfortunately
2016-02-22 13:41:59	fyr	!!!
2016-02-22 13:42:06	fyr	traitor to the wmutils
2016-02-22 13:42:25	josm	I should get around to using wmutils
2016-02-22 13:42:27	fsociety	you make it binary partition tile and i'll use it
2016-02-22 13:42:35	fyr	:(
2016-02-22 13:42:48	boobah	fyr: glad you're getting somewhere
2016-02-22 13:42:55	fyr	it's gotta just be done in C
2016-02-22 13:43:04	fsociety	does it really hav to be done in C
2016-02-22 13:43:09	fsociety	or can it be done in any language
2016-02-22 13:43:16	fyr	for it not to be horribly slow?
2016-02-22 13:43:16	boobah	if you're doing it in c, might as well just write a wm with libwm
2016-02-22 13:43:32	boobah	no point hacking together with wmutils unless it's gonna be scripts
2016-02-22 13:43:41	fyr	I still don't know the algoritm for it either
2016-02-22 13:44:00	boobah	isn't binary partitioning just being able to split tiles in half?
2016-02-22 13:44:05	fsociety	correct
2016-02-22 13:44:08	fyr	essentially
2016-02-22 13:44:33	boobah	i guess it's not so straightforward... ask baskerville :)
2016-02-22 13:44:42	fsociety	that is what i was gonna say
2016-02-22 13:44:45	fsociety	baskerville is the man to ask
2016-02-22 13:44:53	skrzyp	I like binary partitioning
2016-02-22 13:44:54	fyr	i'll probably end up at looking at the source code for bspwm anyway
2016-02-22 13:45:04	skrzyp	when it means splitting empty frames
2016-02-22 13:45:07	boobah	it's really a shame there are so few manual tilers/hybrid out there
2016-02-22 13:45:15	skrzyp	where I can drop my future windows
2016-02-22 13:45:25	boobah	like herbstluft
2016-02-22 13:45:31	skrzyp	and notion
2016-02-22 13:45:37	fyr	yeah if we got a script working well with wmutils it really would be the best of both worlds
2016-02-22 13:45:38	skrzyp	but herbstluftwm had some issues
2016-02-22 13:45:48	boobah	yeah i ended up ditching it too
2016-02-22 13:45:52	skrzyp	and I want to check out something else
2016-02-22 13:46:01	fsociety	i mean wmutils is still on my work machine, but when i get tons of windows happening, it starts to become a bit of nightmare
2016-02-22 13:46:21	boobah	what i also realized is that i never have more than 4 windows in a single desktop anyway
2016-02-22 13:46:33	fyr	yeah it really is designed for you to be managing it with groups effectively
2016-02-22 13:46:33	boobah	at a certain point, the windows are too small to be usable
2016-02-22 13:46:50	fsociety	fyr: oh i was using groups
2016-02-22 13:46:56	fsociety	still became a bit of a nightmare
2016-02-22 13:46:56	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 13:46:59	boobah	hehe, i should get into grouping/tagging
2016-02-22 13:47:13	boobah	still on the ancient virtual desktop paradigm
2016-02-22 13:47:17	fyr	fsociety, yeah because you have to remember where a window is ...
2016-02-22 13:47:29	fyr	and then position it effectively
2016-02-22 13:48:23	boobah	another thing, is that once you have more than a few windows on-screen, it becomes tiresome to ADDRESS the windows. Either hitting mod-tab or mod-j/k a bunch of times
2016-02-22 13:49:39	fyr	that too
2016-02-22 13:49:57	fyr	but I think that is very true of ANY keyboard driven wm
2016-02-22 13:50:11	fsociety	see using it my work machine is great because its a really old machine.
2016-02-22 13:50:32	fsociety	the only thing i use the mouse these days is just moving it to manually focus a window
2016-02-22 13:50:32	boobah	fyr: yeah, it is. just felt like saying it :)
2016-02-22 13:50:32	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 13:50:42	fyr	yeah, no resources to use wmutils at all...
2016-02-22 13:50:54	fyr	boobah, I see ^^
2016-02-22 13:51:13	boobah	fsociety: i only use mine for the webbrowser. hints don't work properly half the time.
2016-02-22 13:51:13		[13:51]
2016-02-22 13:51:53	fyr	boobah, what are you using?
2016-02-22 13:54:06	fyr	http://pub.iotek.org/p/EpuLJYU
2016-02-22 13:54:10	boobah	monsterwm-xcb :P
2016-02-22 13:55:02	fyr	well I was more refering to the plugin :D
2016-02-22 13:55:07	fsociety	what is that link
2016-02-22 13:55:14	fyr	a webm
2016-02-22 13:55:25	fsociety	ahh.. came up as a bin in firefox
2016-02-22 13:55:36	boobah	nice, glad it's working. also +1 for mosh.
2016-02-22 13:55:36	fyr	fuck firefox
2016-02-22 13:55:42	josm	man fyr why you gotta make me jealous
2016-02-22 13:55:49	boobah	fyr: oh, sorry. an ancient commit of jumanji.
2016-02-22 13:55:51	josm	nice setup
2016-02-22 13:55:52	fyr	josm, sorry :(
2016-02-22 13:56:11	fyr	bar is somewhat lacking to say the least right now
2016-02-22 13:57:04	fyr	want a way to assign windows to a group now
2016-02-22 13:57:14	fyr	but that is probably enough for tonight I sense
2016-02-22 13:57:27	fsociety	you are tiling again fyr 
2016-02-22 13:57:39	fyr	fsociety, nope, that's just how I 'snap' my windows
2016-02-22 13:57:43	fyr	sec
2016-02-22 13:58:04	boobah	fyr: what's your streaming music player? pms?
2016-02-22 13:58:13	fsociety	but thats a great little webm
2016-02-22 13:58:25	fyr	boobah, mps-youtube
2016-02-22 13:58:32	fyr	fsociety, http://pub.iotek.org/p/mLm9633
2016-02-22 13:58:34	fsociety	my lastest desktop screenie is /r/unixporn from the other day
2016-02-22 13:58:41	fsociety	is on /r/unixporn*
2016-02-22 13:58:55	fyr	it 'snaps' to the grid in the sense
2016-02-22 13:58:59	fsociety	but it aint wmutils
2016-02-22 13:59:05	fyr	yeah :(
2016-02-22 13:59:10	fsociety	fyr = wmutils 4 lyfe
2016-02-22 13:59:14	fyr	nice screenie though
2016-02-22 13:59:29	fsociety	i do like what you have done though
2016-02-22 13:59:34	fyr	i swear people only upvote you for the massive monitors :D
2016-02-22 13:59:36	fsociety	i need to get a copy of your tmux config
2016-02-22 13:59:42	fsociety	fyr: probably
2016-02-22 13:59:58	fsociety	i always wondered why people always upvote me so much
2016-02-22 14:00:00	fsociety	i just don't get it
2016-02-22 14:00:08	fsociety	even deviantart people do the same thing
2016-02-22 14:00:11	fyr	all terminals, nice colors clean bar
2016-02-22 14:00:53	fsociety	trust my little linux meet up in melbourne with a few people, im always the butt of a joke. you have 32gb of ram and you run that
2016-02-22 14:01:05	fsociety	trust me* 
2016-02-22 14:01:06	fyr	lol
2016-02-22 14:01:23	fsociety	i guess the other dimms of ram are feeling lonely
2016-02-22 14:01:34	boobah	fsociety: is that 2x u3415 or something? jesus
2016-02-22 14:01:43	fyr	I could run my config on 2gb's only
2016-02-22 14:01:55	fyr	even less probably
2016-02-22 14:02:27	boobah	back when i used wmutils i was on a machine with 512 MB
2016-02-22 14:02:29	fyr	I am only using 2 gigs even with chrome and 20+ tabs open
2016-02-22 14:02:54	fsociety	boobah: http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/monitor-printer/monitor/curved-monitor/LS34E790CNS/XY
2016-02-22 14:03:01	fsociety	thats what i use
2016-02-22 14:03:23	fsociety	so have that tiny font fyr uses from artwiz is impossible on this monitor
2016-02-22 14:03:26	fsociety	i wish i could use it
2016-02-22 14:03:36	fyr	yeah :/
2016-02-22 14:03:45	fyr	I'm scaried when I do get a new monitor
2016-02-22 14:03:58	fyr	my font *might* be unreadable
2016-02-22 14:04:11	fsociety	if its any higher than 1080p it becomes a bit too small
2016-02-22 14:04:18	fyr	I bet
2016-02-22 14:04:33	boobah	i fear this also. when the time comes for me to go high-dpi, i'll probably just remake all my fonts into larger, more detailed versions
2016-02-22 14:04:35	fyr	although it's more to do with pixel density than resoloution
2016-02-22 14:04:41	boobah	i mean, i use my own fonts already
2016-02-22 14:04:51	fsociety	boobah: can i see these fonts
2016-02-22 14:05:34	boobah	let me find a picture, hang on
2016-02-22 14:06:05	fyr	mhm I should get writing my windows.sh script
2016-02-22 14:06:15	fyr	it's been sitting there as a shell for far too long
2016-02-22 14:06:15		[14:06]
2016-02-22 14:06:25	fyr	and I need features wgroups doesn't really provide
2016-02-22 14:09:28	fsociety	you should include a panel as part of your wm suite :)
2016-02-22 14:09:32	boobah	fsociety: http://pub.iotek.org/p/v2HOYEC.png
2016-02-22 14:09:57	fyr	holy
2016-02-22 14:10:07	fyr	people complain about lemon being unreadable lol
2016-02-22 14:10:19	@rocx	they're both unreadable. let's solve that argument.
2016-02-22 14:10:24	boobah	it's quite readable, actually. it's just small.
2016-02-22 14:10:27	josm	lemon best font
2016-02-22 14:10:33	fsociety	i use a modified terminus font called terminus12
2016-02-22 14:10:39	josm	uushi is..more readable I suppose
2016-02-22 14:10:46	boobah	wanna see my 3x5 font?
2016-02-22 14:10:49	josm	I use envypn for my terminals
2016-02-22 14:10:51	fsociety	sure
2016-02-22 14:10:54	boobah	you guys will shit your pants
2016-02-22 14:11:07	fyr	uushi is too wide
2016-02-22 14:11:22	josm	true
2016-02-22 14:11:27	josm	I wanted to use creep
2016-02-22 14:11:51	@fro	hrm
2016-02-22 14:11:57	josm	envypn will do though
2016-02-22 14:11:58	boobah	I actually used this full-time for a week, but then my eyes hurt and I went back to the other one: http://pub.iotek.org/p/ScCBDaJ.png
2016-02-22 14:12:03	@fro	is creep the one with the weird f
2016-02-22 14:12:11	josm	wtf boobah
2016-02-22 14:12:16	josm	that IS unreadable
2016-02-22 14:12:19	fyr	omg
2016-02-22 14:12:20	@fro	how the fuck can you see that
2016-02-22 14:12:21	@fro	haha
2016-02-22 14:12:35	boobah	on a 100 PPI monitor it's not too bad
2016-02-22 14:12:37	fyr	talk about trying to maximise space
2016-02-22 14:12:51	@fro	jesus
2016-02-22 14:12:55	boobah	yeah it was ridiculous. i had so much terminal space.
2016-02-22 14:12:57	josm	fyr: https://github.com/romeovs/creep
2016-02-22 14:13:00	josm	that's creep
2016-02-22 14:13:11	@fro	yeah see
2016-02-22 14:13:18	@fro	creep is perfect except for that f
2016-02-22 14:13:22	@fro	that f irritates me
2016-02-22 14:13:28	boobah	change it
2016-02-22 14:13:33	@fro	pass
2016-02-22 14:13:38	josm	I kinda like it tbh
2016-02-22 14:13:43	%vypr	oob
2016-02-22 14:13:47	fyr	yeah creep is too small for me personally
2016-02-22 14:13:50	fsociety	i actually like the look of creep
2016-02-22 14:14:00	fsociety	though i dare say putting it on a 2k monitor would be hell
2016-02-22 14:14:26	fsociety	though this could be good for netbook
2016-02-22 14:14:49	boobah	i started with lemon, then modded it and called it "lumen", then just recreated it from scratch and called it "bitterm", which is the first link I posted above.
2016-02-22 14:14:57	@fro	my screen is only 12.5"
2016-02-22 14:15:10	@fro	and low res
2016-02-22 14:15:13	josm	my monitors are 22" so it's fine for me
2016-02-22 14:15:22	@fro	i could use a smaller font
2016-02-22 14:15:22	josm	but as I said, I use envypn in my terms
2016-02-22 14:15:26	@fro	but i dunno
2016-02-22 14:15:41	fsociety	any recommendations on a distro for a netbook - fyr: will say crux
2016-02-22 14:15:50	boobah	not crux for fuck's sake
2016-02-22 14:15:55	@fro	openbsd
2016-02-22 14:15:58	fyr	crux!
2016-02-22 14:16:00	josm	alpine? void?
2016-02-22 14:16:02	fsociety	hahahaha
2016-02-22 14:16:08	fyr	honestly though
2016-02-22 14:16:10	boobah	void, if you don't mind gnu.
2016-02-22 14:16:19	fyr	void, or openbsd
2016-02-22 14:16:29	fyr	debian if you want super stable
2016-02-22 14:16:33	fsociety	i think i might the go the bsd route for something different
2016-02-22 14:16:53	josm	good idea
2016-02-22 14:16:58	boobah	just make sure it's not source-based. compiling huge packages on an Intel Atom or whatever is going to be hell.
2016-02-22 14:17:09	josm	I still need to try any bsd for myself
2016-02-22 14:17:20	fsociety	yeah i know, i was considering gentoo then though it would take a month of compiling
2016-02-22 14:17:26	fsociety	bsd os recommendations?
2016-02-22 14:17:33	fyr	boobah, not if you make packages on a more powerful machine then export them :)
2016-02-22 14:18:18	boobah	fyr: yeah, i guess so. does crux have a native binary packaging system?
2016-02-22 14:19:28	fyr	well it makes a 'pkg.tar.gz' which you can then install using pkgadd
2016-02-22 14:19:45	fyr	as long as you used portable make flags ofc
2016-02-22 14:20:04	 < 	kirby (alex@7338E425.FAA08BA3.9A5EAAF5.IP) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2016-02-22 14:20:48	boobah	fyr: so it puts all the binaries in the tarball?
2016-02-22 14:21:04	boobah	all the binaries for that specific package, i mean obviously
2016-02-22 14:21:46	fyr	yeah
2016-02-22 14:21:46		[14:21]
2016-02-22 14:22:06	fyr	you just specify the DESTDIR in the pkgfile itself
2016-02-22 14:22:21	fyr	usually 'make DESTDIR=$PKG install'
2016-02-22 14:22:59	boobah	thats cool
2016-02-22 14:23:59	fsociety	*cough*
2016-02-22 14:24:02	fsociety	bsd recommendations
2016-02-22 14:24:11	fsociety	maybe i should go one of those extremely suckless linux distros
2016-02-22 14:24:12	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-22 14:25:33	boobah	does openbsd have problems with laptop battery life, or just performance in general?
2016-02-22 14:26:06	fyr	fsociety, if you come to crux we can be crux buddies!!
2016-02-22 14:26:16	fsociety	are you willing to help me install it
2016-02-22 14:26:20	fyr	sure
2016-02-22 14:26:30	fsociety	alright.. i'll download the iso then
2016-02-22 14:26:44	fyr	sweet
2016-02-22 14:26:48	fyr	grab the torrent
2016-02-22 14:26:57	fsociety	it will be my task for this evening when i get home from work.. but i'll download it remotely now

2016-02-22 14:29:20	fsociety	if i find it worthy i may put it on my i7
2016-02-22 14:29:31	fsociety	but im enjoying gentoo atm
2016-02-22 14:29:45	fyr	gentoo too complicated for a source distro
2016-02-22 14:29:58	fyr	you eventually just want to get on with your life
2016-02-22 14:30:16	fsociety	but isn't crux more difficult to install?
2016-02-22 14:30:35	boobah	gentoo has better documentation, i'd say
2016-02-22 14:30:37	fyr	I've never done the gentoo install so I can't compare directly
2016-02-22 14:30:55	thlst	i want to use crux, but i love pacman :c
2016-02-22 14:30:57	fyr	the bulk of crux install is compiling the kernel
2016-02-22 14:30:59	fsociety	yeah it does.. crux for me was like "so where is the doco? oh thats the doco.. oh god"
2016-02-22 14:31:05	boobah	thlst: put pacman on crux
2016-02-22 14:31:08	fyr	if you already have an image it's a cakewalk
2016-02-22 14:31:23	boobah	i did gentoo once just to say i did it. i wasn't particularly interested in portage or anything, so i never used it
2016-02-22 14:31:36	fyr	gentoo's docs are pretty good
2016-02-22 14:31:50	fyr	I wish the crux wiki was on a more modern wiki system..
2016-02-22 14:32:01	fyr	it's so ancient and unfriendly to edit
2016-02-22 14:32:04	boobah	gentoo has/had a larger userbase of course
2016-02-22 14:32:06	fsociety	i think if crux had a more modern wiki it would be utilised more
2016-02-22 14:32:32	fsociety	or you could go funtoo with a much smaller userbase, and its designed to make gentoo much simplier
2016-02-22 14:33:15	boobah	still though, portage is a giant python script
2016-02-22 14:33:26	fsociety	that it is
2016-02-22 14:34:05	boobah	not meaning to bash it though, funtoo's been on my "to try" list
2016-02-22 14:34:22	fsociety	i used it for a while
2016-02-22 14:34:31	fsociety	has a really small tight nit community to it
2016-02-22 14:35:02	fsociety	unfortunately i kept grabbing ebuilds from gentoo's git and putting them in mine, cause i was impatient getting certain releases
2016-02-22 14:35:09	fsociety	so i just ended up installing gentoo
2016-02-22 14:35:25	boobah	neat. i'm still kind of bummed we have to share a kernel with all the ubuntu/mint normies
2016-02-22 14:35:39	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-22 14:35:48	boobah	i feel like an asshole, but i keep wanting to move away from linux for this reason
2016-02-22 14:35:53	fsociety	those *buntu hipsters
2016-02-22 14:36:10	boobah	but then... linux does almost everything better so i stay
2016-02-22 14:36:58	fsociety	the main reason i moved to linux back in 2007 was i wanted to know what my computer was doing. i was getting tired of microsoft obfuscating everything
2016-02-22 14:36:58		[14:36]
2016-02-22 14:37:22	boobah	that is also why i moved
2016-02-22 14:37:24	fsociety	also i came from the niche computer era days where you had to type code listings to play video games. so linux appealed to me purely because of that
2016-02-22 14:37:27	fyr	that's exactly why I moved just over 3 months ago

2016-02-22 14:39:52	fsociety	a lot of the listing would have a lot of asm code you would inject into the basic code listings

2016-02-22 15:09:03	skrzyp	and after soldering, I can recommend you to fix it with epoxy glue
2016-02-22 15:09:11	boobah	hehe, yeah. i might have to get creative and solder wires into the battery compartment bed-of-nails pads :)
2016-02-22 15:09:17	@rocx	"Service ABS System" comes up a lot in it.
2016-02-22 15:09:25	boobah	rocx: lol
2016-02-22 15:09:29	skrzyp	but the problem with n900 is that its keyboard is not so good, and there's no space for altgr there
2016-02-22 15:09:31	@rocx	first time this happened, we got it checked and the ABS was good.
2016-02-22 15:09:36	fsociety	fyr: i never had any issues with pacman
2016-02-22 15:09:41	@rocx	second time, it was determined it was a light and it was said it was fixed.
2016-02-22 15:09:45	fyr	fsociety, lucky
2016-02-22 15:09:49	@rocx	now i don't trust "Service ABS System" lights.
2016-02-22 15:10:26	fsociety	i used arch for years, but bored because i wanted to know how linux actually worked which is why i installed gentoo
2016-02-22 15:10:31	boobah	rocx: i'm buying a car at the beginning of the summer, and i CAN'T WAIT.
2016-02-22 15:10:49	@rocx	get a car, not a van.
2016-02-22 15:10:54	boobah	of course :)
2016-02-22 15:11:00	@rocx	a van/truck are one of those things that you'll never need until you need one.
2016-02-22 15:11:09	fsociety	i need one cause i play drums
2016-02-22 15:11:10	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 15:11:25	fsociety	drums + van = mandatory
2016-02-22 15:11:26	@rocx	fsociety: coworker back at my old job managed to carry their drums around in a geo metro.
2016-02-22 15:11:28	boobah	i feel you. i think a hatchback or small wagon is best for me considering what i haul around.
2016-02-22 15:11:42	fsociety	i can fit my kit in a suzuki alto
2016-02-22 15:11:42	@rocx	they're apparently roomier than they appear.

2016-02-22 15:19:57	fsociety	here is a question, what browsers do you recommend
2016-02-22 15:20:13	fsociety	i tried qutebrowser and vimb, but webkit just likes to segfault occasionally
2016-02-22 15:20:15	boobah	absolutely none at all.
2016-02-22 15:20:24	fsociety	boobah: do you telnet? ;)
2016-02-22 15:20:27	fsociety	are you doing an rms
2016-02-22 15:20:41	boobah	hehe, no i don't read my email with wget
2016-02-22 15:21:04	boobah	but seriously every browser in current existence is terrible in one way or another
2016-02-22 15:21:11	fsociety	yeah i know
2016-02-22 15:21:17	fsociety	it's painful
2016-02-22 15:21:58	boobah	i wish i was skilled enough to write a web rendering engine
2016-02-22 15:22:10	boobah	then i could end the suffering, for nixers at least
2016-02-22 15:22:27	fsociety	i tried palemoon, but vimperator and pendactyl don't work properly in it
2016-02-22 15:22:27		[15:22]
2016-02-22 15:23:28	boobah	there are webkit browsers with decent interfaces, but webkit itself sucks ass
2016-02-22 15:23:37	fsociety	yeah i know
2016-02-22 15:23:46	fsociety	its slow, painful and takes 3 years to compile
2016-02-22 15:23:54	boobah	yep!
2016-02-22 15:24:31	boobah	too bad the web evolved. making a gopher client is easy.
2016-02-22 15:24:39	@rocx	yeah. i still need to make my own.
2016-02-22 15:24:54	boobah	rocx: your own gopher client?
2016-02-22 15:24:56	@rocx	yeah.
2016-02-22 15:25:15	boobah	you could, but there are some decent ones out there
2016-02-22 15:25:21	@rocx	i already got the downloading tidbit down pat. now comes the issue to make it interactive.

2016-02-22 15:25:41	@rocx	yeah. it's a project as i learn how to make an interactive major mode.
2016-02-22 15:25:45	@rocx	Elisp.
2016-02-22 15:25:56	boobah	oh, wow. good for you man!
2016-02-22 15:26:38	@rocx	but for now, i'm working on Çefrai.
2016-02-22 15:27:29	boobah	that came up for me as '?efrai'. what?
2016-02-22 15:27:49	@rocx	that means you should be using a proper font.
2016-02-22 15:28:01	tm512	or proper encoding
2016-02-22 15:28:10	@rocx	either way...
2016-02-22 15:28:11	@rocx	it was a C with a cedilla.
2016-02-22 15:28:12	boobah	it's not the font. it's something to do with my ssh connection and locale
2016-02-22 15:28:24	boobah	or character encoding
2016-02-22 15:28:58	boobah	rocx: what is that?
2016-02-22 15:29:01	@rocx	just making my own language for an artistic purpose.
2016-02-22 15:29:31	boobah	cool. i drafted a replacement C-language syntax a few months ago
2016-02-22 15:29:40	boobah	just to be artsy i guess

2016-02-22 15:31:13	@rocx	yeah. got several in the works for that comic.
2016-02-22 15:31:36	@rocx	this one i think is heading in the direction of the Portuguese language after finding out about it.
2016-02-22 15:31:36	boobah	neat. you taking linguistics or anything?
2016-02-22 15:31:42	@rocx	no. self-teaching this.

2016-02-22 15:31:57	@rocx	then there's the japanese-like Yakuwa.
2016-02-22 15:32:31	fsociety	i just tried this creep font
2016-02-22 15:32:34	fsociety	so hard to read
2016-02-22 15:32:56	boobah	fsociety: i can imagine it's pretty small on your displays
2016-02-22 15:33:05	fsociety	im trying it on my work machine
2016-02-22 15:33:09	fsociety	which is a 21" 1080p monitor
2016-02-22 15:33:21	@rocx	but besides that, there was "Komon", aka English, for the old RP sessions that we did but throw whatever alternative alphabets we could.
2016-02-22 15:33:21	@rocx	Hellenistic used Deseret, F'z used Elian, Elven used Tengwar, etc.
2016-02-22 15:33:56	boobah	fsociety: i know "fsociety" is a mr. robot reference, but i haven't watched the show. does it mean "fuck society" or what?
2016-02-22 15:34:10	fsociety	it can mean two things
2016-02-22 15:34:14	fsociety	fuck society or free society
2016-02-22 15:34:28	boobah	oh cool
2016-02-22 15:34:28	@rocx	or it could just be "fsociety", like "fnord".

2016-02-22 15:44:45	fsociety	i read a book about the multimedia department of microsoft in the mid 90s.  so many contract programmers deliberately put bugs in their code because they hated how they were treated
2016-02-22 15:44:47	@rocx	if i worked at MS, i'd be trying to get high to pass the day away.
2016-02-22 15:44:54	boobah	rocx: hah, me too
2016-02-22 15:45:19	boobah	fsociety: woowww. yeah i'm really glad i ditched using microsoft products years ago.

2016-02-22 15:46:34	fsociety	i remember in this book, i have to find it again.  so many programmers but crippling bugs in microsoft encarta that they delayed the release
2016-02-22 15:46:34	fsociety	haha
2016-02-22 15:46:51	fsociety	naaa.. one programmer put in easter eggs about how shit microsoft was

2016-02-22 16:04:21	Lola	I intended to write a simple cronjob that backs up my homedir every night, I'm now halfway through recompiling acpi and I have no idea why
2016-02-22 16:04:57	Lola	I mean books count as documentation don't they? So most programmers would be terrible at them
2016-02-22 16:07:43	fsociety	haha.. the moment when your boss goes "can you document that please?" and they run screaming
2016-02-22 16:10:31	Lola	it's not as bad as when you need to use someone else's code that isn't documented

2016-02-23 04:10:12	fyr	well want it to be done automatically
2016-02-23 04:10:18	fyr	using set-titles-string so far
2016-02-23 04:10:21	fyr	that works fine

2016-02-23 04:28:25	fsociety	morning
2016-02-23 04:28:35	fsociety	seems qutebrowser has become a lot more stabler recently
2016-02-23 04:28:36	fsociety	excellent
2016-02-23 04:29:31	fsociety	oo. and supports wayland thats interesting
2016-02-23 04:30:45	greduan2	based on webkit right?
2016-02-23 04:30:55	fsociety	unfortunately, but its the most stable of the lot that use it
2016-02-23 04:30:57	@rocx	what isn't these days?
2016-02-23 04:31:05	greduan2	that's why I didn't use it, cause I tried it out on a source-based distro.
2016-02-23 04:31:10	greduan2	and webkit takes *ages* to compile
2016-02-23 04:31:15	fyr	this
2016-02-23 04:31:17	greduan2	I gave it 5 hours, didn't finish compiling
2016-02-23 04:31:24	greduan2	Firefox compiles in 1, tops
2016-02-23 04:31:28	fyr	you thought compiling firefox was bad!
2016-02-23 04:31:28	greduan2	for me
2016-02-23 04:31:36	greduan2	with my super old computer from 2007
2016-02-23 04:32:10	greduan2	witha  modern computer Firefox would probs take me 30 mins to compile
2016-02-23 04:32:18	greduan2	webkit would probably still take me more than 5 hours
2016-02-23 04:32:27	greduan2	I feel bad for those people that have to compile that shit daily lol
2016-02-23 04:32:43	@rocx	they probably distribute-compile it.
2016-02-23 04:33:52	@rocx	holy crap i hate this government class.
2016-02-23 04:34:06	greduan2	is that a citizen class or a school class
2016-02-23 04:34:07	greduan2	?
2016-02-23 04:34:10	@rocx	school class.
2016-02-23 04:34:28	@rocx	we never cover anything in class because "it encourages us to read".
2016-02-23 04:34:33	greduan2	government class : pompous know-nothings bout internet
2016-02-23 04:34:40	@rocx	heck, random questions of GA gov. on these quizzes.

2016-02-23 04:37:05	greduan2	listening to Panic! At The Disco, can't see what all the rage is all about, except for one cool song. lol
2016-02-23 04:38:23	fyr	dcat, z3bra: how are window id's generated, or where do you get them from?
2016-02-23 04:38:26	fsociety	i've been stuck listening to the band Textures for the past few weeks
2016-02-23 04:38:35	fsociety	new album was released, and well its on heavy rotation
2016-02-23 04:38:37	@xero	fyr: for tmux title try: printf '\033k┐(T_T)┌\033\'
2016-02-23 04:40:04	fyr	xero, I've got a somewhat cleaner solution
2016-02-23 04:40:12	greduan2	http://cute-jumper.github.io/emacs/2016/02/22/my-simple-setup-to-avoid-rsi-in-emacs
2016-02-23 04:40:30	fyr	just do set-titles-string "tmux: #T"
2016-02-23 04:40:40	fyr	#T refering to the window title
2016-02-23 04:40:53	fyr	so individual programs can still set the title and send their data that way
2016-02-23 04:40:58	@rocx	greduan2: C-g kind of became embedded in memory.
2016-02-23 04:42:41	greduan2	Yeah IKR
2016-02-23 04:42:41		[04:42]
2016-02-23 04:42:51	greduan2	I sometimes use than in Vim after a couple days of Emacs
2016-02-23 04:43:01	greduan2	in Emacs I tend to use ESC after months of using Vim. lol
2016-02-23 04:43:22	@rocx	ESC-ESC-ESC gets you out of other things too if you're bent on escape.
2016-02-23 04:43:31	greduan2	esc esc esc, oh wait this is Emacs, C-g (esc C-g is no a valid bind), C-g boom
2016-02-23 04:43:47	@rocx	C-g C-g
2016-02-23 04:43:57	@rocx	simple as tapping `g' twice.
2016-02-23 04:44:26	@rocx	oh okay then they talk about hydra.
2016-02-23 04:44:36	@rocx	still not 100% sure what hydra is.
2016-02-23 04:44:42	@xero	HAIL HYDRA!
2016-02-23 04:45:54	greduan2	Hydra is like a prefix bind afaict
2016-02-23 04:46:09	greduan2	I.e. C-z and you can set that up so it's a hydra bind
2016-02-23 04:46:27	@rocx	huh. so kind of like all these leader things for vim/evil?
2016-02-23 04:46:30	greduan2	which means you press C-z a a a a a and that's like pressing C-z C-a C-z C-a etc. etc., for example
2016-02-23 04:46:42	@rocx	oh.
2016-02-23 04:46:45	greduan2	which means you can setup movement binds very effectively with that
2016-02-23 04:46:55	greduan2	afaict iirc
2016-02-23 04:47:05	greduan2	I never implemented it in my own setup properly
2016-02-23 04:47:25	greduan2	but I want to implement a minimal vim mode (for movement) with hydra
2016-02-23 04:48:06	sbrg	yeah, that's pretty accurate. 
2016-02-23 04:48:28	sbrg	you go into a 'mode' after running a hydra so that you can hit the keys repeatedly until you hit a key that is not part of the 'hydra', then it exits
2016-02-23 04:48:33	sbrg	I use it for resizing windows and stuff. 
2016-02-23 04:49:23	greduan2	yeah so it's to enter specific flows
2016-02-23 04:49:32	greduan2	manipulation very repetetive stuff for example
2016-02-23 04:49:57	greduan2	repetitive or repetetive?
2016-02-23 04:50:03	greduan2	both look wrong
2016-02-23 04:51:33	sbrg	repetitive. 
2016-02-23 04:51:46	greduan2	oooooooh, dick move Panic! At The Disco. You used a Chicago opening in your song

2016-02-23 05:34:09	fsociety	haha
2016-02-23 05:34:13	dcat	:<
2016-02-23 05:34:22	dcat	it's only worthy of shit hardware
2016-02-23 05:34:26	dcat	evn moar cri
2016-02-23 05:34:47	fsociety	so i guess i use bspwm/wmutils
2016-02-23 05:34:50	fsociety	depending on the box :)
2016-02-23 05:34:54	dcat	lel
2016-02-23 05:34:57	dcat	which OS?
2016-02-23 05:35:02	dcat	and kernel
2016-02-23 05:35:11	fsociety	arch on work pc, gentoo on this one.. both are running 4.4.2
2016-02-23 05:35:50	dcat	ah cool
2016-02-23 05:36:14	fsociety	wmutils doesn't lend itself to large monitors
2016-02-23 05:36:15	fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-23 05:36:30	dcat	how so?
2016-02-23 05:36:56	fsociety	for me personally had issues with fullscreening occasionally
2016-02-23 05:37:14	fsociety	mostly firefox
2016-02-23 05:37:21	fsociety	but thats probably a scripting thing
2016-02-23 05:38:25	dcat	hrm
2016-02-23 05:40:20	greduan2	I'd love multiple monitor support from wmutils :>
2016-02-23 05:40:29	greduan2	iirc it didn't have it,r ight?
2016-02-23 05:41:13	fsociety	dylan112 figured it out if you like at his gits, might have to back a month or so in commits to find it
2016-02-23 05:41:36	dcat	I don't really see how it doesn't work with multiple monitors
2016-02-23 05:41:43	fsociety	https://github.com/dylanaraps/dotfiles
2016-02-23 05:45:36	dcat	fsociety: what would you want to change?
2016-02-23 05:45:42	@xero	i kinda like how laserwald is doing things: https://github.com/laserswald/backflip
2016-02-23 05:46:17	@xero	see: geo_disp.sh, current_disp.sh, and geo_disp.sh
2016-02-23 05:46:57	@xero	his fullscreen script only maximized the currently focused screen: https://github.com/laserswald/backflip/blob/master/fullscreen_disp.sh
2016-02-23 05:46:57		[05:46]
2016-02-23 05:47:00	fsociety	does anyone know how to solve this hinting issue with github
2016-02-23 05:47:01	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/SQdLD.png
2016-02-23 05:47:17	josm	maybe it's qutebrowser?
2016-02-23 05:47:25	josm	I don't get that with chromium
2016-02-23 05:47:28	fsociety	its every webkit browser
2016-02-23 05:47:33	josm	huh
2016-02-23 05:47:40	dcat	fsociety: where are you and dylan from?
2016-02-23 05:47:50	fsociety	firefox is fine, but if i use vimb, qutebrowser or any other non major browser it happens
2016-02-23 05:47:57	josm	fsociety: yeah I definitely don't get that
2016-02-23 05:48:09	greduan2	hinting, you mean the fonts? I haven't had that even in Webkit browsers
2016-02-23 05:48:15	greduan2	I had some fontconfig thingy iirc
2016-02-23 05:48:35	fsociety	yeah im wondering if its due to some font misconfiguration, but its default infinality under gentoo
2016-02-23 05:48:52	greduan2	https://gitlab.com/Greduan/dotfiles/raw/master/linux/fonts.conf
2016-02-23 05:49:04	greduan2	that goes in ~/.fonts.conf iirc
2016-02-23 05:49:12	greduan2	of course get rid of the default font definition
2016-02-23 05:50:02	greduan2	I used that to enable the smoothing without installing any special packages or anything like that on Arch and CRUX
2016-02-23 05:51:33	fsociety	brb just restarting X to see if this works

2016-02-23 11:06:43	+fyr	the -r option is the 'target' framerate you want to encode in
2016-02-23 11:06:52	+fyr	you never specify the source framerate
2016-02-23 11:07:15	+fyr	doing -framerate 60 then -r 30 seems to be giving me better results

2016-02-23 12:42:02	+fyr	you can use cat << EOF \n 'stuff to write to stdout' \nEOF
2016-02-23 12:42:05	@rocx	but people try "programming" in a shell.
2016-02-23 12:42:07	paul	insightful, no?
2016-02-23 12:42:16	paul	rocx: it's kinda want glues things together
2016-02-23 12:42:18	+fyr	instead of using echo mulitple times in a row
2016-02-23 12:42:19	paul	what*
2016-02-23 12:42:32	@rocx	paul: it's a glue. not a programming language to try the biggest trick shots with.
2016-02-23 12:43:08	paul	I mean, hell, I'll write up that script in C and port it to allll the *nix's and what not

2016-02-23 12:45:36	@rocx	a scripting environment can either be a DSL (domain-specific language) or a batch job execution tool (like a shell batch syntax).
2016-02-23 12:46:29	paul	right. Kinda didn't pay attention to the latter, they're all the same as long as it's turing complete IMO

2016-02-23 12:46:58	@rocx	in a sense, i'd classify a shell's batch syntax as a DSL of its own rather than general purpose.
2016-02-23 12:47:18	@rocx	its domain being in automation and execution of jobs.
2016-02-23 12:47:45	paul	mmm.

2016-02-23 21:57:06	mort_	were I to implement a linked list outside of uni, I wouldn't have made it only work with things extending Comparable, and wouldn't have a method to remove the smallest, as that should kind of be done outside of the list class
2016-02-23 21:57:47	mort_	also, for some reason, that Iterator just return an object, not something of type E

2016-02-23 22:15:52	mort_	though a linked list limited to things extending comparable is a bit more debatable

2016-02-23 23:23:08	sbrg	mort_: well, if you want to find things in your list you need to be able to compare them. sounds pretty logical to me.
2016-02-23 23:24:19	mort_	ye, but couldn't you have something outside of the list do the comparing?
2016-02-23 23:27:03	sbrg	I guess. I think there's a "comparator" class and a pattern that you use by implementing that for your type and then pass that
2016-02-23 23:27:08	sbrg	i think we did something like that anyway
2016-02-23 23:27:17	sbrg	but OOP is not my forté and definitely not in java so..

2016-02-23 23:55:24	mort_	well, Comparable is a class which many classes inherit from, letting you compare things regardless of their type
2016-02-23 23:55:26	mort_	isn't that hard
2016-02-23 23:55:36	@rocx	it just seems complex.
2016-02-23 23:55:45	mort_	not sure why it's not an interface
2016-02-23 23:56:14	@rocx	is an interface just a list of functions basically that each class can overload?
2016-02-23 23:56:19	@rocx	more or less?
2016-02-23 23:56:42	mort_	basically, ya
2016-02-23 23:57:00	mort_	and you can extend multiple interfaces, while you can only subclass one class
2016-02-23 23:57:05	@rocx	making sure i remember some things from the other java classes i had to take.
2016-02-23 23:59:52	mort_	what're you writing these days?

2016-02-24 08:41:04	+fyr	if I record it at the same time I have to split the video track and audio track tho :/
2016-02-24 08:41:57	+fyr	lossless file is good apart from the frameskips though
2016-02-24 08:42:09	+fyr	dunno if the audio is causing that or what

2016-02-24 08:48:48	+fyr	ah okay ffmpeg recommends just using the -framerate flag and not -r flag
2016-02-24 08:48:59	+fyr	that might be why it dropped frames
2016-02-24 08:50:25	fsociety	i tried encoding x265 4k on my i7 4770k the other day

2016-02-24 08:50:46	fsociety	yeah wasn't pretty
2016-02-24 08:51:30	+fyr	well the trick is to just record the lossless file then do the bulk of encoding later
2016-02-24 08:51:42	fsociety	i used to be in the scene doing tv encoding so its not like i'm some encoding noob either

2016-02-24 08:53:42	fsociety	first rule of scene, dont open source your tools. hahahaha

2016-02-24 08:53:56	@xero	smoothing filters and such

2016-02-24 09:08:13	fsociety	yeah i did scene stuff for a while, took too much of my time racing against other groups
2016-02-24 09:08:15	@xero	glad someonge got it
2016-02-24 09:08:17	fsociety	eventually i just left
2016-02-24 09:08:30	fsociety	the group is still going but a lot less activity
2016-02-24 09:08:32	@xero	gotta get that "scene cred"
2016-02-24 09:08:39	fsociety	their tags were -BWB and -RTA
2016-02-24 09:08:56	fsociety	its all epenis, and its full of very volatile people
2016-02-24 09:09:08	fsociety	98% windows users as well, which i found surprising
2016-02-24 09:15:00		[09:09]
2016-02-24 09:17:43	+fyr	huh okay recording audio and video at the same time caused the audio to skip
2016-02-24 09:17:58	+fyr	and it drops all the frames
2016-02-24 09:18:04	+fyr	in the time it skips
2016-02-24 09:18:14	+fyr	(i think..)
2016-02-24 09:19:36	fsociety	what are you trying to do fyr 
2016-02-24 09:19:52	+fyr	I've been writing some scripts for screencasting
2016-02-24 09:21:17	fsociety	using ffmpeg i'd imagine
2016-02-24 09:21:37	fsociety	i wonder if it makes any difference if you are using plain alsa backend or pulse
2016-02-24 09:23:51	+fyr	well pulse just uses alsa as it's backend sooooooo
2016-02-24 09:24:12	greduan	fuck yeah my refactor reduced the loading time by 80%
2016-02-24 09:24:19	greduan	i.e. it takes 80% of the time less, now
2016-02-24 09:24:29	fsociety	fyr: maybe so, but the way it interprets the audio is vastly different
2016-02-24 09:24:53	fsociety	tbh to get really good audio, you'd want to be using a low-latency configured kernel
2016-02-24 09:25:06	fsociety	less latency = less drop outs
2016-02-24 09:26:10	@xero	is that the rt-kernel?
2016-02-24 09:26:22	+fyr	fsociety, perhaps you're right but it only happens when I'm recording video at the same time.. :?
2016-02-24 09:26:27	@xero	i think that's what avlinux and kxstudio use iirc
2016-02-24 09:26:40	fsociety	xero: correct
2016-02-24 09:27:15	fsociety	fyr: the only thing i could suggest, is making when you are encoding its not hitting full 100% load.  i've had sound issues when it gest that far up
2016-02-24 09:27:30	fsociety	maybe try and adjust how much load the process can take and see if that helps
2016-02-24 09:27:40	fsociety	had multiple issues with kodi, audio and CPU load
2016-02-24 09:27:53	+fyr	well I am already using the ultrafast preset
2016-02-24 09:27:57	+fyr	:/
2016-02-24 09:28:05	fsociety	even so, change the affinity on the process
2016-02-24 09:28:09	@xero	kodi always runs like butter for me. even streaming 1080p over wifi
2016-02-24 09:28:16	fsociety	give it something like 75% of overall usage and see how it goes
2016-02-24 09:28:24	+fyr	using nice?
2016-02-24 09:28:28	fsociety	correct
2016-02-24 09:28:43	+fyr	higher number is less load right?
2016-02-24 09:29:14	fsociety	correct
2016-02-24 09:30:30	@xero	 interesting. i have never really read about rt was about until now.
2016-02-24 09:30:30		[09:30]
2016-02-24 09:30:42	@xero	it replaces most kernel spinlocks with mutexes that support priority inheritance
2016-02-24 09:30:49	@rocx	multimedia's a really screwy field.
2016-02-24 09:30:58	@rocx	a complex, patent-encumbered field.
2016-02-24 09:30:58	fsociety	i do a lot of audio prodution stuff in my spare time, latency is a bitch but improved dramatically in linux
2016-02-24 09:31:11	fsociety	actually thats one huge benefit of pulse, it makes jack easy to use also. but thats about it
2016-02-24 09:31:21	fsociety	too much lennart on my system is a bad thing ;)
2016-02-24 09:31:38	@rocx	iisn't any lennart too much lennart?
2016-02-24 09:32:18	fsociety	exactly
2016-02-24 09:32:43	fsociety	rocx: regarding patents, yeah especially when it comes to video compression patents
2016-02-24 09:32:56	fsociety	even vp8/vp9 and ogg are grey in some areas
2016-02-24 09:32:57	@rocx	can't wait for daala.
2016-02-24 09:33:11	fsociety	what's daala, new video codec?

2016-02-24 09:37:09	+fyr	hmm seems be alittle better when I run it with nice -n 19
2016-02-24 09:37:11	@rocx	xiph.
2016-02-24 09:37:12	@rocx	whatever.
2016-02-24 09:37:20	@rocx	it's not done yet though.
2016-02-24 09:37:30	fsociety	fyr: still having issues though
2016-02-24 09:37:31	+fyr	but the game itself is quite cpu heavy and it's still skipping slightly
2016-02-24 09:37:36	fsociety	ill check it out rocx 
2016-02-24 09:38:53	fsociety	have you tried using simple screen caster
2016-02-24 09:39:09	+fyr	no
2016-02-24 09:39:11	fsociety	thats the only screencasting software i've used on linux that does a really good job, even links into opengl calls
2016-02-24 09:39:18	+fyr	hmm
2016-02-24 09:39:21	+fyr	but ffmpeg
2016-02-24 09:39:24	+fyr	lossless
2016-02-24 09:39:37	fsociety	it uses ffmpeg, maybe you could rape the source code.. haha
2016-02-24 09:39:38	@xero	fyr wants to do things himself
2016-02-24 09:39:49	fsociety	not sure what it is written in though

2016-02-24 09:42:53	+fyr	okay again alittle bit improved
2016-02-24 09:42:59	fsociety	rocx: nice, they are putting patents on it to stop corps from infringing it, and will license it out freely 
2016-02-24 09:43:06	+fyr	it's weird though it's the audio that cuts out
2016-02-24 09:43:07	josm	evenin'
2016-02-24 09:43:14	@xero	o/ josm 
2016-02-24 09:43:15	+fyr	then ffmpeg drops frames
2016-02-24 09:43:17	fsociety	fyr: usually due to a buffer overrun
2016-02-24 09:43:29	+fyr	yeah I read that somewhere
2016-02-24 09:43:34	@xero	is you ram/cpu pegging?
2016-02-24 09:44:08	+fyr	I guess the cpu is
2016-02-24 09:44:21	+fyr	the game itself is running in wine which is probably what the problem is
2016-02-24 09:44:29	+fyr	it eats up a bunch of cpu too
2016-02-24 09:44:40	@fro	heh
2016-02-24 09:45:01	fsociety	ahh.. the game is probably pushing one core terribly
2016-02-24 09:45:15	fsociety	thats probably why you are getting the weird audio glitches
2016-02-24 09:45:24	fsociety	i don't think wine does multi-threading very well
2016-02-24 09:45:40	fsociety	you could try using wine-staging and see how that goes
2016-02-24 09:45:40		[09:45]
2016-02-24 09:45:45	+fyr	yeah I think the game is single core even on windows
2016-02-24 09:45:50	@rocx	wait, what voojoo jaem?
2016-02-24 09:46:09	fsociety	if thats the case, use nice on wine

2016-02-24 09:46:28	+fyr	hasn't made a difference sadly
2016-02-24 09:46:37	fsociety	do you have more than one soundcard in your pc at all
2016-02-24 09:46:55	fsociety	does your graphics card have an audiochip on it, most recent nvidia cards do
2016-02-24 09:46:58	@rocx	fsociety: the better question is how many of us use a soundcard as opposed to whatever integrated solution
2016-02-24 09:47:01	fsociety	you could route the audio from that
2016-02-24 09:47:12	@rocx	*whatever integrated chip deals with it.
2016-02-24 09:47:42	fsociety	i usually end up using the audio chip on one of my nvidia cards rather than the integrated audio. seperates the chain a little better
2016-02-24 09:48:01	+fyr	fsociety, yes but it's actually audio from my microphone.
2016-02-24 09:48:20	fsociety	so you are speaking over the top
2016-02-24 09:48:27	+fyr	indeeeeeeed
2016-02-24 09:48:50	+fyr	I haven't got loopback audio quite working yet :'(
2016-02-24 09:50:08	fsociety	is it a microphone that acts like its own soundcard?
2016-02-24 09:51:03	+fyr	nah just goes into the input mic
2016-02-24 09:52:31	fsociety	ahh.. i guess thats the other option by a cheapy headset mic or something that has a usb sound chip in it - only if you can't get past the issue
2016-02-24 09:53:45	+fyr	hmm

2016-02-24 10:36:12	mort_	is kind of sad, butu it seems to be the most sane way - I kind of want it to work for people on OS X or slightly old linux distros
2016-02-24 10:39:50	greduan	Python3
2016-02-24 10:40:14	greduan	Using Python2.7 is like using the first version of JS to make sure it works on old browsers
2016-02-24 10:40:46	mort_	nope
2016-02-24 10:41:21	mort_	using python 2.7 is like using the first version of JS because lots of peolpe actually use browsers which only support that, and a lot of systems come preinstalled with only browsers which are that old
2016-02-24 10:41:26	mort_	which would be pretty sane
2016-02-24 10:41:40	greduan	tell me, what version of Linux doesn't support Python3?
2016-02-24 10:41:43	@fro	lots of things still use python 2.7
2016-02-24 10:41:52	greduan	What version of OS X doesn't support Python3?
2016-02-24 10:41:56	greduan	fro: not saying that not
2016-02-24 10:42:08	greduan	but Python2 is frozen at 2.7 for eternity.
2016-02-24 10:42:14	mort_	debian jessie still comes with only python 2, OS X El Capitan still comes with only python 2
2016-02-24 10:42:22	greduan	mort_: can you install Python3?

2016-02-24 10:42:27	greduan	then you're not limited to Python2
2016-02-24 10:42:28	@fro	just saying
2016-02-24 10:42:56	mort_	using a language which comes with the user's computer will always be better than using one for which the user has to install an interpreter though
2016-02-24 10:43:46	greduan	nah
2016-02-24 10:43:54	mort_	is why you probably write ES5, or at least compile to ES5, instead of asking people to update to the very newest versions of chrome/FF and go to the browser's settings and enable experimental JS features
2016-02-24 10:44:04	greduan	oh I still use ES5
2016-02-24 10:44:08	greduan	cause I don't like ES6 lol
2016-02-24 10:44:14	greduan	it fucked up a lot of things iMO

2016-02-24 10:44:46	mort_	could definitely be another interesting discussion, but unrelated to this one
2016-02-24 10:44:53	greduan	which I understand is the reason that Python2 is still the standard, tons of devs dev in it cause they didn't like the changes Python3, but they've been like thie for fucking  years
2016-02-24 10:46:08	mort_	I don't like python 3 because writing code which supports python 2 and 3 at the same time is sane enough to be a good option, yet annoying
2016-02-24 10:47:21	greduan	IMO you support one or the other. Thankfully ES6 is backwards compatible so I don't actually have to write ES6
2016-02-24 10:47:21		[10:47]
2016-02-24 10:47:57	mort_	I would write python 2 if OS X let you do #!/usr/bin/env python2, but afaik, it only has python
2016-02-24 10:48:08	mort_	while #!/usr/bin/env python on my machine is python 3

2016-02-25 11:26:21	josm	you can replace the t400 one at least, I replaced mine with an ssd
2016-02-25 11:26:22	@rocx	'cause you see later models with a price spike and the main reason is the fact they keep pushing for larger hard disks.
2016-02-25 11:26:30	@rocx	yeah, but it's when buying one new.
2016-02-25 11:26:43	@fro	so don't buy new
2016-02-25 11:26:47	@fro	you don't need a new one
2016-02-25 11:26:47	%vypr	stark: ping
2016-02-25 11:26:51	@rocx	fro: point is...
2016-02-25 11:27:04	@fro	you can change the hd out in all of them
2016-02-25 11:27:21	@rocx	yes. but what if i want a higher model with decent specs but still have a smaller hard disk?
2016-02-25 11:27:37	@rocx	i have a hard enough time using 50G on this massive 200G partition.
2016-02-25 11:27:47	@fro	i think smallest in 240 or 256 now
2016-02-25 11:27:50	@fro	was 128
2016-02-25 11:28:00	@fro	i have a 240
2016-02-25 11:28:09	@fro	i don't even use half of it
2016-02-25 11:28:18	@fro	but that doesn't matter
2016-02-25 11:28:23	@fro	space is there if i needed
2016-02-25 11:28:38	%vypr	guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuys
2016-02-25 11:28:43	josm	?
2016-02-25 11:28:49	%vypr	im fucking tired
2016-02-25 11:28:50	@fro	there's no reason to get a smaller one
2016-02-25 11:28:59	@rocx	i never use the space. that's why i go smaller.
2016-02-25 11:29:15	josm	vypr: go to bed?
2016-02-25 11:29:16	@fro	well you're pretty unlikely to get one smaller than 128
2016-02-25 11:29:19	@rocx	so when people complain about consuming all the space on their 2T+ disks, i'm still shocked at how people can be so wasteful.
2016-02-25 11:29:22	%vypr	josm: its 7:29pm
2016-02-25 11:29:29	%vypr	and i woke up 4 hours ago
2016-02-25 11:29:58	@rocx	then again, those people are windows users so of course wastefulness is in their blood.
2016-02-25 11:30:09	@rocx	the kind who think bigger numbers are objectively better in every case.
2016-02-25 11:30:27	josm	vypr: oh, it's 12:30 here so :V
2016-02-25 11:30:34	%vypr	where are you?

2016-02-25 11:32:44	josm	kirby: uk too?
2016-02-25 11:32:52	+fyr	uk best
2016-02-25 11:32:52	%kirby	Yeah
2016-02-25 11:33:00	josm	so that's 3?
2016-02-25 11:33:24	@rocx	josm: we're all over the world. the only place we lack members from is asia and south america.
2016-02-25 11:33:32	@rocx	unless there's a brazilian we haven't heard of.
2016-02-25 11:33:57	josm	mostly USA though, no?
2016-02-25 11:34:01	@rocx	josm: probably.
2016-02-25 11:34:11	%vypr	we have some members from asia
2016-02-25 11:34:14	@rocx	actually i take back my asia comment if you count the middle east/lebanon as asia.
2016-02-25 11:34:15	%vypr	stark is in india
2016-02-25 11:34:17	@fro	i thought it was about equal to EU
2016-02-25 11:34:25	@rocx	vypr: didn't know that.
2016-02-25 11:35:22	@fro	lebanon is in asia
2016-02-25 11:35:22	@fro	so
2016-02-25 11:35:27	@fro	not sure why it wouldn't count as that
2016-02-25 11:35:37	mort_	https://twitter.com/coralineada/status/702594868984459264 well fuck
2016-02-25 11:35:47	@rocx	i usually think of asia as more central and east rather than the west part.
2016-02-25 11:36:04	@fro	well asia is huge
2016-02-25 11:36:12	@rocx	it's just american public schools' geography at work.
2016-02-25 11:36:18	%vypr	hhhhhhh
2016-02-25 11:36:30	@rocx	eeeeeee
2016-02-25 11:36:33	@rocx	yyyyyy
2016-02-25 11:36:43	@fro	mort_: you should be happy about that
2016-02-25 11:36:59	@fro	she won't let anyone be antisemitic and whatnot
2016-02-25 11:37:08	@fro	GET IT!?
2016-02-25 11:37:13	@fro	because you're a jew
2016-02-25 11:37:24	mort_	I'm not sure I get it
2016-02-25 11:37:24	@rocx	i want to see a fight between her and dcat.
2016-02-25 11:37:30	mort_	I don't think I'm a jew
2016-02-25 11:37:43	@fro	i wouldn't know honestly
2016-02-25 11:37:53	@fro	but mort goldman is
2016-02-25 11:38:00	@rocx	well... he does have a big nose...

2016-02-25 11:38:23	@fro	what movie?
2016-02-25 11:38:30	@rocx	The Life of Brian.
2016-02-25 11:38:37	mort_	last I checked, I wasn't really into that god thing
2016-02-25 11:38:48	mort_	isn't that a prerequesit for being a jew?
2016-02-25 11:38:59	@fro	depends on who you ask
2016-02-25 11:39:05	@rocx	not in these days.
2016-02-25 11:39:06	@rocx	all it takes to be a jew is to disagree with someone on certain subjects.
2016-02-25 11:39:13	@rocx	and "certain" is as abstract as it gets
2016-02-25 11:39:14	mort_	ah
2016-02-25 11:39:20	@fro	if your mother is jewish then you're jewish
2016-02-25 11:39:28	@fro	that's how it goes usually
2016-02-25 11:39:30	mort_	I'm cerainly a jew if rocx' definition holds
2016-02-25 11:39:31	@rocx	if you disagree with dcat on some things, you're jewish.
2016-02-25 11:39:41	mort_	my mother isn't a jew though
2016-02-25 11:39:55	mort_	I'm not aware of any jews in my family tree
2016-02-25 11:40:00	@fro	yeah but mort goldman's mom is definitely a jew
2016-02-25 11:40:05	@rocx	are they still hanging the-no wait wrong joke.
2016-02-25 11:40:19	*	rocx shuffles through his offensive joke cards to find something good.
2016-02-25 11:40:23	@fro	i don't even think i know any jews irl
2016-02-25 11:40:34	@fro	at least not personally
2016-02-25 11:40:37	josm	why are we going here
2016-02-25 11:40:38	mort_	why did the baby not scream
2016-02-25 11:40:40	josm	this is a bad idea
2016-02-25 11:41:08	@fro	oh
2016-02-25 11:41:09	mort_	because its head was too far into the blender already
2016-02-25 11:41:16	mort_	see, dead baby jokes always work
2016-02-25 11:41:19	@fro	this is not a safe space, folks

2016-02-25 11:44:06	@rocx	what was the PC time of the '90s?
2016-02-25 11:44:10	@rocx	tell us, grampa fro!
2016-02-25 11:44:12	@fro	didn't seem to last as long and certainly didn't spill over onto the internet
2016-02-25 11:44:46	@fro	the OJ trial distracted everyone and we forgot all about PC
2016-02-25 11:44:57	@rocx	which we all knew he was guilty.

2016-02-25 11:45:39	@fro	it was insane
2016-02-25 11:45:59	@fro	they would never allow that now
2016-02-25 11:46:06	@fro	but i mean
2016-02-25 11:46:13	@fro	they were still paddling us at school then too
2016-02-25 11:47:35	@rocx	they wouldn't allow that now because someone might get offended there was a white person on tv.
2016-02-25 11:47:43	@rocx	and they got rid of tvs in schools.
2016-02-25 11:47:57	@rocx	it's all done through some projector hanging from the ceiling.
2016-02-25 11:48:33	@rocx	so in senior year, we missed cramming in one corner to see what was on the TV for class videos and didn't see any overhead projectors.

2016-02-25 12:58:14	@fro	i loved gnome before that
2016-02-25 12:58:21	@fro	but fuck those stupid big ass icons
2016-02-25 12:58:26	@fro	i don't want that
2016-02-25 12:58:28	@rocx	GNOME was functional even with a mouse/board.
2016-02-25 12:58:30	@fro	i use a mouse
2016-02-25 12:58:32	lazr	have you tried gnome classic
2016-02-25 12:58:34	@fro	or keyboard

2016-02-25 12:58:42	@rocx	fro: part of the idea is to not be running too much crap and use the workspaces.
2016-02-25 12:58:49	@fro	but don't make it default like that
2016-02-25 12:58:50	@rocx	and the icons shrink the more you're running.
2016-02-25 12:58:52	@fro	give me a choice
2016-02-25 12:58:52	lazr	it's not bad but not enough customization

2016-02-25 12:59:29	@rocx	but it's very usable with a mouse and keyboard.
2016-02-25 12:59:31	lazr	I used a mac today to print out resumes
2016-02-25 12:59:44	lazr	I was like eh

2016-02-25 13:00:04	@fro	i like some of the new features too
2016-02-25 13:00:08	@rocx	if you think that's bad, wait 'til you see how popular MS Word for Mac is.
2016-02-25 13:00:10	@fro	just not the weird touch-related ones
2016-02-25 13:00:17	@fro	also

2016-02-25 13:00:29	@fro	but
2016-02-25 13:00:33	@fro	i don't see that as a computer
2016-02-25 13:00:41	@fro	i'm just using it to watch netflix and shit
2016-02-25 13:01:06	lazr	fro what do you use a "computer" for then
2016-02-25 13:01:10	lazr	what qualifies that
2016-02-25 13:01:14	lazr	genuinely curious
2016-02-25 13:02:19	@fro	good question
2016-02-25 13:02:22	%adam	vypr: updated
2016-02-25 13:02:27	@fro	and i guess it depends
2016-02-25 13:02:36	@fro	to communicate on irc
2016-02-25 13:02:42	@fro	to research
2016-02-25 13:02:43	%adam	and watch porn
2016-02-25 13:02:48	@fro	eh
2016-02-25 13:02:53	@fro	i can watch porn on my phone now
2016-02-25 13:02:57	lazr	so If i made an IRC client for apple tv
2016-02-25 13:03:00	@fro	airplay to apple tv too
2016-02-25 13:03:01	@fro	sup
2016-02-25 13:03:22	@fro	i don't think i can use a keyboard with that yet
2016-02-25 13:03:35	%adam	you can watch porn though
2016-02-25 13:03:51	@fro	siri won't search for porn probably
2016-02-25 13:03:54	@fro	i should test it
2016-02-25 13:04:04	lazr	guys let me ask you something semi serious
2016-02-25 13:04:08	%vypr	adam: nice, nice
2016-02-25 13:04:11	%vypr	lazr: go for it
2016-02-25 13:04:25	lazr	have you seen that reddit post where terry crews was like "I have a porn addiction"
2016-02-25 13:04:43	lazr	I honestly don't understand how people can think of porn as a bad thing
2016-02-25 13:04:58	%vypr	well
2016-02-25 13:05:02	%vypr	depends on how you consume it
2016-02-25 13:05:03	lazr	like does it honestly get in your way that much where it's an addiction?
2016-02-25 13:05:08	%vypr	yes, actually
2016-02-25 13:05:13	lazr	I
2016-02-25 13:05:13	%vypr	it can get that far
2016-02-25 13:05:14	%adam	for example
2016-02-25 13:05:16	%vypr	not me personally
2016-02-25 13:05:18	%adam	im watching it right now
2016-02-25 13:05:23	%vypr	but i do know people who have such things
2016-02-25 13:05:37	lazr	I guess I just don't understand their struggle
2016-02-25 13:05:50	lazr	but hey I support him with the battles he chooses
2016-02-25 13:06:15	lazr	i mean you want to watch less porn go for it
2016-02-25 13:07:01	lazr	I just feel like it's nothing to be ashamed of
2016-02-25 13:07:25	@rocx	lazr: if you wanted an example, you should've been here an hour or so ago.
2016-02-25 13:07:39	lazr	what happen
2016-02-25 13:07:43	@fro	so
2016-02-25 13:07:55	@fro	i can google image search from siri for nude photos
2016-02-25 13:08:00	fsociety	i guess here are the problems with porn addiction, it can lead to expectations of sex that may never be fulfilled by your partner
2016-02-25 13:08:03	@fro	but if i use the word porn in anything she won't respond
2016-02-25 13:08:06	@fro	lame
2016-02-25 13:08:09	@rocx	lazr: the problem is more of a hentai addiction.
2016-02-25 13:08:19	fsociety	or an addiction can cause issues when maybe someone prefers the company of porn to their partner
2016-02-25 13:08:22	@rocx	there was an intervention an hour ago.
2016-02-25 13:09:53	lazr	I guess I just have never experienced that
2016-02-25 13:10:01	lazr	rocx: an intervention???
2016-02-25 13:11:07	lazr	I guess I just don't think of it as a problem. I don't mind, say, my gf consuming porn
2016-02-25 13:11:19	lazr	hell I'd like to consume it with her
2016-02-25 13:11:26	%adam	HEYO

2016-02-25 20:03:36	josm	but there's literally nothing there

2016-02-25 20:12:03	%vypr	python might've poop'd

2016-02-26 01:50:54	seth	i3pystatus requires Python 3.2 or newer and is not compatible with Python 2.x. Some modules require additional dependencies documented in the docs.
2016-02-26 01:51:26	josm	I tried python3 though?

2016-02-26 03:43:40	@venam	I made some ascii arts some years back and I don't remember how to output them correctly
2016-02-26 03:43:46	@venam	https://github.com/venam/Ascii-Arts/raw/master/robot1
2016-02-26 03:43:49	@venam	that one for example
2016-02-26 03:47:54	greduan	cat
2016-02-26 03:47:55	greduan	kappa
2016-02-26 03:48:49	@venam	greduan: doesn't work
2016-02-26 03:48:56	@venam	I remember I used to do something with echo -e
2016-02-26 03:49:24	greduan	all right it's pomodoro time, see you guys in 25 mins
2016-02-26 03:49:51	@rocx	`less -l`
2016-02-26 03:49:58	@rocx	*`less -R`
2016-02-26 03:50:04	@rocx	or whatever it is.
2016-02-26 03:50:15	@rocx	yeah. -R
2016-02-26 03:51:37	@rocx	wow.
2016-02-26 03:51:52	@rocx	DDG even returns clojars.org when searching for a clojure library.
2016-02-26 03:51:56	@rocx	in the fast results.
2016-02-26 03:52:08	josm	DDG is the best
2016-02-26 03:54:36	sol	nm: /usr/lib/libflowcanvas.so: no symbols
2016-02-26 03:54:39	sol	can this be normal?
2016-02-26 03:55:09	sol	getting linker errors like  undefined reference to `FlowCanvas::Module::Module(......

2016-02-26 03:55:32	@rocx	i get that on other libraries too.
2016-02-26 03:56:54	@venam	why does it remove whitespace when I echo
2016-02-26 03:57:07	@venam	damn, how could I forget how to output my own ascii art
2016-02-26 03:59:14	seth	kirby: Gingonic for golang

2016-02-26 03:59:46	seth	or expressjs might be easier, dunno
2016-02-26 04:00:10	josm	express \o/
2016-02-26 04:00:23	josm	koa is the way forward though if starting new things
2016-02-26 04:00:38	@venam	why does it compress my spaces when I echo
2016-02-26 04:02:13	greduan	DDG *is* the best
2016-02-26 04:02:30	greduan	it just doesn't have as much man power or time as Google to figure out the best results
2016-02-26 04:02:36	greduan	venam: magic
2016-02-26 04:03:02	@rocx	greduan: yet the reason it did a better job at searching was why i switched to it from bing.

2016-02-26 04:05:37	neo	i'm new to irc, btw
2016-02-26 04:05:46	@venam	works: while read -r line; do echo -e $line; done < robot1
2016-02-26 04:06:03	@venam	but I have to add something at the begining of the line otherwise it doesn't output the first whitespaces

2016-02-26 04:11:53	@rocx	venam: thought it was romanian
2016-02-26 04:12:02	@rocx	yeah. nailed it.
2016-02-26 04:12:13	%kirby	We had a guy called neo a while ago, are you him?
2016-02-26 04:12:13	neo	+1 random useless points for you
2016-02-26 04:12:17	%kirby	Or a new neo?

2016-02-26 04:12:33	neo	i'm the new neo, not the one who died
2016-02-26 04:12:39	neo	in the last movie
2016-02-26 04:12:45	@venam	ah, third movie
2016-02-26 04:12:47	@venam	makes sense
2016-02-26 04:12:48	%kirby	Spoilers!
2016-02-26 04:12:56	neo	you should see the movie :)
2016-02-26 04:13:21	%kirby	I actually haven't seen any of the Matrices though I knid of know what happens in the first.
2016-02-26 04:13:24	neo	i think it's a good idea to switch to the old handle, tudurom. this is not too original...
2016-02-26 04:13:26	%kirby	And that nobody likes the next two.
2016-02-26 04:14:04	neo	The next two are pretty good, but they are not that philosophical
2016-02-26 04:14:21	neo	they are more adventurous
2016-02-26 04:16:58	@venam	the robots are epic though
2016-02-26 04:17:06	@venam	you gotta admit

2016-02-26 04:20:24	josm	:V
2016-02-26 04:20:30	neo	btw i'm finishing a crux install in a vm. can somebody give me a few pointers please?
2016-02-26 04:20:52	@venam	neo: install stuffs and work on it
2016-02-26 04:20:58	josm	never used crux, so I can't help. Basically everyone else can though.
2016-02-26 04:21:18	neo	what are you using, then? just askin'
2016-02-26 04:21:20	@venam	does anyone wanna help me polish my reddit theme?
2016-02-26 04:21:43	josm	neo: void linux
2016-02-26 04:22:22	@venam	neo: parabola favorite machine, debian Jessie on other box and on a VPS, cent OS on another VPS, and ubuntu at work and
2016-02-26 04:22:25	@venam	some others VPS
2016-02-26 04:22:46	josm	oh yeah my vps
2016-02-26 04:22:55	neo	i tried void, but it looks too young for me
2016-02-26 04:22:58	josm	used to have arch on it before DI got rid of it
2016-02-26 04:23:03	josm	debian 8 now
2016-02-26 04:23:07	neo	i WANT to get rid of arch!
2016-02-26 04:23:30	josm	neo: it's nice, but yeah, some things are a pain to use
2016-02-26 04:23:48	neo	now compiling openssl in a vm and i must say crux is like me: pretty chill and simple
2016-02-26 04:24:12	josm	it's one of the simplest
2016-02-26 04:24:40	neo	i like this simple aproach. i can complicate the system myself this way.
2016-02-26 04:25:43	josm	what arch was *meant* to be
2016-02-26 04:25:49	josm	or can be still I suppose
2016-02-26 04:25:57	josm	but aur makes you bloody lazy
2016-02-26 04:26:07	josm	which is why I switched, along with other reasons
2016-02-26 04:26:24	neo	what's wrong with the aur?
2016-02-26 04:26:31	josm	it makes you lazy
2016-02-26 04:26:55	neo	crux, on the other sides, comes with nothing
2016-02-26 04:26:57	josm	there's nothing "wrong" with it though
2016-02-26 04:27:13	neo	you say the aur is not healthy for your mind
2016-02-26 04:27:20	josm	try void in a vm, it's kind of in-between
2016-02-26 04:27:51	neo	tried it. i like the good parts and hate the bad parts
2016-02-26 04:28:06	neo	and this is why i'm trying crux and i like it
2016-02-26 04:28:33	josm	fair enough
2016-02-26 04:29:25	neo	crux's official repo uses rsync, i think. it's bloody slow
2016-02-26 04:29:52	josm	you'd have to ask someone else, as I said, never used crux
2016-02-26 04:29:58	@venam	while read -r line; do echo -e $line; done < $1
2016-02-26 04:30:07	@venam	why when I do that in a script it eats back the spaces
2016-02-26 04:30:18	@venam	makes not sense it works from the command line directly
2016-02-26 04:30:21	neo	what do you mean?
2016-02-26 04:30:30	neo	about "eating back the spaces"
2016-02-26 04:30:37	josm	unix - the everlasting "why?"
2016-02-26 04:31:03	neo	and the everlasting satisfying feel when you get the answer
2016-02-26 04:31:12	josm	idd

2016-02-26 04:42:47	josm	?
2016-02-26 04:42:50	@rocx	Today, I learned that Adobe gave up Flex to Apache. Flex is free software now.
2016-02-26 04:43:00	josm	Flex?
2016-02-26 04:43:05	@rocx	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flex
2016-02-26 04:43:18	neo	since when?
2016-02-26 04:43:20	@rocx	2012.
2016-02-26 04:43:33	@rocx	when i looked into this kind of mumbo jumbo, it was still adobe flex.

2016-02-26 05:54:53	+fyr	anyway
2016-02-26 05:55:15	+fyr	the bar, the colours, the fetch script

2016-02-26 05:55:35	+fyr	 it's a nice style
2016-02-26 05:55:43	neo	dylan doesn't have any bar!
2016-02-26 05:55:54	neo	the colours are heavily modified
2016-02-26 05:56:01	neo	the fetch script is partly mine
2016-02-26 05:56:04	+fyr	also is that i3?

2016-02-26 05:56:42	neo	but dylan has no bar...

2016-02-26 08:48:19	lazr	can you get there via tor
2016-02-26 08:48:26	@z3bra	I'll try another tunnel
2016-02-26 08:48:43	@z3bra	still not
2016-02-26 08:48:58	@z3bra	using unix.chat as a tunneled host
2016-02-26 08:49:23	@z3bra	A valid Host header must be supplied to reach the desired website.
2016-02-26 08:49:30	@z3bra	that might be due to the tunnel
2016-02-26 08:55:54	seth	z3bra: that's interesting

2016-02-26 08:59:08	TaylanTatli	guys i changed pacman progressbar but i don't know if i done this right because i don't know anything about c. can you check this for me, just a few line. https://gist.github.com/TaylanTatli/e813c2560b0f1ecc9f5d#file-pacman-patch
2016-02-26 08:59:18	@rocx	oi! 'oo're yoo?
2016-02-26 08:59:53	lazr	uh what if we don't have those characters
2016-02-26 09:00:09	lazr	not every font has those characters TaylanTatli 
2016-02-26 09:00:29	TaylanTatli	but it's just for me and my font have these
2016-02-26 09:00:30	@rocx	lazr: the box drawing chars?
2016-02-26 09:00:34	lazr	yes
2016-02-26 09:00:41	@rocx	you have a terrible font if you lack them.
2016-02-26 09:01:08	lazr	Not my fault if it did. But Pacman shouldn't have to take account of that stuff
2016-02-26 09:01:13	lazr	ya know
2016-02-26 09:01:26	lazr	now he just said he wasn't gonna upstream this so I am like go for it 
2016-02-26 09:01:51	lazr	if he did want to that would be a problem but it's his own patch so honestly I don't care
2016-02-26 09:01:59	lazr	it looks nice
2016-02-26 09:02:21	@rocx	besides, [||||||   ] looks like a better bar.
2016-02-26 09:02:31	TaylanTatli	lazr: thanks. so code is ok?
2016-02-26 09:02:39	*	rocx shrugs.
2016-02-26 09:02:47	TaylanTatli	rocx: i just tried, if it's ok i can change whenever i want
2016-02-26 09:03:23	lazr	I would make all of those things puts
2016-02-26 09:03:26	lazr	probably
2016-02-26 09:03:33	lazr	but that's just me 
2016-02-26 09:03:49	lazr	there's no point in using fputs just to go and say "oh to stdout"
2016-02-26 09:03:57	lazr	puts does that for you
2016-02-26 09:04:00	lazr	you know
2016-02-26 09:04:21	TaylanTatli	i don't know diffrences between them, but others always give a new line this was ok
2016-02-26 09:04:31	lazr	oh that might be a thing
2016-02-26 09:04:42	lazr	puts does do a newline sorry
2016-02-26 09:05:00	lazr	yeah this is fine I guess there's not much of a choice going on
2016-02-26 09:05:14	TaylanTatli	lazr: ah, ok then. thank you
2016-02-26 09:05:18	lazr	it would be nice if pacman had a setting for this
2016-02-26 09:05:26	lazr	like in ncmpcpp to set the bar
2016-02-26 09:05:38	TaylanTatli	it has a ILoveCandy thing but i don't like
2016-02-26 09:05:43	lazr	barchars = "[| ]
2016-02-26 09:05:49	lazr	or whatever
2016-02-26 09:05:53	lazr	I might add that
2016-02-26 09:06:04	lazr	yeah it's a joke about pacman the game
2016-02-26 09:06:08	TaylanTatli	that would be cool if you can
2016-02-26 09:06:17	TaylanTatli	yea i know
2016-02-26 09:06:44	lazr	I will check it out and see if I can

2016-02-26 09:09:25	@z3bra	just use default
2016-02-26 09:10:03	@z3bra	my life improved greatly when I realized that settings are about removing annoying features, not adding funny ones
2016-02-26 09:10:16	lazr	good philosophy
2016-02-26 09:10:54	@rocx	z3bra: or making the existing feature toolset better.
2016-02-26 09:11:12	@z3bra	nope
2016-02-26 09:11:18	@rocx	rood
2016-02-26 09:11:22	@z3bra	actually, you can get "used" to thing
2016-02-26 09:11:26	@z3bra	I mean
2016-02-26 09:11:35	@z3bra	for example, I use vis
2016-02-26 09:11:38	@z3bra	instead of vim
2016-02-26 09:12:03	@z3bra	I could easily tweak some keybinds to reproduce my old vim workflow
2016-02-26 09:12:19	@z3bra	but getting used to the new way of doing things isn't that bad
2016-02-26 09:12:42	@z3bra	eg, using multiple cursors instead of visual block mode
2016-02-26 09:17:13	@z3bra	or resisting the urge of putting vi keybinds everywhere :P
2016-02-26 09:17:18	@z3bra	that was the hardest 
2016-02-26 09:18:50	@z3bra	xero, do you have a server?
2016-02-26 09:53:43	@rocx	i'd rather have something work the way i want it rather than have to recondition myself to a specific set of standards and ways.

2016-02-26 10:56:24	Halfwit	(well, when I buy a second monitor again)
2016-02-26 10:56:38	greduan	vypr: really cool map
2016-02-26 10:56:49	greduan	and I get better FPS on it than on others so I can bring my A AWP game
2016-02-26 10:57:03	greduan	i.e. hold off an eco rush with an AWP :^)
2016-02-26 10:57:09	lazr	yeah I have a weird ass monitor setup so i was the perfect person to make it :3
2016-02-26 10:57:36	lazr	I am planning a C port to be added to wmutils/opt
2016-02-26 10:59:14	Halfwit	Very nice work
2016-02-26 10:59:27	lazr	thank you
2016-02-26 11:07:01	Halfwit	lazr: Do you by chance use st? I haven't gone through and figured exactly what's blocking me getting a decent name from wname. 
2016-02-26 11:07:09	lazr	I use urxvt
2016-02-26 11:07:11	lazr	sorry

2016-02-26 11:07:29	*	Halfwit scripted around it for now
2016-02-26 11:08:30	Halfwit	I think I recall z3bra having st, when I was creeping like a stalker through their scripts.
2016-02-26 11:08:45	lazr	no that's why we have the scripts out there
2016-02-26 11:08:49	lazr	so you can do that
2016-02-26 11:09:13	Halfwit	It's actually quite a source of inspiration, fwiw.
2016-02-26 11:11:54	lazr	yeah I steal ideas from people all the time
2016-02-26 11:12:13	lazr	I love looking at clean ass dotfiles
2016-02-26 11:38:14	Halfwit	Of all the interpretations that one could have for `clean ass dotfiles`, I'll take the high road.
2016-02-26 11:47:20	+neeasade	oh
2016-02-26 12:01:59	Halfwit	Heh, cool. My little clip is one of the first results for wmutils

2016-02-26 18:59:31	@venam	how did you remove the old one?
2016-02-26 18:59:58	Halfwit	Basically you set a styles.css 
2016-02-26 19:00:06	Halfwit	I am beginning to assume it needs overrides though.
2016-02-26 19:00:09	@venam	nah, inspect elements
2016-02-26 19:00:13	@venam	it's webkit based, right?

2016-02-26 19:06:39	@venam	otherwise using one of those browser would push you away
2016-02-26 19:06:40	Halfwit	I wouldn't use this browser for that.
2016-02-26 19:07:03	@venam	Halfwit: we had that discussion on nixers more than once

2016-02-27 03:09:29	@xero	wow. best vim plugin i have found in a while
2016-02-27 03:09:30	@xero	http://www.gregsexton.org/portfolio/gitv/
2016-02-27 03:09:37	@xero	it's basically gitk for vim
2016-02-27 03:10:07	greduan	you guys and your fancy vim plugins
2016-02-27 03:11:13	@xero	says the guy talking about emacs all week
2016-02-27 03:11:34	greduan	Emacs is meant to have fancy shit
2016-02-27 03:11:36	@rocx	greduan: fixing to say, us and our fancy emacs packages.
2016-02-27 03:11:48	@rocx	vim kind of does as well, hence the fact it's extensible.
2016-02-27 03:11:50	@rocx	...to a point.
2016-02-27 03:11:54	greduan	My vim usage, i.e. main editor usage, is limited to customizing motions/operators/text-objects
2016-02-27 03:12:19	greduan	like not limited to that
2016-02-27 03:12:26	greduan	but that's the reason any vim-like editor falls short
2016-02-27 03:12:36	greduan	cause I can't customize their fucking operators/motions/text-objects easily. lol
2016-02-27 03:12:38	@xero	take a look at this output: http://pub.iotek.org/p/qppr3Az.png
2016-02-27 03:12:48	@xero	i use vimdiff a lot aready
2016-02-27 03:13:01	@xero	being able to use it agains any commit in the tree is super nice
2016-02-27 03:13:08	@xero	and will save me lots of time 
2016-02-27 03:13:23	greduan	Git somehow is very bad for me for 3way merges, which is what I use it mostly for.
2016-02-27 03:13:29	greduan	vimdiff just gives you a git diff in vim?
2016-02-27 03:13:39	greduan	You could use :Gdiff from Pathogen, just sayin
2016-02-27 03:13:53	@xero	vimdiff is baked into vim already
2016-02-27 03:13:56	greduan	oh ok
2016-02-27 03:14:01	@xero	you need for another tool
2016-02-27 03:14:05	@xero	*no need
2016-02-27 03:14:44	@xero	i use vimdiff as my merge tool as well
2016-02-27 03:14:47	@xero	it's very nice
2016-02-27 03:15:17	@xero	i resolve most of my conflicts from that view as well
2016-02-27 03:15:24	@xero	all inside a single editor session

2016-02-27 03:27:07	greduan	I see
2016-02-27 03:27:16	greduan	I tend to keep my text editor explicitly for text editing
2016-02-27 03:27:18	greduan	nothing else
2016-02-27 03:28:28	@xero	you what merge tool do you use?
2016-02-27 03:29:01	greduan	Basically nothing. I edit the file directly
2016-02-27 03:29:14	@xero	no wonder you have issues with 3way merges then
2016-02-27 03:29:17	@xero	so ineffeciant
2016-02-27 03:29:21	greduan	I mean ofc
2016-02-27 03:29:35	greduan	but when I try to use vim as my git difftool it doesn't work out
2016-02-27 03:30:27	@xero	i just added
2016-02-27 03:30:35	@xero	[diff]
2016-02-27 03:30:39	@xero	  tool = vimdiff
2016-02-27 03:30:45	@xero	to my .gitconif
2016-02-27 03:30:52	@xero	same w/ [merge]
2016-02-27 03:30:59	@xero	there's not really much else to it
2016-02-27 03:31:21	@xero	beyond that it's just using vim. 
2016-02-27 03:31:33	@xero	and when you're done it passes the results to git
2016-02-27 03:35:15	greduan	TFW you use git status instead of ls and you realize you use Git too much. lol

2016-02-27 05:25:16	@rocx	is the best way not to unless you need a file to exist via editor?

2016-02-27 05:25:25	+fyr	eh
2016-02-27 05:25:28	+fyr	:> ?
2016-02-27 05:25:36	dcat	yes
2016-02-27 05:25:40	dcat	create an empty file
2016-02-27 05:25:41	@rocx	isn't that because : is true for some sort?
2016-02-27 05:25:50	@rocx	so it's more or less `true >file`?
2016-02-27 05:26:05	dcat	rocx
2016-02-27 05:26:06	+fyr	oh okay that's actually handy, ty teacher dcat 
2016-02-27 05:26:09	dcat	think fast
2016-02-27 05:26:13	*	rocx catches it.
2016-02-27 05:26:23	dcat	what's the correct way to check if your statement is true?
2016-02-27 05:26:34	dcat	as in; how do you check if `true` and `:` is the same?
2016-02-27 05:26:56	@rocx	...okay this is a little beyond me. 
2016-02-27 05:27:02	@rocx	`which :`?
2016-02-27 05:27:13	thlst	... `true && :` ?
2016-02-27 05:27:25	dcat	: && echo "it's the same" || echo "rocx was wrong"
2016-02-27 05:27:35	dcat	thlst was close
2016-02-27 05:27:57	dcat	&& == $? = 0
2016-02-27 05:28:03	dcat	|| == $? != 0
2016-02-27 05:28:32	@rocx	ah, $? is return code.
2016-02-27 05:28:55	dcat	so it could be written as
2016-02-27 05:28:57	dcat	: ; [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "it's the same" || echo "rocx was wrong"
2016-02-27 05:29:00	@rocx	it's been a while since i dabbled with the shell.

2016-02-27 05:30:58	+fyr	lemonbar clickable areas don't seem accurate :/
2016-02-27 05:31:01	@rocx	yeah so touch would be semantically wrong.
2016-02-27 05:31:24	dcat	it would be more wrong than opening it with an editor
2016-02-27 05:31:54	@rocx	dcat: the point of the editor comment was to not create an empty file at all and enter whatever information in it instead if need be.
2016-02-27 05:32:01	@rocx	only when it was needed.
2016-02-27 05:32:29	@rocx	like you'd `vi somecode.rb` for example and write it in if you wanted a Ruby program at the time rather than creating a blank file of that name.
2016-02-27 05:32:59	@z3bra	yo there
2016-02-27 05:33:06	@rocx	and here comes the z3bubu
2016-02-27 05:33:52	Halfwit	dcat: Ah, I see what you guys are getting at, all of the aforemntioned don't need to invoke external functions 
2016-02-27 05:34:12	@z3bra	":" is a shell alias for "true"
2016-02-27 05:34:32	@z3bra	but to create an empty file, the best solution is:
2016-02-27 05:34:34	@z3bra	>file
2016-02-27 05:34:39	@z3bra	no need for a command
2016-02-27 05:34:41	@z3bra	BUT
2016-02-27 05:34:57	@rocx	BUT why make an empty file?
2016-02-27 05:34:57	@z3bra	some shell don't support that. so the 2nd easiest thing is
2016-02-27 05:34:59	@z3bra	:>file
2016-02-27 05:35:09	@rocx	z3bra: what shell doesn't support that?
2016-02-27 05:35:13	@z3bra	which is garanteed to work in all posix shells
2016-02-27 05:35:13	dcat	>file
2016-02-27 05:35:15	dcat	and
2016-02-27 05:35:17	dcat	<file
2016-02-27 05:35:19	dcat	is zsh syntax
2016-02-27 05:35:24	@rocx	fV:
2016-02-27 05:35:25	@z3bra	<file is
2016-02-27 05:35:27	@z3bra	>file isn't
2016-02-27 05:35:48	@rocx	works in `sh`.
2016-02-27 05:35:58	@z3bra	works with zsh, dash, mksh and bash
2016-02-27 05:36:17	@rocx	where are you going to find something that isn't `dash` to be as close to POSIX?
2016-02-27 05:36:39	@z3bra	>file
2016-02-27 05:36:48	@z3bra	 this syntax is not defined by posix
2016-02-27 05:36:59	dcat	^
2016-02-27 05:37:00	@z3bra	*explicitely*
2016-02-27 05:37:05	@z3bra	so it's implementation specific
2016-02-27 05:37:06	dcat	and ...
2016-02-27 05:37:07	@xero	rocx: iirc sh (dash), resh, & ksh  are the most posix
2016-02-27 05:37:25	dcat	you don't want UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR do you?
2016-02-27 05:37:25	@rocx	xero: which of those does `>file` not work in?
2016-02-27 05:37:38	@z3bra	csh maybe
2016-02-27 05:37:44	@rocx	screw csh.
2016-02-27 05:37:44	@xero	i dont have them all installed at work so idk
2016-02-27 05:37:47	dcat	wat
2016-02-27 05:37:55	dcat	z3bra: was that a reply to rocx?
2016-02-27 05:38:00	@rocx	yeah.
2016-02-27 05:38:07	dcat	go suck a dick z3bra
2016-02-27 05:38:20	dcat	csh is not even close
2016-02-27 05:38:34	@z3bra	it's close enough to me making a joke
2016-02-27 05:38:35	@z3bra	I think

2016-02-27 05:39:38	@rocx	`>file` works in ksh.

2016-02-27 05:39:52	@z3bra	but.
2016-02-27 05:39:55	@rocx	OKAY CRAP never mind `sh` on my system's bound to `bash`.

2016-02-27 05:41:49	@xero	busybox sh is `ash` right?
2016-02-27 05:41:55	@rocx	honestly if it works in all of the major shells that are POSIX-compliant, then it's good.

2016-02-27 05:43:06	@rocx	`printf "$*\n" should be good enough.
2016-02-27 05:43:18	@xero	rocx: meh. as long as you use no flags it is posix

2016-02-27 05:44:20	@z3bra	I see
2016-02-27 05:44:40	dcat	and that's true z3bra
2016-02-27 05:44:54	@rocx	heck, even in later Unix generations (eg. Plan 9, Inferno), some programs were just wrappers written in a shell syntax.
2016-02-27 05:45:22	dcat	if used without any command, it should redirect the shell itself
2016-02-27 05:45:32	@z3bra	dcat, let's think on the practical coding
2016-02-27 05:45:35	dcat	exec >myfile
2016-02-27 05:45:57	@z3bra	command arg > file
2016-02-27 05:46:03	@z3bra	how would you process this?
2016-02-27 05:46:11	@z3bra	you NEED a file descriptor
2016-02-27 05:46:16	dcat	what do you mean, process it?
2016-02-27 05:46:24	@z3bra	to have a file descriptor, you need a file
2016-02-27 05:46:31	dcat	correct
2016-02-27 05:47:00	@z3bra	you would then use fopen("file", "w");
2016-02-27 05:47:05	@z3bra	so the file will get created
2016-02-27 05:47:13	@z3bra	you then have your fd
2016-02-27 05:47:28	@z3bra	now you can parse the command, replacing fd "1" by your fd
2016-02-27 05:47:32	@z3bra	oh look!
2016-02-27 05:47:36	@z3bra	no command
2016-02-27 05:47:37	@z3bra	:
2016-02-27 05:47:45	@z3bra	let's just clean up
2016-02-27 05:47:49	@z3bra	fclose(fd);
2016-02-27 05:47:51	@z3bra	and bam
2016-02-27 05:47:55	@z3bra	you get a file for free
2016-02-27 05:48:19	@z3bra	now SOME shells might decide to parse the whole line first
2016-02-27 05:48:26	@z3bra	and THEN decide what to do
2016-02-27 05:48:27	@z3bra	like
2016-02-27 05:48:55	@z3bra	if (has_command) {
2016-02-27 05:48:55	@z3bra	    if(has_redir) {
2016-02-27 05:48:55	@z3bra	        ...
2016-02-27 05:49:08	@z3bra	that would be innefficient for no reason right?

2016-02-27 06:26:41	@rocx	adam: hack has some pretty bad sizes on my end.
2016-02-27 06:26:44	@xero	i kinda like roboto mono
2016-02-27 06:26:48	@rocx	like the 'u' and 'n' are different sizes.
2016-02-27 06:26:52	chc4	i use dejavu sans mono

2016-02-27 06:32:38	@rocx	xero: you know i'm too short to reach the top shelf and we lack the ladders and stepstools to get there.
2016-02-27 06:32:58	@rocx	guess the best we can do at this point is pretend to take turns stabbing him.

2016-02-27 06:36:38	@z3bra	fun.
2016-02-27 06:37:06	@z3bra	I was trying it with tee

2016-02-27 07:12:36	neo	an irc bot that executes bash script in a jail
2016-02-27 07:13:01	@rocx	so like what freenode/#bash has?

2016-02-27 07:13:48	@rocx	there was regx, which used to substitute text someone said.

2016-02-27 07:14:45	@rocx	<regx> < dweeb>: send it up to my butt
2016-02-27 07:15:36	@xero	rocx: bare metal is where the os or vm is installed directly on the hardware, as opposed to installing a vm inside a host os (e.g. the cloud)
2016-02-27 07:15:48	@rocx	xero: figured. how does that work?
2016-02-27 07:15:58	@rocx	they have a bunch of small cheap computing apparatus?
2016-02-27 07:16:11	@xero	depends on the cost, but yes
2016-02-27 07:16:16	@rocx	huh.
2016-02-27 07:16:19	@xero	some server farms have beefy machines
2016-02-27 07:16:26	@xero	others cheep, other a mix
2016-02-27 07:16:47	@xero	in cloud setups it's just a ton of machines that have their resources pooled
2016-02-27 07:16:55	@rocx	so...

2016-02-27 07:48:00	@rocx	eh.

2016-02-27 07:48:43	%adam	is it "safe" to completely remove os x from a mac?
2016-02-27 07:48:55	dcat	what do you mean by safe?
2016-02-27 07:49:09	@xero	adam: https://github.com/pandeiro/arch-on-air#14-create-boot-file-structure
2016-02-27 07:49:14	%adam	i saw a few threads state that you need OS X to keep the EFI firmware updated
2016-02-27 07:49:16	@xero	most important part if you want to dual book
2016-02-27 07:49:29	%adam	i cant dual boot
2016-02-27 07:49:32	%adam	not till i get home
2016-02-27 07:49:35	@xero	but if you dont dual book it doesnt matter
2016-02-27 07:49:43	%adam	at least
2016-02-27 07:49:52	dcat	well yeah, but why would you need the efi updates?
2016-02-27 07:50:05	%adam	i mean
2016-02-27 07:50:06	@xero	but if you loose those files you'll have to wipe, reinstall osx, then do it all over again
2016-02-27 07:50:13	%adam	isnt it wise to keep that firmware up to date?
2016-02-27 07:50:26	@xero	arch handles my eufi boot
2016-02-27 07:50:41	@xero	osx has that .plist so it still works
2016-02-27 07:50:52	%adam	so linux only is fine?
2016-02-27 07:50:53	@xero	but i almost never boot there at work anymore
2016-02-27 07:51:03	%adam	hrm
2016-02-27 07:51:07	@xero	adam: yes, if you dont ever want to go back to osx
2016-02-27 07:51:19	dcat	you can run whatever you want on your macbook
2016-02-27 07:51:26	dcat	I run osx cause I paid for it
2016-02-27 07:51:54	@xero	AH! FOUND IT! https://github.com/moxie0/chapcrack
2016-02-27 07:52:02	dcat	running a commercial unix system is a good idea imo

2016-02-27 08:37:55	@rocx	and the display is terrible.
2016-02-27 08:38:06	@rocx	why don't they make computers like they used to?
2016-02-27 08:38:11	@rocx	a laptop without the display.
2016-02-27 08:38:37	@xero	rocx: you could make a tiny headless box w/ a battery
2016-02-27 08:38:48	@xero	but then you're at the mercy of finding a display

2016-02-27 08:41:41	@xero	remove the screen and hinge and make a nice headless system
2016-02-27 08:41:45	@rocx	i was just making a proposal, not actually do it.
2016-02-27 08:42:02	@rocx	and quasi-related, would it be a good idea to invest in an Intel NUC?
2016-02-27 08:42:14	@xero	i have only used one
2016-02-27 08:42:18	@xero	and it was pretty bad ass
2016-02-27 08:42:22	@rocx	i'm skeptical of intel crap because of that stupid thing they have in processors now where you can remotely control it.
2016-02-27 08:42:40	@xero	i blame mac users
2016-02-27 08:43:07	@rocx	yeah, i'd go for a NUC.
2016-02-27 08:43:19	@rocx	oh wow, the RPi3 to have wi-fi and bluetooth.

2016-02-28 03:22:21	mort_	is it just me or does xdg-open seem kind of over-engineered

2016-02-28 03:34:57	dcat	and you shot me down

2016-02-28 03:35:23	mort_	you're not very good at expressing yourself clearly are you
2016-02-28 03:37:22	dcat	clearly
2016-02-28 03:37:39	boobah	mort_: isn't that something that should depend on your file manager or program launcher?
2016-02-28 03:37:41	dcat	would you mind borrowing me some of your communication skills?
2016-02-28 03:37:49	dcat	you seem to have an abundance of it
2016-02-28 03:37:51	boobah	guys, c'mon
2016-02-28 03:38:08	mort_	xdg-open isn't really related to any particular file manager
2016-02-28 03:38:27	mort_	file managers may use xdg-open on the other hand to open files in the correct application
2016-02-28 03:38:35	boobah	yeah, but i'm saying you could easily script something and just tell your FM to use that
2016-02-28 03:38:38	Halfwit	mort_: What i've done is use `file -biL $1`
2016-02-28 03:38:46	boobah	^^ that sounds good
2016-02-28 03:38:47	Halfwit	It's so far been alright
2016-02-28 03:38:48	dcat	here's the solution
2016-02-28 03:38:52	dcat	just get the mimetype
2016-02-28 03:39:04	dcat	and go through it in a switch statement in shell
2016-02-28 03:39:41	Halfwit	That's what I do :/
2016-02-28 03:39:46	dcat	yes
2016-02-28 03:39:46	mort_	what's file -bil supposed to do?
2016-02-28 03:39:49	dcat	noticed I was late
2016-02-28 03:39:51	dcat	oh ohohoh

2016-02-28 03:39:56	Halfwit	I'd use plumber, but I'm not cool enough.
2016-02-28 03:39:59	dcat	use the man pages mort
2016-02-28 03:40:25	arc	brief mimetype list mort_ 
2016-02-28 03:40:31	dcat	arc pls
2016-02-28 03:40:34	arc	from the almighty manpage
2016-02-28 03:40:40	mort_	what good does it help to have a list of mimetypes
2016-02-28 03:40:45	Halfwit	That was a damn teachable moment
2016-02-28 03:40:46	dcat	lel
2016-02-28 03:40:54	mort_	it doesn't exactly change xdg-open does it
2016-02-28 03:41:11	boobah	lol
2016-02-28 03:41:14	mort_	the $1 also doesn't seem to do anything

2016-02-28 03:41:30	boobah	no, but just call your script "xdg-open" and no one will know :)
2016-02-28 03:41:36	+Halfwit	That's a shell variable :3
2016-02-28 03:41:49	dcat	that's the honorary badge of "I'm not a dummy"
2016-02-28 03:41:50	boobah	mort_: have you written shell scripts before?
2016-02-28 03:41:54	dcat	afk
2016-02-28 03:41:57	mort_	but I'm struggling to see how `file -bil` is relevant
2016-02-28 03:42:04	boobah	it gets the mime type
2016-02-28 03:42:09	mort_	no it doesn't?
2016-02-28 03:42:11	mort_	http://pbin.in/KS
2016-02-28 03:42:18	mort_	is the output of `file -bil somefile.jpg`
2016-02-28 03:42:31	boobah	i'd leave out the `-l`, personally.
2016-02-28 03:42:44	mort_	that makes more sense
2016-02-28 03:43:17	mort_	but even so, now I have a mime type. I don't need a mime type, I need to change how xdg-open treats certain mime types.
2016-02-28 03:43:39	boobah	yeah. technically the information was in there all along, albeit a bit buried. 'image/jpeg' is what you're looking for in that case.
2016-02-28 03:43:41	mort_	which is xdg-mime default someprogram.desktop some/mimetype
2016-02-28 03:44:04	mort_	I already found the mime type with `xdg-mime query filetype somefile`though
2016-02-28 03:44:11	boobah	i'm suggesting ditching xdg- stuff because it's over-engineered as you said yourself
2016-02-28 03:44:23	mort_	maybe
2016-02-28 03:44:43	boobah	just write a script and call it xdg-open if you can't get your file manager or whatever to switch what launcher it uses
2016-02-28 03:45:04	boobah	i should write one too, this is useful
2016-02-28 03:45:18	+Halfwit	L != l
2016-02-28 03:45:22	mort_	it would be useful to be able to use xdg-open in my own scripts though
2016-02-28 03:45:45	mort_	but I won't do that if there's not even a way to set the default application for all video types, which there doesn't seem to be
2016-02-28 03:45:49	mort_	also, xml config files...
2016-02-28 03:46:52	boobah	Halfwit: my bad, i was looking at mort_'s post
2016-02-28 03:47:22	boobah	in that case, `-biL` should be sufficient
2016-02-28 03:47:54	boobah	mort_: i'm tellin' ya, it's cancer
2016-02-28 03:49:54	mort_	I don't really need to know a mime type, I already know it's video files and will probably open in whatever video player
2016-02-28 03:50:08	mort_	would just be useful to not hard code what video player it uses, and instead use the default video player
2016-02-28 03:50:57	mort_	hard coding mpv would be the easiest thing ever, but if I'm say on Ubuntu, I probably won't want it to open in mpv because ubuntu has (or at least had, not sure now) an ancient version of mpv installed which didn't even have a graphical overlay
2016-02-28 03:51:24	boobah	that's funny
2016-02-28 03:51:33	boobah	sounds like mplayer
2016-02-28 03:52:57	+Halfwit	Oh scary
2016-02-28 03:53:07	+Halfwit	Arch has a fairly stable stack for mpv

2016-02-28 04:02:28	boobah	okay, nice. yeah, that'd be a good addition.
2016-02-28 04:02:52	boobah	and thanks, i try to keep my code clean :)
2016-02-28 04:03:10	mort_	boobah: that looks a lot more sane than xdg-open
2016-02-28 04:04:05	boobah	yeah, i like it better too. thanks for the idea, i think i'm gonna use something like this now
2016-02-28 04:04:09	mort_	http://pbin.in/7q
2016-02-28 04:04:28	boobah	jesus
2016-02-28 04:04:32	mort_	huh, I wonder why xdg-open has code specific to various desktop environments
2016-02-28 04:04:42	boobah	i didn't even know xdg-open was a shell script
2016-02-28 04:04:44	mort_	that seems completely unnecessary and ugly
2016-02-28 04:05:26	+Halfwit	boobah: I've done the better part of a plumber at this point, though in hindsight, I'd just use the plan9 port.
2016-02-28 04:06:12	mort_	so, xdg-open is hard coded to run gvfs-open if it's on gnome, exo-open if on xfce, etc, that seems like kind of weird design

2016-03-01 09:14:55	@rocx	or fart around and continue learning me a clojure.
2016-03-01 09:15:00	josm	sounds awesome :V
2016-03-01 09:15:10	josm	what's so awesome about clojure then?
2016-03-01 09:15:15	@rocx	it's lisp.
2016-03-01 09:15:27	josm	I thought it was java?
2016-03-01 09:15:29	josm	wat
2016-03-01 09:15:31	@rocx	it's for the JVM.
2016-03-01 09:15:33	@rocx	but it's lisp
2016-03-01 09:15:43	josm	wat
2016-03-01 09:15:57	@rocx	the JVM is the virtual machine java compiles into.
2016-03-01 09:16:08	@rocx	other languages take advantage of the JVM, like scala and clojure

2016-03-01 09:16:47	josm	right I see
2016-03-01 09:17:41	@rocx	though if it falls through, i got common lisp to fall back to.
2016-03-01 09:18:00	josm	and here I am as a js/node and python scrub
2016-03-01 09:18:03	@rocx	except that i might have to delve through a ton of japanese documentation just to find the snippet that would help.
2016-03-01 09:18:09	@rocx	josm: clojurescript and hy.
2016-03-01 09:18:33	@rocx	stick around and you'll definitel learn what our language biases are.
2016-03-01 09:19:11	@rocx	i'm the lisp guy, chc4_'s the hoon/rust guy, adam's the C/plan 9 guy, the rest are a bit of a grab bag.
2016-03-01 09:19:30	@rocx	oh, and a couple of other node guys.
2016-03-01 09:20:44	josm	yeah I know there is

2016-03-01 09:27:32	%adam	like
2016-03-01 09:27:43	%adam	all the pro devs ive worked with or talked to like, shit on it
2016-03-01 09:27:46	@xero	i have my own framework. so it's really quick for me to bootstrap a site or api
2016-03-01 09:27:46	%adam	but like
2016-03-01 09:27:52	%adam	like
2016-03-01 09:27:55	%adam	youre a really good web dev
2016-03-01 09:27:56	%adam	and
2016-03-01 09:28:00	%adam	so are they like
2016-03-01 09:28:03	%adam	are you like php jesus
2016-03-01 09:28:08	@xero	he're the thing dude
2016-03-01 09:28:12	@xero	1.) people talk shit
2016-03-01 09:28:17	@xero	period.
2016-03-01 09:28:25	@xero	it can be for lots of reasons
2016-03-01 09:28:29	@xero	(e.g. ignorance)
2016-03-01 09:28:39	josm	php gets a bad press it's true
2016-03-01 09:28:44	@xero	2.) it's VERY easy to write shite php code
2016-03-01 09:28:49	josm	if you're used to it just use it I say
2016-03-01 09:28:52	@xero	like easier than any other lang i've used
2016-03-01 09:28:59	@xero	except for maybe javascript
2016-03-01 09:29:17	@xero	php can be procedural, classical, functional... how ever you want to write it
2016-03-01 09:29:26	@xero	it's that lack of 
2016-03-01 09:29:28	@xero	"urls
2016-03-01 09:29:39	@xero	*rules* that scare most devs
2016-03-01 09:29:52	@xero	they want a var to be casted to a type and be that type forever
2016-03-01 09:30:11	@xero	they want errors for type corrosion
2016-03-01 09:30:16	@xero	but not php
2016-03-01 09:30:20	@xero	$i=0
2016-03-01 09:30:30	%adam	so to me, it seems like, if i may make this connection, php is like the C of web development
2016-03-01 09:30:31	@xero	$i="dog"
2016-03-01 09:31:03	@xero	they made it simple in the beginning, and it's suffered from feature creep quite a bit

2016-03-01 10:28:33	@rocx	wow. bad idea putting my backlight to 1.
2016-03-01 10:28:35	@rocx	1%.
2016-03-01 10:28:50	@rocx	my display's more like a mirror than a display.
2016-03-01 10:30:06	greduan	that's my MBP display WITH good backlight
2016-03-01 10:30:15	greduan	this fucking screen is the best mirror I've ever seen in a computer
2016-03-01 10:30:23	greduan	and also the Apple LED Cinema Display
2016-03-01 10:30:37	greduan	I often use this thing as a mirror, just open a black terminal firs.t lol
2016-03-01 10:30:42	@rocx	the only con is that it makes the forum hard to read.
2016-03-01 10:30:59	@rocx	but yet my theme is decent enough i can still make out the text.
2016-03-01 10:31:34	@rocx	go me?
2016-03-01 10:32:36	greduan	lol
2016-03-01 10:32:37	@rocx	greduan: you hand-coded the gruvbox theme for emacs, right?
2016-03-01 10:32:50	greduan	pretty much, a guy had figured out a big part of it already
2016-03-01 10:33:20	@rocx	there sure are a lot of faces in these modes.
2016-03-01 10:33:26	greduan	lol
2016-03-01 10:33:29	greduan	ye
2016-03-01 10:33:34	greduan	it's good though, IMO
2016-03-01 10:34:05	@rocx	greduan: https://github.com/rocx/shale-theme and i'll get there eventually.
2016-03-01 10:34:52	@rocx	greduan: you used the `C-u C-x =` chored to figure faces out?

2016-03-01 10:48:57	greduan	I don't remember
2016-03-01 10:49:15	greduan	most of the time I looked at the source code directly looking for the available faces

2016-03-01 10:58:29	@rocx	tmux.
2016-03-01 10:59:24	greduan	I really wish we used IRC at work
2016-03-01 10:59:29	greduan	cause goddamn Slack is distracting AF
2016-03-01 10:59:31	greduan	srsly
2016-03-01 10:59:31	@rocx	instead of being a slack weenie?
2016-03-01 10:59:50	josm	can't you use slack in an irc client greduan?
2016-03-01 10:59:54	halfwit	rocx: Yeah. I don't need the terminal multiplexing part, heh.
2016-03-01 10:59:59	@rocx	josm: whoever runs the part has to enable it.
2016-03-01 11:00:00	greduan	josm: probs, I hear it's a mess though
2016-03-01 11:00:07	josm	I see
2016-03-01 11:00:16	halfwit	rocx: It always makes me chuckle that I'd use so much from Tmux, save for it's intended purpose
2016-03-01 11:00:22	@rocx	greduan: well why don't you find out it's a mess or not?
2016-03-01 11:00:30	greduan	I'm too lazy dude. .ol
2016-03-01 11:00:45	@rocx	halfwit: it's intended purpose? it's a multiplexer. that feature mainly comes in handy via ssh.
2016-03-01 11:00:58	halfwit	rocx: I know
2016-03-01 11:01:22	@rocx	maybe save for a stray xterm, i keep an ansi-term buffer up.
2016-03-01 11:02:13	@rocx	okay this is getting too meta.
2016-03-01 11:02:27	%adam	i prefer systemd-term-multiplex

2016-03-01 11:07:39	@rocx	all the other fonts are too thin and geometric for my tastes.
2016-03-01 11:07:52	@rocx	and screw bitmap fonts.

2016-03-01 15:03:19	josm	kills shit
2016-03-01 15:03:25	josm	like everyone else
2016-03-01 15:03:26	rocx	iunno man what does an engineer do in real life?
2016-03-01 15:03:42	@fro	dragons?
2016-03-01 15:03:47	josm	..kinda
2016-03-01 15:03:54	halfwit	Draft, model, then wait for parts to come back based on the prototypes!
2016-03-01 15:04:03	halfwit	...for 1D4 damage. 
2016-03-01 15:04:07	josm	I'd have to explain the entire game to you :V
2016-03-01 15:04:08	rocx	halfwit: ...in two seconds flat but yes exactly!
2016-03-01 15:04:42	rocx	josm: you're fighting a losing battle here.
2016-03-01 15:04:55	rocx	josm: fro's what you call "old" now.
2016-03-01 15:05:00	josm	IT ISN'T DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS OK
2016-03-01 15:05:27	josm	anyway, moving on
2016-03-01 15:05:33	rocx	screw that why is fantasy almost always about medieval or victorian england?
2016-03-01 15:06:08	@fro	there's nothing medieval about fantasy
2016-03-01 15:06:14	@fro	just to be clear
2016-03-01 15:06:17	halfwit	rocx: The mythology is well established :/
2016-03-01 15:06:18	*	rocx adds "new world type colonialism?" into his comic org-file.
2016-03-01 15:06:27	rocx	fro: yeah. it's just how much of it 
2016-03-01 15:06:33	rocx	how much of it's medieval.
2016-03-01 15:06:38	rocx	and heck, based off of Tolkien's works.
2016-03-01 15:06:44	josm	fro: water under the bridge?
2016-03-01 15:06:45	halfwit	That game umm
2016-03-01 15:06:52	halfwit	Destiny
2016-03-01 15:07:02	halfwit	Seemed interesting.
2016-03-01 15:07:03	josm	that was a silly arguement
2016-03-01 15:07:10	rocx	josm: you'll find many of those here.
2016-03-01 15:07:18	josm	halfwit: most expensive game in history btw
2016-03-01 15:07:28	josm	rocx: I gathered
2016-03-01 15:07:30	rocx	you know what need to come back?
2016-03-01 15:07:33	rocx	real arcade games.
2016-03-01 15:07:34	halfwit	Seems like the phrase "You're being pedantic" is implied here
2016-03-01 15:08:17	halfwit	With more commas
2016-03-01 15:08:18	rocx	bah. now i have to hit the hay and finish a paper in twelve hours.
2016-03-01 15:08:31	josm	good luck rocx
2016-03-01 15:09:02	halfwit	josm: That's probable, it was fucking Bungie. 
2016-03-01 15:09:27	josm	halfwit: no it literally was, they spent the most amount of money making it
2016-03-01 15:09:35	josm	and then it flopped
2016-03-01 15:09:36	rocx	wow.
2016-03-01 15:09:45	rocx	why do video games have to be that kind of expensive to make?
2016-03-01 15:09:50	rocx	why do they need all these people working on it?
2016-03-01 15:09:58	rocx	why not make video games, iunno, SIMPLE AGAIN?
2016-03-01 15:10:02	josm	cause it's a big business now
2016-03-01 15:10:10	josm	you old man you
2016-03-01 15:10:12	josm	:>
2016-03-01 15:10:23	rocx	josm: oi i grew up with video games mind you.
2016-03-01 15:10:27	halfwit	They make them complicated, and put a non-technical person on the lead, who gets fed stories of frameworks that tehy ought to use
2016-03-01 15:10:29	josm	haha
2016-03-01 15:10:32	*	rocx pats the Sega Genesis on his dresser.
2016-03-01 15:10:37	halfwit	rocx: We had Pong
2016-03-01 15:10:37	josm	oh
2016-03-01 15:10:43	josm	so you're the same age as me
2016-03-01 15:10:46	josm	...maybe
2016-03-01 15:10:46	rocx	i mean for Diablo III, you should sit there for the credits.
2016-03-01 15:10:52	rocx	it's a thirty minute long credit.
2016-03-01 15:10:57	halfwit	It is, yeah. 
2016-03-01 15:11:09	josm	I had the Sega MegaDrive, which is the EU/UK version of the genesis
2016-03-01 15:11:21	josm	infact it's still in my room
2016-03-01 15:11:24	rocx	josm: granted, i'm more of an arcade fan now, but SIMPLE GAMES. WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET?
2016-03-01 15:11:36	josm	I get what you mean
2016-03-01 15:11:40	fsociety	the reason that games are big business now is due to tech that they create for a given project
2016-03-01 15:11:41	halfwit	Just Retroarch it up with a bunch of Roms.
2016-03-01 15:11:54	fsociety	not to mention the costs of using motion capture studios, actors, etc
2016-03-01 15:11:55	rocx	instead of silly platformers, we have to have these in-depth shooting and role-playing games that take 10hr and 160hr to beat, respectively.
2016-03-01 15:11:58	josm	I'm still a sucker for big games though, as you know

2016-03-01 15:15:35	halfwit	For longer scripts, that interoperate with a few programs, python really starts to shine
2016-03-01 15:15:52	halfwit	But don't make a fucking *cough* Qutebrowser *cough* browser in it.

2016-03-02 11:48:29	arc	you need to build through docker and then get the rootfs

2016-03-02 11:56:28	halfwit	Every third word by some
2016-03-02 11:56:32	@fro	they all have similar price points
2016-03-02 11:56:44	@fro	most of them let you do more than DO
2016-03-02 11:56:48	halfwit	I like the output, heh. 
2016-03-02 11:57:32	arc	it's slightly less storage than a DO $5 but it can run alpine

2016-03-02 12:37:56	@rocx	now it's not facing any.
2016-03-02 12:38:15	@rocx	it's a metric ton better than some el cheapo no-name not-even-ISO-layout board.
2016-03-02 12:38:35	@rocx	the one i had to use for a while because the '6' key died in one phase.

2016-03-02 12:40:44	josm	I showed you one with a trackpoint
2016-03-02 12:40:46	@rocx	3) HHKB's layout.

2016-03-02 13:46:48	%vypr	for some reason
2016-03-02 13:46:57	%adam	probably yes, but i'd have to learn the project's dev process
2016-03-02 13:47:10	%adam	and their coding style possibly, and id have to find something that needs to be worked on
2016-03-02 13:47:30	%adam	perhaps the distro project will help me do that better

2016-03-02 13:48:13	@fro	well
2016-03-02 13:48:18	rocx	i mean just 'cause i wrote the style guide and all...
2016-03-02 13:48:21	@fro	maybe if you get enough people to work on things
2016-03-02 13:48:30	@fro	and someone can manage and delegate tasks properly
2016-03-02 13:48:38	@fro	you could actually get a working distro

2016-03-02 15:28:42	%adam	thats more or less the course
2016-03-02 15:28:59	halfwit	Algorithms are important
2016-03-02 15:29:12	rocx	yes.
2016-03-02 15:29:15	halfwit	At least you get that out of it!
2016-03-02 15:29:29	halfwit	Language is much less important, so I mean, you're still learning useful things 
2016-03-02 15:31:53	%adam	i suppose so
2016-03-02 15:31:56	%adam	im off to bed though
2016-03-02 15:31:59	halfwit	adam: o/
2016-03-02 15:31:59	%adam	good night
2016-03-02 15:32:42	halfwit	There's a bunch of literature on the matter, even a book: "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs"
2016-03-02 15:32:48	halfwit	It's Wirth a look.

2016-03-02 16:05:41	@fro	how is that any different than usual?
2016-03-02 16:05:54	@fro	greduan is just now old enough to notice i guess?
2016-03-02 16:06:09	halfwit	fro: Yeah.
2016-03-02 16:07:00	greduan	lol
2016-03-02 16:07:00	greduan	whether I notice it or not, I just don't really care
2016-03-02 16:07:00	greduan	but man USA must have some reputation now for choosing obviously bad presidents
2016-03-02 16:07:21	halfwit	They choose the media darlings heh
2016-03-02 16:08:02	@fro	i think it's cute that you think the elections in your country are somehow different
2016-03-02 16:08:26	halfwit	Never said that, it's the same in Canada
2016-03-02 16:08:28	@fro	also today didn't choose any candidates
2016-03-02 16:08:40	halfwit	Actually, this was "not Harper" more than anything else.
2016-03-02 16:08:49	%vypr	greduan: what are you talking about
2016-03-02 16:08:53	@fro	mainly talking to greduan
2016-03-02 16:09:32	halfwit	fro: Harper was a pretty good economist, but he really lacked humanity :(
2016-03-02 16:10:31	@fro	yeah i man
2016-03-02 16:10:38	@fro	i'm sure reagan was good at something too
2016-03-02 16:10:44	halfwit	Lol
2016-03-02 16:10:45	@fro	mean*
2016-03-02 16:10:49	@fro	maybe acting?
2016-03-02 16:11:59	greduan	fro: I know they didn't choose any candidates. and I do not think my country is any better. lol
2016-03-02 16:12:22	greduan	But the US is supposedly a "better" country than Mexico, so it probably shouldn't commit those sorts of mistakes. lol
2016-03-02 16:12:40	halfwit	Iceland seems to be interesting, but that's only on a cursory look
2016-03-02 16:13:15	@fro	better in terms of what exactly? there really isn't any reason to compare mexico to the US
2016-03-02 16:13:25	@fro	they're both countries and that's about the only thing they have in common
2016-03-02 16:13:37	rocx	they're both in north america.
2016-03-02 16:13:42	rocx	and they're not under water.
2016-03-02 16:13:45	rocx	and they're on Earth
2016-03-02 16:13:56	rocx	and people run them.
2016-03-02 16:14:04	halfwit	Not robots :(
2016-03-02 16:14:09	rocx	that part will differ depending on who you ask.

2016-03-02 22:19:52	+fyr	hey z3bra the closet script breaks when you set ignw on a window and you're still on it
2016-03-02 22:20:01	+fyr	will investigate
2016-03-02 22:25:21	@z3bra	yo
2016-03-02 22:25:30	@z3bra	how does it break?
2016-03-02 22:27:50	+fyr	the first sed part doesn't work
2016-03-02 22:39:01	+fyr	ah I know why
2016-03-02 22:39:28	+fyr	lsw never reports pfw when override_redirect is set
2016-03-02 22:40:46	@z3bra	yeah
2016-03-02 22:40:51	@z3bra	that's the whole point
2016-03-02 22:40:53	@z3bra	lsw -o
2016-03-02 22:41:09	@z3bra	to get windows with override_redirect
2016-03-02 22:41:14	@z3bra	lsw -a to list everything
2016-03-02 22:41:25	+fyr	mm
2016-03-02 22:41:57	+fyr	maybe lsw could have an option to report pfw always regardless of overrider_redirect
2016-03-02 22:42:12	@z3bra	I don't think so
2016-03-02 22:42:22	+fyr	oh?
2016-03-02 22:42:29	@z3bra	lsw is not supposed to treat pfw as a "special" window
2016-03-02 22:42:43	@z3bra	to get the current window, you can use "pfw"
2016-03-02 22:42:54	+fyr	no
2016-03-02 22:42:59	+fyr	that's not what I meant
2016-03-02 22:43:15	+fyr	something like lsw -p
2016-03-02 22:43:27	+fyr	which will produce normal lsw output
2016-03-02 22:43:41	+fyr	along with the pfw if overrider_redirect is set on it
2016-03-02 22:43:53	@z3bra	(lsw;pfw)|sort|uniq
2016-03-02 22:44:21	*	fyr lies down
2016-03-02 22:44:23	*	fyr tries not to cry
2016-03-02 22:44:27	*	fyr cries alot
2016-03-02 22:44:34	@z3bra	your -p option is treating the current window as a special window
2016-03-02 22:46:01	+fyr	well that solution works for me pretty well
2016-03-02 22:46:17	@z3bra	which one?
2016-03-02 22:46:19	@z3bra	-p ?
2016-03-02 22:46:27	@z3bra	you patched lsw already?
2016-03-02 22:46:30	+fyr	nah the (lsw; pfw) | sort | uniq
2016-03-02 22:46:33	@z3bra	ah
2016-03-02 22:46:38	@z3bra	of course it does
2016-03-02 22:46:40	@z3bra	:)
2016-03-02 22:46:42	+fyr	,)
2016-03-02 22:46:45	@z3bra	and to be fair
2016-03-02 22:46:54	@z3bra	the sort/uniq part is overkill
2016-03-02 22:47:23	@z3bra	maybe
2016-03-02 22:47:33	@z3bra	depends on how sed behaves
2016-03-02 22:47:34	+fyr	well I just want closest.sh to work if override_redirect was set
2016-03-02 22:47:44	@z3bra	fair enough
2016-03-02 22:48:13	@z3bra	why would you set igwn on your current window btw?
2016-03-02 22:48:22	@z3bra	ignw
2016-03-02 22:48:37	+fyr	ah I'm gonna create a 'hover.sh' script
2016-03-02 22:48:59	+fyr	where you can set a window to be ignored and placed in a certain geometry on the screen

2016-03-03 02:20:17	feute	so what's new in the wmutils world
2016-03-03 02:22:23	+fyr	writing a much smarter groups script

2016-03-03 02:22:31	+fyr	it's nearly done completely
2016-03-03 02:22:45	@xero	i'm still fine tuning my multi-head script
2016-03-03 02:22:47	+fyr	but just want to add in wgroups -M functionality
2016-03-03 02:22:48	feute	what do you mean by smarter?
2016-03-03 02:22:52	@xero	which ties into all my other ones
2016-03-03 02:22:56	+fyr	feute, sec

2016-03-03 02:24:49	sshbio_	fyr: But wait: wmutils can not be used stand alone can it?
2016-03-03 02:25:02	@xero	sshbio_: imo it's best used standalone
2016-03-03 02:25:06	@xero	all you need is X
2016-03-03 02:25:21	@xero	but you can use it w/ other simple wms
2016-03-03 02:25:24	feute	and xwait
2016-03-03 02:25:40	@xero	xwait i just an infite loop
2016-03-03 02:25:41	sshbio_	Oh but I spent multiple hours looking on the web for exacly this!
2016-03-03 02:25:48	@xero	commonly used to hold open the x session
2016-03-03 02:25:51	@xero	but you can use anything
2016-03-03 02:26:01	feute	yeah 
2016-03-03 02:27:38	+fyr	http://wildefyr.net/media/groups.mp4
2016-03-03 02:27:41	+fyr	warning: I talk
2016-03-03 02:28:08	sshbio_	I think I will switch very soon!  If fyr is dcat I really liked swm as well!
2016-03-03 02:28:17	+fyr	ahahahahahahahahahah
2016-03-03 02:28:27	+fyr	dcat != fyr
2016-03-03 02:28:30	+fyr	he wishes
2016-03-03 02:28:39	sshbio_	Ah ^^
2016-03-03 02:28:48	feute	lol
2016-03-03 02:29:03	feute	dcat is dcat, fyr is fyr
2016-03-03 02:29:27	sshbio_	this was due to the last commit.  I just must _read_
2016-03-03 02:29:37	@xero	fyr: very nice
2016-03-03 02:29:45	thlst	fyr: what a sexy voice
2016-03-03 02:30:14	+fyr	oh also I forgot to mention if I add a wid to an inactive group it'll autohide it
2016-03-03 02:30:15	@xero	what are you using for mouse focus? (not that i really want that) swm?
2016-03-03 02:30:26	+fyr	mouse.sh
2016-03-03 02:30:37	@xero	oh. 
2016-03-03 02:30:37	@xero	lel
2016-03-03 02:30:56	+fyr	scripts can source it and then can move the mouse
2016-03-03 02:31:13	+fyr	see my focus.sh
2016-03-03 02:31:23	@xero	is it sloppy? or click driven?
2016-03-03 02:31:33	+fyr	sloppy
2016-03-03 02:31:36	@xero	:/
2016-03-03 02:31:42	+fyr	wait
2016-03-03 02:31:44	@xero	i hate sloppy focus
2016-03-03 02:31:45	+fyr	how do you mean
2016-03-03 02:31:54	@xero	where when you just mouse over things it focuses
2016-03-03 02:32:02	+fyr	oh no
2016-03-03 02:32:08	+fyr	it's not sloppy
2016-03-03 02:32:12	+fyr	I hate that too
2016-03-03 02:32:17	sshbio_	fyr: Oh, you are the one that made fyre WM with sh scripts and wm utils! I remember now!
2016-03-03 02:32:17	thlst	doesn't seem to be focus btw
2016-03-03 02:32:28	thlst	sloppy*
2016-03-03 02:32:29	+fyr	sshbio_, ,)
2016-03-03 02:32:47	+fyr	nah it just moves the mouse when I change windows with focus.sh
2016-03-03 02:33:38	feute	okay i can't see the video
2016-03-03 02:33:40	feute	my computer sucks
2016-03-03 02:33:44	+fyr	use mpv
2016-03-03 02:33:52	+fyr	mpv http://wildefyr.net/media/groups.mp4
2016-03-03 02:34:05	+fyr	ur web browser might not have mp4 codec support
2016-03-03 02:34:07	feute	8mb of integrated video is not good enough
2016-03-03 02:34:11	feute	i used mpv
2016-03-03 02:34:15	+fyr	damn
2016-03-03 02:34:17	@xero	weies
2016-03-03 02:34:21	@xero	weird
2016-03-03 02:34:23	+fyr	it's only a 1080p recording
2016-03-03 02:34:32	@xero	worked great w/ mpv here
2016-03-03 02:34:37	+fyr	file is 23M
2016-03-03 02:35:05	@xero	also works in chromium+inox
2016-03-03 02:35:10	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-03 02:35:17	feute	yeah i know but my computer can't lol
2016-03-03 02:35:27	feute	is it similar to cwm's group?
2016-03-03 02:35:42	+fyr	sec I'll record a small webm
2016-03-03 02:37:31	sshbio_	This looks so nice!
2016-03-03 02:38:14	+fyr	feute, http://wildefyr.net/media/groupSmall.webm
2016-03-03 02:38:21	+fyr	only 3M
2016-03-03 02:41:04	feute	i can't see the difference between that and contrib/groups.sh
2016-03-03 02:41:23	feute	i was watching the first video you sent but it was slow and i couldn't hear you explaining
2016-03-03 02:41:24	@xero	uugghh
2016-03-03 02:41:32	@xero	i dont want to dis greauden
2016-03-03 02:41:38	@xero	but that group script is not great
2016-03-03 02:41:59	sshbio_	But my screen is too small for more than one window at a time.  Or I can with a tiny font!
2016-03-03 02:42:38	+fyr	feute, basically the toggle flag is much smarter
2016-03-03 02:42:43	@xero	lemon, lime, creep... i'd use these fonts if they were not so small. so maybe they're for you
2016-03-03 02:43:14	+fyr	sec I want to finish off this function, when I do I'll commit it
2016-03-03 02:43:35	feute	okay
2016-03-03 02:43:35	sshbio_	xero: I use the tewi one I discovered from your pose about vim.  :)
2016-03-03 02:43:43	feute	maybe i'll get it if i see some code
2016-03-03 02:43:56	sshbio_	but I meant something like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sshbio/miniwi/master/screenshot.png
2016-03-03 02:43:57	+fyr	probably not
2016-03-03 02:44:04	+fyr	the function is super complicated
2016-03-03 02:44:29	@xero	sshbio_: ouch
2016-03-03 02:44:34	@xero	that hurts my eyes/brain
2016-03-03 02:45:10	sshbio_	I do not use it fortunately!  But it is nice for pipes.sh
2016-03-03 02:45:18	@xero	http://ssh.bio/
2016-03-03 02:45:21	@xero	what a domain bro
2016-03-03 02:45:39	+fyr	I wanna get a new domain
2016-03-03 02:45:42	feute	sshbio_: LOL wtf is that
2016-03-03 02:45:47	+fyr	http://wildefyr.net is too tame
2016-03-03 02:45:55	feute	fyr: nvm, just show me
2016-03-03 02:46:05	feute	wildefyr.awesome
2016-03-03 02:46:06	sshbio_	xero Thank you!

2016-03-03 02:47:05	@xero	fyr: since you're so into shell scripting get: fyr.sh
2016-03-03 02:47:21	sshbio_	feute: about the font or the site/domain
2016-03-03 02:47:52	feute	sshbio_: the whole screenshot
2016-03-03 02:48:14	+fyr	xero, yes

2016-03-03 02:58:10	feute	fyr: i see now
2016-03-03 02:58:14	+fyr	the lack of them
2016-03-03 02:58:23	sshbio_	xero: hehe!  I am now back to vim again.
2016-03-03 02:58:36	feute	sshbio_: it's not that, it looks ...
2016-03-03 02:58:50	feute	fyr: nah, i did understand something
2016-03-03 02:59:06	feute	# add group to active if group doesn't exist <-
2016-03-03 02:59:26	feute	no no 
2016-03-03 02:59:28	feute	not that
2016-03-03 02:59:36	feute	# hide wid if group is curently hidden <- that one
2016-03-03 02:59:52	+fyr	oh
2016-03-03 03:00:02	+fyr	if I add a window to an inactive group
2016-03-03 03:00:09	+fyr	it'll autohide the window
2016-03-03 03:00:36	feute	yeah it's like 'sending window to workspace'
2016-03-03 03:00:46	+fyr	kinda
2016-03-03 03:01:09	@xero	that's the stuff im working on still for my multihead script
2016-03-03 03:01:26	+fyr	sry I don't have another screen xero 
2016-03-03 03:01:34	@xero	no worries
2016-03-03 03:01:38	+fyr	otherwise I'd have a solution for you :p
2016-03-03 03:02:07	feute	it looks strange the way you use printf
2016-03-03 03:02:42	@xero	you mean the correct way?
2016-03-03 03:02:59	feute	hm
2016-03-03 03:03:02	feute	instead of: printf '%s\n' "group ${groupNum} visible!"
2016-03-03 03:03:08	@xero	printf format arguments
2016-03-03 03:03:34	feute	why not: printf 'group %s visible!\n' "${groupNum}"
2016-03-03 03:03:44	+fyr	what
2016-03-03 03:03:47	+fyr	the
2016-03-03 03:03:49	+fyr	fuck
2016-03-03 03:03:55	+fyr	is
2016-03-03 03:03:56	+fyr	that
2016-03-03 03:03:58	+fyr	shit
2016-03-03 03:04:41	feute	isn't that how you use formatted print?
2016-03-03 03:04:58	+fyr	no
2016-03-03 03:05:03	@fro	hello
2016-03-03 03:05:09	+fyr	dcat, teach feute 
2016-03-03 03:05:09	thlst	fro: heh
2016-03-03 03:05:37	@xero	also $groupnum is fine
2016-03-03 03:05:38	feute	yeah teach me, that's the way i kow lol
2016-03-03 03:05:43	@xero	no need for "{}"
2016-03-03 03:05:44	feute	but
2016-03-03 03:05:49	+fyr	xero, yeah I am getting into good habits
2016-03-03 03:06:00	feute	printf "%s\n" seems stupid for me, in that case i juse use echo
2016-03-03 03:06:09	@xero	fyr: i was talking to feute
2016-03-03 03:06:16	thlst	feute: oh boy, don't say that
2016-03-03 03:06:18	@xero	he passed a single argument
2016-03-03 03:06:23	+fyr	ah
2016-03-03 03:06:25	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-03 03:06:37	+fyr	feute, echo sucks ass
2016-03-03 03:06:38	@xero	in your example fyr it that part of a larger string
2016-03-03 03:06:40	@xero	so more logical
2016-03-03 03:06:42	+fyr	yes
2016-03-03 03:07:02	feute	hmm
2016-03-03 03:07:05	feute	i don't know
2016-03-03 03:07:08	feute	i'm not convinced
2016-03-03 03:07:25	@xero	echo is deprecated
2016-03-03 03:07:33	@xero	printf is more feature packed
2016-03-03 03:07:43	+fyr	also echo can vary in implementation heavily
2016-03-03 03:07:43	@xero	and has less gnu weirdness associated w/ it
2016-03-03 03:08:04	halfwit	You're unconvinced because no one gave you a logical reason why format strings should have anything but formatting in them
2016-03-03 03:08:08	feute	i'm not convinced the way fyr uses it lol
2016-03-03 03:08:55	 > 	Lola (xeom@Clk-EC5B5216.range31-48.btcentralplus.com) has joined #nixers
2016-03-03 03:08:56	+fyr	works for me
2016-03-03 03:09:10	+fyr	always gives me the behaviour I want
2016-03-03 03:09:24	@xero	feute: i know it BASH but take a look at every example: http://ss64.com/bash/printf.html
2016-03-03 03:09:34	feute	but is my line wrong? printf 'etc etc %s' '$etc'?
2016-03-03 03:09:47	@xero	no, not necessarily
2016-03-03 03:10:02	@xero	printf "this is %s\n" $state
2016-03-03 03:10:12	+fyr	also if you do printf "string"
2016-03-03 03:10:24	+fyr	if string has a % sign printf will interpret it literally
2016-03-03 03:10:26	feute	examples:
2016-03-03 03:10:28	feute	$ printf "Distance is %5d Miles\n" $distance   
2016-03-03 03:10:29	feute	SEE
2016-03-03 03:10:38	+fyr	no
2016-03-03 03:11:06	feute	http://ss64.com/bash/printf.html says it
2016-03-03 03:11:19	@xero	but the idea is for stuff like this
2016-03-03 03:11:20	@xero	printf "%s\n" "1" "2" "\n3"
2016-03-03 03:11:34	@xero	printf "%d\n" 255 0xff 0377 3.5
2016-03-03 03:11:53	+fyr	^
2016-03-03 03:12:02	@xero	make the first option (format) simple 
2016-03-03 03:12:12	@xero	your arguments can vary quite a bit
2016-03-03 03:12:27	@xero	but what feute is saying it not wrong
2016-03-03 03:12:30	@xero	just less flexible
2016-03-03 03:12:31	feute	i think i see the problem
2016-03-03 03:13:16	feute	just checked openbsd man page of printf(1)
2016-03-03 03:13:17	feute	wait
2016-03-03 03:14:30	feute	https://p.iotek.org/z42
2016-03-03 03:14:46	feute	eli5 openbsd
2016-03-03 03:15:14	+fyr	yes
2016-03-03 03:15:19	@xero	indeed
2016-03-03 03:15:23	+fyr	what I kinda mentioned earlier
2016-03-03 03:15:35	@xero	that would be like: printf "my name is $USR"
2016-03-03 03:15:39	feute	nah nah
2016-03-03 03:15:48	feute	happens with c
2016-03-03 03:16:01	@xero	just an example. could happend in shell as well
2016-03-03 03:16:17	@xero	%s is filter before expansion
2016-03-03 03:16:23	@xero	unlike regular vars
2016-03-03 03:16:35	@xero	s/filter/filtered/
2016-03-03 03:17:16	feute	and if you directly get the user's input value from the format string it's a security hole
2016-03-03 03:17:20	feute	i tried it once with c
2016-03-03 03:17:29	feute	passing "%s %d %...."
2016-03-03 03:17:40	feute	it behaves wrong
2016-03-03 03:17:44	@xero	never trust the user
2016-03-03 03:17:51	@xero	always expect attacks
2016-03-03 03:18:02	@xero	you learn that very quickly as as webdev

2016-03-03 03:22:17	sshbio_	That may be why I do not get it.  Oh even curiosity!  What about a job instead.
2016-03-03 03:22:35	@xero	i honestly think cred it the #1 reason'
2016-03-03 03:22:39	@fro	leads to jobs in some cases
2016-03-03 03:22:46	@xero	you look smart and eliet in the hacker scene

2016-03-03 03:31:39	+fyr	opengl-swc sucks
2016-03-03 03:31:50	+fyr	i had better results with just opengl

2016-03-03 03:32:04	@xero	i have an intel card, so i have no idea
2016-03-03 03:32:15	+fyr	tudurom, what nvidia card do you have?
2016-03-03 03:32:17	@xero	trying lots of options and seeing what works is the best
2016-03-03 03:32:30	feute	tudurom: just like playing mortal kombat

2016-03-03 03:33:58	tudurom	came with my t430
2016-03-03 03:34:01	+fyr	see if that works for it
2016-03-03 03:34:32	tudurom	there's no nvidia-settings for some reason
2016-03-03 03:34:37	tudurom	it dissappeared

2016-03-03 03:35:25	rocx	i mean i don't know what i want to learn/use now.
2016-03-03 03:35:40	tudurom	ruby is awesome when you read it. when you're trying to write good ruby, you end up writing python
2016-03-03 03:36:03	@xero	any white space centric lang looks horrible imo
2016-03-03 03:36:13	@xero	i need my { ;; }();
2016-03-03 03:36:14	rocx	true...
2016-03-03 03:36:21	tudurom	then use JS
2016-03-03 03:36:27	*	rocx backhands tudurom 
2016-03-03 03:36:38	rocx	we do NOT tolerate that kind of language, young man.
2016-03-03 03:36:40	@xero	tudurom: pls. there are so many langs that work that way other than js
2016-03-03 03:36:46	rocx	go stand in the time-out corner for five minutes.
2016-03-03 03:36:48	@xero	also i do just js all the time
2016-03-03 03:37:12	tudurom	...
2016-03-03 03:37:31	tudurom	perl?
2016-03-03 03:37:44	rocx	eh. i kind of want to do P6 when it's a little more "matured".
2016-03-03 03:37:49	rocx	well, faster.
2016-03-03 03:38:14	tudurom	stick with ruby and write python-ish code
2016-03-03 03:39:21	tudurom	this kind of code: https://github.com/tudurom/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/.scripts/desktop/panel/panel.rb
2016-03-03 03:39:29	tudurom	for a normal rubyist it's horrible
2016-03-03 03:40:05	@xero	oh god
2016-03-03 03:40:13	@xero	passing ruby in #!/bin/bash
2016-03-03 03:40:18	rocx	(ql:quickload :cl-irc)
2016-03-03 03:40:22	rocx	crap wrong buffer
2016-03-03 03:40:27	tudurom	xero: i know that's a big mistake
2016-03-03 03:40:55	tudurom	ok, it's horrible code for everyone
2016-03-03 03:41:05	@xero	lel
2016-03-03 03:41:34	tudurom	and this little gem in panel: #/usr/bin/bash
2016-03-03 03:44:59	+fyr	okay I gotta figure out how to encode using x265
2016-03-03 03:45:16	tudurom	ffmpeg
2016-03-03 03:45:18	greduan	#!/usr/bin/bash

2016-03-03 03:45:44	greduan	COPY THE AUDIO CHANGE THE VIDEO FORMAT
2016-03-03 03:45:53	greduan	right?
2016-03-03 03:45:57	greduan	not format, encoding
2016-03-03 03:45:58	@xero	you got it
2016-03-03 03:46:05	greduan	I'm a genius
2016-03-03 03:46:19	greduan	actually I had to make a feature for one of our products and we're using ffmpeg, so I learnt all that hsit. lol
2016-03-03 03:47:46	+fyr	okay it won't encode an audio stream along with it direct from my mic
2016-03-03 03:47:47	+fyr	gah
2016-03-03 03:48:17	@xero	i alway say encode lossless then reencode it later
2016-03-03 03:48:31	+fyr	yeah it's what I am doing
2016-03-03 03:48:58	+fyr	but the way I am getting the audio x265 doesn't like
2016-03-03 03:48:59	rocx	blast.
2016-03-03 03:49:03	+fyr	works fine for x264

2016-03-03 05:45:56	thang1	my Artificial  Intelligence professor just told me I should go to grad school
2016-03-03 05:46:25	thang1	cause I "have a brilliant mind, [am] self driving, and are a very independent thinker"
2016-03-03 05:46:44	thang1	s/are/[am]/
2016-03-03 05:47:33	thang1	meanwhile I'm semi likely to fail database systems and maybe jewish literature... but at least I'm doing pretty decent in quantum mechanics
2016-03-03 05:48:01	halfwit	thang1: "Einstein failed math"
2016-03-03 05:48:08	halfwit	thang1: and such
2016-03-03 05:48:31	thang1	Einstein was brilliant at math lol
2016-03-03 05:48:37	thang1	dude mastered calculus by the age of 12
2016-03-03 05:49:08	thang1	oh whoops, "before the age of 15", not specifically 12.
2016-03-03 05:49:23	halfwit	I wish we offered QM here
2016-03-03 05:49:40	thang1	QM is super fun. However, it's basically an applied PDE course
2016-03-03 05:49:58	halfwit	Hm.
2016-03-03 05:50:01	thang1	the only real difference is learning about operators and commutators and a surprising amount of linear algebra and lie algebra
2016-03-03 05:50:22	thang1	But as far as physics goes, it's 90% math and 10% "physicky thingz"
2016-03-03 05:50:50	thang1	I failed/bullshitted through every other physics course I've ever had in my life. QM is my first "real" physics class... ever
2016-03-03 05:50:54	halfwit	Yeah. That's the stuff I can't self-learn to save my life
2016-03-03 05:50:57	thang1	I'm doing just fine in it 'cause I have math :p
2016-03-03 05:51:04	halfwit	The maths
2016-03-03 05:51:12	thang1	maths is so fun tho
2016-03-03 05:51:26	thang1	it just requires rigor like CS theory does
2016-03-03 05:51:30	halfwit	Yeah.
2016-03-03 05:51:37	thang1	(hint: CS theory is math. Literally, it's a branch of math)
2016-03-03 05:51:38	halfwit	And tutelage, for me

2016-03-03 05:58:56	sshbio__	I've seen it many time in your screenshots: can tmux be attached on two different terminal and show different windows?
2016-03-03 05:58:58	thang1	it's really pissing me off at this point because being forced to live inside the dorms is what's tanking my grades -__-

2016-03-03 07:31:54	@fro	according to wikipedia
2016-03-03 07:32:07	rocx	was looking it up before a problem needed fixing

2016-03-03 07:33:05	@fro	this makes no sense

2016-03-03 07:33:36	@xero	i wonder if crux was in beta forever first
2016-03-03 07:33:43	@xero	b/c 2002 was the inital release

2016-03-03 07:39:14	rocx	it's still dumb how you can brick a system based on what's on the hard disk.
2016-03-03 07:39:49	@xero	not as dumb as bricking a phone by setting the year to the unix epoch
2016-03-03 07:40:18	rocx	maybe there's some time warp voodoo going on and the firmware(?) warped to the epoch.

2016-03-03 07:42:03	nightmared	fyr: what do you prefer ? Rebuild the program with debug symbols and use gdb ?
2016-03-03 07:42:14	fyr	eh
2016-03-03 07:42:21	nightmared	Because at least, strace require nothing to work
2016-03-03 07:42:31	fyr	I've never used strace
2016-03-03 07:42:41	fyr	means I have to learn something new
2016-03-03 07:42:45	fyr	I'm lazy okay!
2016-03-03 07:43:45	nightmared	You have nothing to do: just append strace -f before the program name and look at the output
2016-03-03 07:45:07	%kirby	Yeah there's not much to strace

2016-03-03 08:25:08	arc	i used ii with tmux for some time
2016-03-03 08:25:10	halfwit	It just mocks a server iirc
2016-03-03 08:25:13	arc	but it became annoying
2016-03-03 08:25:19	arc	bitlbee *is* a server
2016-03-03 08:25:26	arc	it's a local irc server
2016-03-03 08:25:31	@xero	>not as customizable
2016-03-03 08:25:33	@xero	pllllls
2016-03-03 08:25:33	halfwit	Yeah. 
2016-03-03 08:25:46	halfwit	Nothing is as customizable as rolling your own >.>;
2016-03-03 08:25:49	arc	xero: weechat can be scripted in $language
2016-03-03 08:25:53	arc	irssi can be scripted in perl
2016-03-03 08:26:16	@xero	i dont really think that makes for a larger grade of customization
2016-03-03 08:26:22	@xero	that's more options on HOW to customize
2016-03-03 08:26:30	arc	yes
2016-03-03 08:26:33	@xero	but doesnt intrinsicly add more features
2016-03-03 08:26:35	arc	i phrased it wrong
2016-03-03 08:26:36	arc	brb
2016-03-03 08:26:37	@xero	or customizablility
2016-03-03 08:26:44	halfwit	That's fair
2016-03-03 08:27:07	@xero	irssi just has really shitty docs for how to theme it
2016-03-03 08:27:32	@xero	i had to join their irc and ask the devs last time i made a theme
2016-03-03 08:27:44	@xero	some of the options only work in one context or block
2016-03-03 08:27:48	ubuuu	worth?
2016-03-03 08:27:50	@xero	others are just completely undocumented
2016-03-03 08:28:24	halfwit	Worth?
2016-03-03 08:29:24	halfwit	Wirth > Worth
2016-03-03 08:31:14	halfwit	xero: I know that trying to wrangle irssi settings was one of the main causes for me trying weechat

2016-03-03 08:35:57	@xero	rocx: like using html/css for your notifications and such
2016-03-03 08:36:12	rocx	xero: how HIGH do you HVE to B to do such a THING?
2016-03-03 08:36:15	ubuuu	rocx: it actually works fine
2016-03-03 08:36:35	@xero	rocx: it's dcat, using osx, making webview bars

2016-03-03 08:42:45	greduan	nice
2016-03-03 08:42:48	greduan	it was easy right?
2016-03-03 08:42:51	@z3bra	yeah
2016-03-03 08:42:55	@z3bra	surprisingly
2016-03-03 08:43:01	greduan	OpenBSD is the best experience I've ever had with an OS
2016-03-03 08:43:20	greduan	*only* reason I switched away from it was the fact that it didn't have good support for Node.js
2016-03-03 08:43:37	@z3bra	lel
2016-03-03 08:43:45	greduan	which, as you may know, is my bread and butter
2016-03-03 08:43:57	rocx	okay never mind you only have 5G of it, not enough for z3bra's gaping hard disk.
2016-03-03 08:44:03	rocx	that needs to be filled.
2016-03-03 08:44:14	@z3bra	of what?

2016-03-03 08:44:55	@fro	doesn't*
2016-03-03 08:45:33	greduan	basically nvm needs to be available and working
2016-03-03 08:45:38	greduan	if it isn't, then I can' work on it
2016-03-03 08:45:55	greduan	(node version manager)
2016-03-03 08:46:22	@fro	no idea
2016-03-03 08:46:38	@fro	just know there's a recent version of node LTS
2016-03-03 08:47:47	greduan	right
2016-03-03 08:47:55	greduan	in the packages I assume
2016-03-03 08:48:00	@fro	yep
2016-03-03 08:48:05	greduan	z3bra: 5GB of hentai

2016-03-03 13:26:52	rocx	and it's stupidly simple.
2016-03-03 13:27:06	rocx	no really i have a working prototype of my client.
2016-03-03 13:27:21	rocx	you can even just echo a line to netcat.

2016-03-03 13:30:27	josm	yeah thought so
2016-03-03 13:30:33	rocx	honestly though it's exhausting.
2016-03-03 13:30:34	half	Mine is ok, it took a massive hit when I switched to Dvorak
2016-03-03 13:30:35	rocx	QWERTY.
2016-03-03 13:30:42	rocx	that's why i like workman layout over colemak and dvorak.
2016-03-03 13:30:49	rocx	NOW the others caught up.
2016-03-03 13:30:53	half	I contemplated Workman.
2016-03-03 13:30:59	rocx	the other hosers in that race have 33wpm and 29wpm.
2016-03-03 13:31:06	josm	I don't think I'll ever switch from qwerty
2016-03-03 13:31:18	rocx	i need to make my change final.
2016-03-03 13:31:18	josm	since I can't type "properly" in the first place
2016-03-03 13:31:26	half	I analyzed my heatmaps over code and regular typing, seemed to favor dvorak. 
2016-03-03 13:31:29	rocx	josm: it's hard to type "properly" on QWERTY anyway.
2016-03-03 13:31:42	half	But that was way back in the day when I was mostly doing Java/web
2016-03-03 13:31:49	@fro	heh

2016-03-03 13:32:35	@fro	i'm sure i type faster than that
2016-03-03 13:32:47	rocx	oh.
2016-03-03 13:32:49	josm	I learnt to "type" through spamming RuneScape chat, rocx :V

2016-03-03 13:33:07	rocx	four!
2016-03-03 13:33:08	@fro	but not with correct punctuation
2016-03-03 13:33:08	josm	it's really hard to switch
2016-03-03 13:33:14	@fro	so i guess it doesn't count
2016-03-03 13:33:24	half	I was pretty good, I just didn't enjoy it.
2016-03-03 13:33:34	rocx	never got a subscription.
2016-03-03 13:33:56	josm	You had to type a fuck ton in RS, that's why I'm bringing it up
2016-03-03 13:34:21	half	I remember we had kids living with us after there mom passed, they would play it for hours upon hours, and I ended up giving them everything on my toon
2016-03-03 13:34:29	rocx	toontown?
2016-03-03 13:34:33	half	I think I gave them my toon

2016-03-03 13:37:05	*	rocx files through to see the crap he made.
2016-03-03 13:37:06	josm	yeah sure
2016-03-03 13:37:16	half	Hell, most things have been made already, so gluing things together is a big part of the scheme
2016-03-03 13:37:30	rocx	let's see... a crap attempt at a site, a color theme, a fortunes database, and my configuration.
2016-03-03 13:37:36	rocx	nope, i ain't made jack squart.
2016-03-03 13:37:45	josm	suuuuure
2016-03-03 13:38:00	rocx	half: i love the syntax of clojure, but wish for the power and "ease of use" as common lisp.

2016-03-03 13:42:56	rocx	and i'm using alists to store my info, like frame width, height, font face and size.
2016-03-03 13:43:48	josm	emacs is weird
2016-03-03 13:43:54	rocx	and a lot of bloat.
2016-03-03 13:43:57	rocx	in a way, necessary bloat.
2016-03-03 13:44:04	josm	why do you use it anyway?
2016-03-03 13:44:07	rocx	but it comes with two IRC clients out of the box.

2016-03-03 13:44:31	rocx	instead of a gorillion terminals, i only use emacs for most things.
2016-03-03 13:44:38	josm	it's fine feute
2016-03-03 13:44:43	rocx	and multiple frames.

2016-03-03 13:45:15	rocx	and that terminals now suck.

2016-03-03 13:51:41	feute	boobah: yeah i just noticed it
2016-03-03 13:51:52	feute	it's gohu's fault
2016-03-03 13:52:21	boobah	any reason you're not just using the same font for terminal and bar? they're similar enough that you might as well just use the same one
2016-03-03 13:53:28	feute	i was trying out gohu 
2016-03-03 13:53:37	boobah	okay :)

2016-03-03 14:21:54	boobah	rocx: ah, right
2016-03-03 14:21:55	half	Mhmm
2016-03-03 14:22:02	rocx	it's good if you're hankering for cardboard with pizza sauce.
2016-03-03 14:22:08	boobah	rocx: a dedicated salad joint would be ... interesting
2016-03-03 14:22:20	boobah	rocx: haha, little caesers is very polarizing
2016-03-03 14:22:21	rocx	boobah: they're big if you order online.
2016-03-03 14:22:38	rocx	they say that local joints are always better but they're really nonexistant.
2016-03-03 14:22:50	boobah	depends where you're from, i think
2016-03-03 14:23:08	rocx	all the ones here in ATL are cardboard with pizza sauce.
2016-03-03 14:23:09	boobah	there are some local places where my parents live
2016-03-03 14:23:22	boobah	some decent mom&pop italian places
2016-03-03 14:23:23	rocx	and local places are more hole-in-the-wall.
2016-03-03 14:23:34	rocx	you might have some luck in the piedmont area.
2016-03-03 14:23:38	rocx	the gayest place in the state.
2016-03-03 14:23:40	rocx	literally.
2016-03-03 14:23:51	rocx	not an exaggeration.
2016-03-03 14:24:14	rocx	like i think i saw ymbx there one time when i had to show up for a job interview in a building that you could see piedmont park from.
2016-03-03 14:24:28	boobah	what, really
2016-03-03 14:24:37	boobah	or is he gay or something
2016-03-03 14:24:52	rocx	boobah: he's so far in the closet, he's lost in Narnia.

2016-03-03 14:26:37	boobah	that's dope. i usually just get salad stuff from the grocery store, but an actual salad place would be shweet.
2016-03-03 14:27:14	rocx	okay this is done. the hardest part is writing test cases.

2016-03-03 14:58:52	josm	maybe that's why
2016-03-03 14:59:02	josm	what
2016-03-03 14:59:16	josm	actually it probably is that
2016-03-03 15:00:13	josm	you didn't set the size half?
2016-03-03 15:00:39	josm	yup, that was it

2016-03-03 15:09:25	josm	hmm
2016-03-03 15:09:31	josm	can you exec from bspwmrc?
2016-03-03 15:09:49	feute	yes
2016-03-03 15:09:58	josm	eg. "exec setxkbmap gb"
2016-03-03 15:10:02	josm	hmm okay
2016-03-03 15:10:09	feute	bspwmrc is just a script
2016-03-03 15:10:16	josm	ahhh
2016-03-03 15:10:21	feute	in that case would be "setxkbmap gb"
2016-03-03 15:10:23	feute	without exec

2016-03-03 21:02:08	fyr	morning
2016-03-03 21:08:51	%kirby	Did we ever make a Nixers sticker?
2016-03-03 21:08:58	%kirby	I was planning on getting one.
2016-03-03 21:12:29	fyr	I love the anti-sticker circlejerk in that thread venam 
2016-03-03 21:14:06	@venam	fyr: but they do have way too many stickers
2016-03-03 21:14:18	fyr	meh
2016-03-03 21:14:20	@venam	fyr: a little more and they'll put stickers right on the screen too
2016-03-03 21:14:25	fyr	heh
2016-03-03 21:14:49	%kirby	I have a single Debian one right in the middle
2016-03-03 21:15:07	%kirby	I think most people get them at conventions and stuff
2016-03-03 21:15:27	%kirby	My friend who went to FOSDEM came back with loads of stickers (like the OP of that thread).
2016-03-03 21:16:05	fyr	fair enough

2016-03-03 21:21:18	fyr	Okay, I figured out last night why I lose color accuracy with certain encoders last night
2016-03-03 21:21:45	fyr	it's because they change the default x11grab rgb to yuv444p or something similar like that
2016-03-03 21:22:07	fyr	and I don't know how to force it, I think it depends on the encoder
2016-03-03 21:22:21	fyr	which is really annoying as I have my hardware accel working
2016-03-03 21:22:35	fyr	but using it with rgb streams means I lose color data
2016-03-03 22:07:29	fyr	my record script is getting much smarter finally though
2016-03-03 22:22:07	fyr	looks like there's nothing really out there that implements it well
2016-03-03 22:22:11	fyr	that sucks
2016-03-03 22:22:42	fyr	not even propreitary code could save me
2016-03-03 22:23:25	%kirby	So what you're saying is you found a gap in the market? :P
2016-03-03 22:24:55	fyr	apparently so
2016-03-03 22:25:13	fyr	I am just sad nvidia doesn't have support rgb in their encoder
2016-03-03 22:25:48	fyr	because it's a fuck ton faster than using the x264 on the cpu itself
2016-03-03 22:25:54	fyr	oh well
2016-03-03 22:26:17	fyr	at least I convert movies and tv in that pixel format over with no issues

2016-03-04 01:07:44	%adam	rocx: gettin super close to finishing the wumpus assignment
2016-03-04 01:07:49	@rocx	adam: OOOOOoh
2016-03-04 01:08:16	%adam	you do everything except shoot spiders or wumpuses
2016-03-04 01:08:21	@rocx	i'm just having issues with a variable argument.
2016-03-04 01:08:30	seth	adam, is it played through a terminal?
2016-03-04 01:08:33	seth	I wanna play!
2016-03-04 01:08:34	%adam	yea
2016-03-04 01:08:41	@rocx	adam: what i do is just assign variables `wumpus`, `spider1`, and `spider` as integers.
2016-03-04 01:08:43	seth	I love terminal games
2016-03-04 01:08:47	@rocx	their values would be their room numbers.
2016-03-04 01:08:49	%adam	hah its not complete but if you have java installed you can check it out i guess
2016-03-04 01:08:57	%adam	https://github.com/akess/assignments/wumpus
2016-03-04 01:09:06	seth	PRIVATE
2016-03-04 01:09:06	@rocx	when you move them, you have to roll and make sure that whatever you roll will need to be adjacent to their room.
2016-03-04 01:09:07	seth	gasp
2016-03-04 01:09:08	%vypr	adam: morning mate
2016-03-04 01:09:11	%adam	hey vypr
2016-03-04 01:09:16	@rocx	or you could assign them as Rooms.
2016-03-04 01:09:27	@rocx	because any room with the wumpus is a Wumpus Room.
2016-03-04 01:09:39	seth	adam: that repo is private. le sad
2016-03-04 01:09:40	thang1	ahh the wumpus thing
2016-03-04 01:09:47	%adam	oh wait
2016-03-04 01:09:48	%adam	seth
2016-03-04 01:09:48	%adam	lol
2016-03-04 01:09:51	thang1	I did that in AI :)
2016-03-04 01:09:52	@rocx	Is it a rumpus room? rhombous room? back me up here, guys. i have to make a funny out of this.
2016-03-04 01:09:52	%adam	hold on
2016-03-04 01:09:59	%adam	https://github.com/akess
2016-03-04 01:10:00	thang1	or at least looked it up, didn't program it
2016-03-04 01:10:05	%adam	then just go to assigments/wumpus
2016-03-04 01:10:11	%adam	i forgot the blob/master or whatever in the url
2016-03-04 01:10:16	thang1	the DATING GAMEEEEE
2016-03-04 01:10:19	%vypr	https://github.com/akess/CS248/tree/master/assignments/wumpus
2016-03-04 01:10:23	%vypr	i gotchu fam
2016-03-04 01:10:27	%adam	thnx
2016-03-04 01:10:28	seth	ohh
2016-03-04 01:10:30	seth	got it
2016-03-04 01:10:42	%adam	download the repo and the do a 'java main'
2016-03-04 01:10:44	%adam	to launch it
2016-03-04 01:10:49	thang1	man fuck you, I wanted java tinder, not some stupid "AI" thingey
2016-03-04 01:10:58	%adam	haha
2016-03-04 01:11:13	%adam	rocx: im just doing a random number from 11-16
2016-03-04 01:11:17	%adam	er whatever it is
2016-03-04 01:11:21	%adam	and then just adding onto the room array
2016-03-04 01:11:22	%adam	cause fit
2016-03-04 01:11:25	%adam	sorry
2016-03-04 01:11:26	%adam	f it
2016-03-04 01:11:51	thang1	where's the random number thingey?
2016-03-04 01:12:04	seth	I died by default. I blindly fired into rooms 2, 6 and 10
2016-03-04 01:12:34	thang1	the fuck
2016-03-04 01:12:42	%adam	thang1: you can use Math.random() to generate a random number
2016-03-04 01:12:42	thang1	for (;;) ? You know java has while right?
2016-03-04 01:12:48	%adam	does it matter?
2016-03-04 01:12:52	thang1	adam: I meant where in the file were you doing it :p
2016-03-04 01:13:01	%adam	i havent commited it yet
2016-03-04 01:13:14	thang1	And yeah it does lol. Java is a JVM. Doing things non cannonically is a surefire way to fuck your performance
2016-03-04 01:13:22	@rocx	there we go. perfect.
2016-03-04 01:13:40	%adam	i guess but i doubt my prof is gonna care for a 2nd semeseter programming course
2016-03-04 01:13:45	%adam	maybe later he will
2016-03-04 01:13:52	%adam	but as you can see my code is generally shit
2016-03-04 01:13:57	seth	golang removed the distinction, "while" is just for {}
2016-03-04 01:13:57	thang1	yeah I noticed
2016-03-04 01:14:22	thang1	but golang still has the keyword "while" right?
2016-03-04 01:14:52	seth	no
2016-03-04 01:15:11	thang1	oh okay, cool
2016-03-04 01:15:27	thang1	that's a sane way to do it. If you have both "while" and "for", you should be using while where while is intended imo
2016-03-04 01:16:16	%kirby	I'm doing golang for my group project
2016-03-04 01:16:21	%kirby	Having never touched it before
2016-03-04 01:16:22	thang1	I'm taking java next quarter. woo /slits_wrists
2016-03-04 01:16:23	%kirby	It's ok
2016-03-04 01:16:36	seth	kirby: I like it
2016-03-04 01:16:44	muggahtee	adam: i broke your wumpus game
2016-03-04 01:16:52	seth	the cross platform feature is a big selling point
2016-03-04 01:16:53	%adam	that should be pretty easy
2016-03-04 01:17:01	%adam	i dont check input at all
2016-03-04 01:17:13	seth	adam: it looks like the rooms are hard coded?
2016-03-04 01:17:16	muggahtee	I didn't try to break it :(
2016-03-04 01:17:17	%adam	they are
2016-03-04 01:17:20	%kirby	My main argument against it is due to it's relative infancy.
2016-03-04 01:17:37	%kirby	Like if I need a librafy for anything slightly non-trival I end up looking at some kiddie's GitHub.
2016-03-04 01:17:51	thang1	hah that's how haskell feels
2016-03-04 01:18:11	seth	kirby: really? there are some really solid libs out there
2016-03-04 01:18:21	thang1	"oh hey here's a cool library" (last updated in 2013, only ever uploaded, one single commit, with the message "will probably rewrite completely sometime later lol")
2016-03-04 01:18:21	%kirby	We found one eventually and it's super solid
2016-03-04 01:18:24	muggahtee	adam: https://paste.teknik.io/Simple/4G0JC
2016-03-04 01:18:32	%kirby	Also coincidentally implements the exact algorithm we need haha
2016-03-04 01:18:33	seth	but what I do like is the code is so easy to read, I usually just PR the fix in
2016-03-04 01:18:43	seth	when I find a problem with a lib
2016-03-04 01:18:58	%adam	muggahtee: oh that actually shouldnt happen....
2016-03-04 01:19:05	%adam	thanks for lettin me know ill have to check that out
2016-03-04 01:19:07	%kirby	I hate the semicolon thing as well but whatever.
2016-03-04 01:19:17	thang1	heheh zero based index logic fucked you up, I'm guessing?
2016-03-04 01:19:20	seth	kirby: as in no semi colons?
2016-03-04 01:19:26	%kirby	Yeah
2016-03-04 01:19:41	thang1	I like it, actually
2016-03-04 01:20:05	seth	semicolons are an unnecessary thing. Newline character is solid 99% of the time
2016-03-04 01:20:17	%kirby	Meh, difference in opinion.
2016-03-04 01:20:26	thang1	exactly. Just look at javascript, it uses either/or (which is fucking retarded)
2016-03-04 01:20:26	%kirby	Every other language I use uses them.
2016-03-04 01:20:39	thang1	but it pretty much completely demonstrates you don't need semicolons :p
2016-03-04 01:20:41	%kirby	Oh yeah that's dumb if you're going to do one stick with it.
2016-03-04 01:20:48	fyr	semicolons are great
2016-03-04 01:20:51	fyr	stfu
2016-03-04 01:21:20	@rocx	heh. now THIS is my kind of workflow.
2016-03-04 01:21:21	thang1	What are they even for, anyway? Designating the end of a statement, right?
2016-03-04 01:21:21	seth	in JS you should probably use semicolons
2016-03-04 01:21:35	seth	the preprocessor inserts them for you, but sometimes unexpected things happen
2016-03-04 01:21:37	%kirby	Yeah thang1.
2016-03-04 01:21:46	thang1	so now you have newline, semicolon, carriage return all doing the same exact thing
2016-03-04 01:21:51	thang1	and all three are required .__.
2016-03-04 01:22:00	@rocx	 https://p.iotek.org/c82.png
2016-03-04 01:22:20	thang1	fuckkit man just make linux line endings standard and get rid of the semicolon. Newline is good enough for everything :p
2016-03-04 01:22:33	%adam	rocx: thats pretty nice tbh
2016-03-04 01:22:37	%adam	what are you using for a bar?
2016-03-04 01:22:39	thang1	ooh pretty
2016-03-04 01:22:39	seth	kirby: you can use semi colons in golang... they're just not often used
2016-03-04 01:22:44	@rocx	adam: that's xclock.
2016-03-04 01:22:50	%adam	hah nice
2016-03-04 01:22:55	seth	https://play.golang.org/p/NNOQ3PW2xp
2016-03-04 01:23:01	thang1	wait golang has optional semicolons?
2016-03-04 01:23:02	%kirby	lol
2016-03-04 01:23:07	seth	yeah, apparently
2016-03-04 01:23:08	%kirby	Bit late now though
2016-03-04 01:23:17	thang1	FUCK, WHY
2016-03-04 01:23:18	%kirby	And I should probably stick to how it's meant to be done
2016-03-04 01:23:25	%kirby	No point making it something it's not
2016-03-04 01:23:36	thang1	why would they do that kinda shit when JS already proved it's retarded?
2016-03-04 01:23:44	seth	thang1: in langs that omit the semicolon, one is usually inserted by the preprocessor prior to comilation
2016-03-04 01:23:52	seth	compilation*
2016-03-04 01:24:54	seth	in the case of golang, if you have an if statement that's 200 characters wide, you might want to break it up into a few lines
2016-03-04 01:25:04	seth	if you're a part of the 79 char-width masterrace
2016-03-04 01:25:07	thang1	Why would it be 200 characters wide anyway?
2016-03-04 01:25:13	thang1	it's not java lol
2016-03-04 01:25:30	seth	contrived example, but it's possible a lib has ridiculous constant names or something
2016-03-04 01:25:43	thang1	yeah... idk
2016-03-04 01:25:51	thang1	I know semicolons make compilers way easier to work with
2016-03-04 01:26:25	thang1	but it just feels unnecessary to me. If a compiler can work with relative indentation, newlines, and overall scope all at once, why would you need semicolons to determine statement parsing?
2016-03-04 01:27:20	@rocx	freaking piss!
2016-03-04 01:27:48	thang1	Honestly though, one of the biggest things I like about golang
2016-03-04 01:27:50	thang1	is gofmt
2016-03-04 01:28:09	thang1	fucking genius
2016-03-04 01:28:48	thang1	standardize everyone in the world to use a formatter for their code and then bam, nobody argues about fucking 4 line indents or whatnot, or where to put your braces and parens

2016-03-04 06:22:40	@rocx	SMW was alright, DK is harder than a boogerbutt, super metroid is about as boring as the game boy one, link to the past is overrated, MK is impossible on level 1, ff6 is eh, secret of mana's a doozer, EWJ1+2 is fun, and paperboy is why the fsck would you want to torture yourself like that the NES port was bad enough you hoser.
2016-03-04 06:22:56	@rocx	CT's also overrated and EB's definite fun.
2016-03-04 06:23:11	@rocx	i'm just not a big fan of JRPGs unless it's a good JRPG.

2016-03-04 06:25:36	@xero	and that split screen multi player
2016-03-04 06:25:54	@rocx	impossible to get all the emeralds alone, impossible to get them all with the genesis controlling tails.

2016-03-04 06:27:01	@xero	gred: i was gonna say
2016-03-04 06:27:12	half	There were many good games back then. 
2016-03-04 06:27:20	@xero	obitus is the worst rpg ever made
2016-03-04 06:27:28	half	It was all gameplay back then though, since there was no fookin' graphics race.
2016-03-04 06:27:29	@xero	that bebe's kids game
2016-03-04 06:27:36	gred	you just couldn't get away with graphics and the games were expensive so the games had to be well made and content filled for people to buy it
2016-03-04 06:27:37	@rocx	if ya'll liked secret of mana, play tales of phantasia.
2016-03-04 06:27:51	@rocx	never got far in star ocean, but that also really floored me.

2016-03-04 06:28:40	gred	I know I played at least 30 hours of walkthrough-guided gameplay (as a kid) and I still didn't finish it

2016-03-04 06:28:44	gred	now imagine without a walkthrough

2016-03-04 06:29:59	@rocx	gah i meant tales. don't know if it had a european release, busy working on english to find out right now, and and all i remember playing it by was a translation.
2016-03-04 06:30:08	@rocx	a good translation, i might say. no glitches.
2016-03-04 06:30:33	@xero	like i was saying. im trying to beat all the physical carts i have

2016-03-04 06:34:38	gred	^^
2016-03-04 06:34:59	gred	for me it's cause I can't cheat at all, no save states and shit, so when I beat it it feels really legit
2016-03-04 06:35:05	@rocx	playing via emulator via wii via homebrew channel is still not as great as a real deal, but it's pretty freaking close.

2016-03-04 07:00:12	@rocx	It only seemed to hit the side of the wheel, but it bounced right off and twitched in the road.
2016-03-04 07:00:23	half	we hit a grouse in the summer
2016-03-04 07:00:40	half	So it was twitching on the roadside, we go to the gf's brothers hous

2016-03-04 07:08:12	half	Though, how can you listen to Wiz Khalifa, and have an opinion about religion?
2016-03-04 07:08:22	@rocx	he listens to country too.
2016-03-04 07:08:27	@rocx	rap and country are his primary genres.

2016-03-04 18:21:02	@z3bra	half, thanks
2016-03-04 18:21:12	half	No problem.
2016-03-04 18:23:09	half	I'm so tempted to throw fucking neovim away and wrap something simpler. 
2016-03-04 18:24:03	@z3bra	why?
2016-03-04 18:24:39	half	Well, things such as - running an arbitrary command on a selection, without any form of feedback in the buffers 
2016-03-04 18:24:55	half	You can't exactly do it, it'll block while it waits for that command to return
2016-03-04 18:26:17	@z3bra	what's the use case here?
2016-03-04 18:26:39	half	My plumber, 
2016-03-04 18:27:13	half	Just the way i prefer to interact with things is a quick visual selection, then press a keybind
2016-03-04 18:27:34	half	So I'd select say a function that I wnt a manual for, press p, and the manual would pop up
2016-03-04 18:28:03	half	(Or website manual if I don't have a local copy) 
2016-03-04 18:28:17	half	Anyways. It's a lot of work to get some of the other crap in Neovim I really like >.>;
2016-03-04 18:29:23	half	All in all though, this is a microoptimization in the scheme of things
2016-03-04 18:31:28	half	It's pretty neat so far. ~ https://ptpb.pw/5SLt.mkv

2016-03-05 01:18:46	fyr	it being generating an index.html for each ports repo to show the hidden files
2016-03-05 01:19:18	fyr	works okay, but I dunno how to align the elements
2016-03-05 01:20:10	fyr	example: http://pub.iotek.org/p/hwmFqlS.png
2016-03-05 01:21:00	sbrg	fyr: float: right, maybe?
2016-03-05 01:21:13	sbrg	IANACG
2016-03-05 01:21:47	fyr	IAMACG?
2016-03-05 01:23:11	fyr	also it's all part of the same element
2016-03-05 01:23:20	sbrg	i am not a css guru
2016-03-05 01:23:37	fyr	yeah it's juse using <pre><code> and that's it
2016-03-05 01:23:47	sbrg	aaah
2016-03-05 01:23:58	sbrg	well, put the text in a <span> or something and float it right
2016-03-05 01:24:25	sbrg	give a class or do smoething like #idforyourpreblock > span: .. etc
2016-03-05 01:24:29	sbrg	or however the syntax is
2016-03-05 01:24:43	fyr	aaah
2016-03-05 01:24:47	fyr	yeah that might work

2016-03-05 01:30:24	fyr	:)
2016-03-05 01:30:43	sbrg	hm, maybe you want a <div> with two spans where the first floats left and the second floats right. but the div container might have to be fixed width
2016-03-05 01:31:03	fyr	yeah I think two spans is right
2016-03-05 01:31:57	fyr	min-width should solve it

2016-03-05 01:39:26	fyr	bet z3bra would know heh
2016-03-05 01:40:21	tudurom	a fifo-based mail client should be a good idea
2016-03-05 01:41:27	tudurom	or just a directory-based email client. You have a directory for your imbox, sent mails and outgoing mails. You write a text file in the outgoing directory. When it's sent it's moved automagically to the sent mails dir.

2016-03-05 03:55:08	+seth	what's wrong with git :P
2016-03-05 03:55:21	@rocx	seth: http://magit.vc/
2016-03-05 03:55:33	@rocx	it's a git interface.
2016-03-05 03:55:33	@xero	>emacs
2016-03-05 03:55:46	+seth	>git >interface
2016-03-05 03:55:47	sshbio	rocx: You are not the first that I have seen that ask himself this question.
2016-03-05 03:55:52	half	For gits
2016-03-05 03:56:03	+seth	When I see people using visual git
2016-03-05 03:56:14	+seth	they forget or do not usually know how to do common git operations
2016-03-05 03:56:19	+seth	and become completely reliant on it
2016-03-05 03:56:32	@xero	rocx: this kinda looks like gitv
2016-03-05 03:56:37	@xero	the vim plugin i was talking about http://vimawesome.com/plugin/gitv
2016-03-05 03:56:43	@rocx	seth: funny that it's not like visual git. you still need to know the operations to perform.
2016-03-05 03:57:47	@rocx	command-line wise, i never got the hang of using git there that much anyway besides the adding, committing, pushing, and rebasing.
2016-03-05 03:58:18	half	Pro-Git is a pretty decent book
2016-03-05 03:58:48	@rocx	the thing is more on what tasks to all do. in the long run, i wanted to see a diff of what i changed on a stylesheet.
2016-03-05 03:59:08	@xero	vimdiff
2016-03-05 03:59:09	@xero	;D
2016-03-05 03:59:16	@rocx	with magit, as simple as `d s`.
2016-03-05 03:59:21	@xero	i use
2016-03-05 03:59:24	half	That's handy
2016-03-05 03:59:24	@xero	g d
2016-03-05 03:59:29	@rocx	it really is handy.
2016-03-05 03:59:57	@xero	rocx: isnt ediff built in though?
2016-03-05 04:00:09	sshbio	xero: It is
2016-03-05 04:00:14	@xero	you dont need anything more than to set it as your git diff tool
2016-03-05 04:00:15	@rocx	but that's for local files.
2016-03-05 04:00:32	@xero	you're using git remotly?
2016-03-05 04:00:46	@rocx	meant that ediff was on two files on your hard disk.
2016-03-05 04:01:00	@xero	idgi
2016-03-05 04:01:09	@rocx	it's basically a version of the `diff` command.
2016-03-05 04:01:11	@rocx	not `git diff`.
2016-03-05 04:01:29	@xero	im saying you can use ediff for your git diff
2016-03-05 04:01:35	@rocx	oh.
2016-03-05 04:01:43	@xero	how i use vimdiff for my git diff
2016-03-05 04:01:47	@xero	no plugins required
2016-03-05 04:02:09	@xero	https://github.com/xero/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.gitconfig#L16
2016-03-05 04:02:16	@rocx	huh.
2016-03-05 04:02:19	@xero	you can also use it as your merge tool
2016-03-05 04:02:31	@xero	just also set [merge]
2016-03-05 04:02:48	@xero	notice my d alias as well?
2016-03-05 04:02:58	@xero	g d = git difftool
2016-03-05 04:03:05	@rocx	ah.
2016-03-05 04:05:17	sshbio	vim as diff/merge tool [✓]
2016-03-05 04:05:39	sshbio	vim as irc client [✓]
2016-03-05 04:05:51	sshbio	If I continue I will have vim as emacs [✓]
2016-03-05 04:06:04	@xero	it can happen
2016-03-05 04:07:08	%stark	then call it and move onto nvim ...
2016-03-05 04:07:15	sshbio	now that neovim has terminal support, I could set abduco as attach-detach tool for vim, and use it as a multiplexer.
2016-03-05 04:07:59	sshbio	stark: Yes!  But no, I am back to irssi.
2016-03-05 04:08:46	@rocx	WHOA
2016-03-05 04:08:50	%vypr	be sure to use esperanto as your primary language as well
2016-03-05 04:08:58	@rocx	when committing, it even hard-wraps your commit message.

2016-03-05 07:39:20	sshbio	But it does not works well, since html is pertty bad formatted sometimes.
2016-03-05 07:39:29	@z3bra	it is yeah
2016-03-05 07:39:41	@z3bra	you should roll your own html parser

2016-03-05 07:45:09	+fyr	yh
2016-03-05 07:45:29	sshbio	So I will let it a try as well. :)
2016-03-05 07:45:49	@xero	toilet can use figlet fonts, but not the other way around
2016-03-05 07:45:55	@xero	i personally make toilet fonts as well

2016-03-05 10:26:42	@rocx	now why isn't this working?
2016-03-05 10:32:26	@rocx	so jekyll's not finding the post's title.
2016-03-05 10:32:30	@rocx	...and it's in the frontmatter.
2016-03-05 10:37:19	+fyr	haha jekyll
2016-03-05 10:37:53	@rocx	site's hosted on github pages so i'm trying to take advantge of that.
2016-03-05 10:38:05	+fyr	ah
2016-03-05 10:38:15	+fyr	yh that's the only time it's allowed
2016-03-05 10:38:25	@rocx	and my post template's not recognizing that a post title.
2016-03-05 10:48:24	+fyr	sux
2016-03-05 10:49:10	@rocx	i mean, `hello.md` has a "title" part between the ---s for the frontmatter, the `post.htm` template has a {{ post.title }} part...
2016-03-05 10:55:51	sshbio	I ended using a solution like https://github.com/Ypnose/wswsh, because jekyll was an overkill for me.
2016-03-05 10:59:29	sshbio	rocx: make sure the hello.md also has a `layout: post` part, as it does not assign it automatically AFAIR
2016-03-05 10:59:42	@rocx	sshbio: it does.
2016-03-05 11:00:10	@rocx	the rest of the post generates.
2016-03-05 11:00:16	@rocx	it's just that it's not getting the title.
2016-03-05 11:00:19	@rocx	for some dumb reason.
2016-03-05 11:01:08	+fyr	10/10 would jekyll again

2016-03-05 12:25:17	sshbio	The only issue I had with a script like this one was relative links, but no hard to solve neither.
2016-03-05 12:26:00	+fyr	what do you mean?
2016-03-05 12:26:24	half	I don't really care much for links
2016-03-05 12:28:14	sshbio	fyr: On your blog post, the second line of html() has hardcoded relative path, and this would not work out of the box for more or less deep files in the directory structure, like ../../../ or ./
2016-03-05 12:28:57	sshbio	Like for tree-like directory structure.  But these are rare in a blog!

2016-03-05 12:30:52	@rocx	functions for reusable bits or heck, what i would have done was a simple cat job.

2016-03-05 12:31:28	@rocx	and look, this is a time you get to use `cat` properly!
2016-03-05 12:31:37	+fyr	heh
2016-03-05 12:31:46	+fyr	yeah that would work
2016-03-05 12:31:52	half	I had one script, out of everything I've written where I used cat
2016-03-05 12:31:56	sshbio	fyr: estuneo
2016-03-05 12:32:25	@rocx	i had to remind z3bra that this is a good job for `cat` instead of appending redirections.

2016-03-05 12:32:53	+fyr	yeah rocx, you're probably right
2016-03-05 12:33:11	+fyr	I just use nginx to put the header and footer tho
2016-03-05 12:33:18	+fyr	cause I'm lazy
2016-03-05 12:33:36	@rocx	good behavior allows for laziness.
2016-03-05 12:33:42	@rocx	but don't be lazy in the wrong place.
2016-03-05 12:33:53	+fyr	uh huh
2016-03-05 12:33:58	sshbio	Oh! so cat can append snippets before and after a file like so!
2016-03-05 12:34:46	half	cat is short for concatenate, which means to join together 2 or more things in sequence, roughly.
2016-03-05 12:35:03	@rocx	sshbio: the '-' argument is telling `cat` to use standard input there.
2016-03-05 12:35:19	half	Oh I can read the blog now

2016-03-05 14:04:43	@rocx	you know what there needs to be?

2016-03-05 14:05:05	@rocx	the world would be a much better place.
2016-03-05 14:05:23	@rocx	arc: because it was written by a guy who had a history of having common lisp and java work together.
2016-03-05 14:05:36	@rocx	and then he was all "eh, screw it", and made a lisp for the JVM.
2016-03-05 14:05:56	@rocx	two birds, one stone.
2016-03-05 14:06:17	sshbio	Chicken, maybe?  Lisp that 'compiles' to C.
2016-03-05 14:06:23	@rocx	that's scheme.
2016-03-05 14:06:43	@rocx	clojure's a different style of lisp.

2016-03-05 14:26:58	@rocx	same goes to the concept of stacking blocks on top of each other in a triangular shape.
2016-03-05 14:27:07	@rocx	you think us humans could've conceived such an idea? pah!
2016-03-05 14:27:11	%stark	I think if you said you said hate java in a interview over here then they'd never hire you ;_;
2016-03-05 14:27:22	@rocx	well of course they'd never hire you.
2016-03-05 14:27:29	@rocx	they rely on java.
2016-03-05 14:27:50	@rocx	and making their code so interface and design pattern riddled that they'll hire maintainers for the maintainers.
2016-03-05 14:28:16	@rocx	even tried my hand at "more serious" java and thought i'd mod minecraft with forge.

2016-03-05 14:29:08	half	"Then it'll be much less work"
2016-03-05 14:29:31	@rocx	mind you forge was also a hackjob because it (if i recall) injected code into the minecraft client.
2016-03-05 14:29:37	half	It's worse than yodawg, as you have functionally no clue where your errors are truly coming from.
2016-03-05 14:29:46	@rocx	since there was no modding api at the time.

2016-03-05 14:32:25	@rocx	let it all out.
2016-03-05 14:32:32	half	I really like to understand the whole stack I guess.
2016-03-05 14:32:40	@rocx	you never can.
2016-03-05 14:32:41	@rocx	no one has.
2016-03-05 14:32:44	@rocx	no one will.
2016-03-05 14:32:58	half	I'm ok with obfuscating at the point of compiler ~
2016-03-05 14:33:09	half	I'd prefer to know a touch of the implementation there, though.

2016-03-05 14:42:15	half	Oh ok. 
2016-03-05 14:42:34	half	I really don't like these long election cycles with advanced polling.
2016-03-05 14:42:52	@rocx	how would you feel if compulsory voting was a thing wherever you live?
2016-03-05 14:42:56	@rocx	canuckistan?
2016-03-05 14:43:05	half	Everyone who isn't an absolute moron realises that there's herd mentality when it's like this
2016-03-05 14:43:11	half	I'd be alright with it, 
2016-03-05 14:43:19	half	We claim to have a representitive government
2016-03-05 14:43:42	@rocx	i think it'll drop the quality of the votes.
2016-03-05 14:43:50	@rocx	not like the quality was anything decent to begin with.
2016-03-05 14:43:53	half	rocx: But there's so much lead up, so many figures - "58% for Clinton" - people are going to go follow the herd. 
2016-03-05 14:44:01	@rocx	that does suck indeed.
2016-03-05 14:44:02	half	Heh, yeah.
2016-03-05 14:44:18	half	 People that go out currently either care a lot, or have ulterior motive
2016-03-05 14:44:29	@rocx	i think my brother would've voted for sanders. don't know if he managed to vote or not since i'm sureh he's keeping it secret from my parents.
2016-03-05 14:45:02	@rocx	so in common vernacular, "i voted and i should have the right to complain that hillary will win."
2016-03-05 14:45:13	half	Heh.
2016-03-05 14:45:23	@rocx	wait 'til you see the wagers
2016-03-05 14:46:07	half	This is much more like the Oscars of politics than anything meritocratic
2016-03-05 14:46:17	half	But that's not new :p
2016-03-05 14:46:37	@rocx	the debates were described "like WWE" around here.
2016-03-05 14:46:40	half	Just sad to see it so absolutely painfully obvious, in the /age of ubiquitous information/
2016-03-05 14:46:54	@rocx	how do we know such information isn't fabricated nowadays?
2016-03-05 14:47:09	half	Heh. We don't^Wwatch Fox.
2016-03-05 14:47:27	@rocx	we got local FOX but that's about it.
2016-03-05 14:47:30	half	That's a fairly terrible network. 
2016-03-05 14:47:35	@rocx	they tend to focus on the local things.
2016-03-05 14:47:47	@rocx	and not do much in the national scale.
2016-03-05 14:47:49	half	that's good then
2016-03-05 14:48:31	@rocx	at least our's.
2016-03-05 14:48:31	@rocx	the main "FOXNEWS" thing yeah that sucks.
2016-03-05 14:49:06	half	I don't mind when local coverage gets the impetus anyways.  There's no community anymore, it's seemed to have eroded a sense of purpose and unity that once existed
2016-03-05 14:49:21	half	So we have little sects, as opposed to townships :p
2016-03-05 14:49:37	half	And then we're not allowed sects, so we get Blue Bawls.
2016-03-05 14:49:45	half	(I can stretch this further, but eh)
2016-03-05 14:51:22	half	I probably just haven't lived long enough in a city with a population > 1M

2016-03-05 15:16:44	rocx	frankly, down here in the south, you'll probably find that white is a minority. definitely doesn't make my parents happy.
2016-03-05 15:16:45	half	People here got into the oil business at its' height, asuming that it would last forever, when they were informed otherwise. They all bought very expensive cars, houses, toys, et cetera. 
2016-03-05 15:16:53	rocx	laoul.
2016-03-05 15:17:08	rocx	in that case, what would you do with a million dollars?
2016-03-05 15:17:11	rocx	me? nothing.

2016-03-05 15:19:16	rocx	at my old job, that movie was conveniently on the shared network.
2016-03-05 15:19:25	rocx	so anyone in support just had to access it and boom.
2016-03-05 15:19:29	half	...for reference!
2016-03-05 15:19:37	half	I could set the building on fire.
2016-03-05 15:19:39	rocx	it's a step above sneakernet and a step below flat out internet piracy.
2016-03-05 15:19:48	rocx	LAN piracy!
2016-03-05 15:20:02	rocx	and in a workplace to boot!
2016-03-05 15:20:05	half	I don't see how that's any different than multicasting a media drive in your home :p
2016-03-05 15:20:19	rocx	everyone in the building could get a hold of it.
2016-03-05 15:20:20	rocx	heh.
2016-03-05 15:21:20	half	Media piracy isn't hurting fucking anything.
2016-03-05 15:21:40	rocx	i'd at least like to think that.

2016-03-05 23:45:42	arc	well in this case
2016-03-05 23:45:51	arc	I have "externalnyc" (in this case ixvpn) set up
2016-03-05 23:46:16	@z3bra	then configure your computer to connect to it :)
2016-03-05 23:46:32	arc	so I don't need internalnyc/ams1 in the tutorial
2016-03-05 23:46:33	arc	aight
2016-03-05 23:47:07	@z3bra	https://p.iotek.org/z8b
2016-03-05 23:47:10	@z3bra	^ the Pkgfile
2016-03-05 23:47:15	arc	thanx
2016-03-05 23:48:29	arc	server-side was easy enough then
2016-03-05 23:48:34	@z3bra	yeah
2016-03-05 23:48:42	@z3bra	that's the case for most things

2016-03-05 23:48:57	@z3bra	clioent side is the same
2016-03-05 23:48:58	arc	hi
2016-03-05 23:49:07	arc	well in that case this should be very easy z3bra 
2016-03-05 23:49:09	arc	:)
2016-03-05 23:49:09	@z3bra	except you need to setup a "hosts" to connect to
2016-03-05 23:49:13	@z3bra	yup
2016-03-05 23:49:27	arc	ohhh
2016-03-05 23:49:41	arc	so i set up my computer like i would internalnyc
2016-03-05 23:49:46	@z3bra	yep
2016-03-05 23:49:58	arc	that's easy
2016-03-05 23:50:11	@z3bra	who said it would be hard?
2016-03-05 23:50:32	arc	me
2016-03-05 23:50:34	arc	internally
2016-03-05 23:50:41	arc	everything is hard until i actually do it
2016-03-05 23:51:54	%vypr	hello
2016-03-05 23:51:56	arc	hi
2016-03-05 23:51:58	@z3bra	oi
2016-03-05 23:53:18	@z3bra	aaaaah
2016-03-05 23:53:25	@z3bra	I failed with the Pkgfile :P
2016-03-05 23:53:27	@z3bra	hold on
2016-03-05 23:54:17	arc	i installed it
2016-03-05 23:54:24	arc	wondered why it wanted to use /usr/etc though
2016-03-05 23:54:28	arc	--config flag
2016-03-05 23:54:29	@z3bra	yeah haha
2016-03-05 23:54:40	arc	`--config=/etc/tinc/ixlappy`
2016-03-05 23:54:55	@z3bra	https://p.iotek.org/x6d
2016-03-05 23:55:09	@z3bra	better like this
2016-03-05 23:55:55	@z3bra	it feels weird to we though..
2016-03-05 23:56:02	@z3bra	(the setup, not the Pkgile)
2016-03-05 23:56:20	@z3bra	it looks more like site-to-site VPN than server/client
2016-03-05 23:57:24	dcat	>$name-vpn
2016-03-05 23:57:31	dcat	not
2016-03-05 23:57:40	dcat	>$name-$version.tar.gz
2016-03-05 23:58:14	@z3bra	I named the port "tinc"
2016-03-05 23:58:19	@z3bra	not "tinc-vpn"
2016-03-05 23:59:29	dcat	>source=(http://www.$name-vpn.org/packages/tinc-$version.tar.gz)
2016-03-05 23:59:42	@z3bra	well, ok it's really fucked up haha
2016-03-05 23:59:47	dcat	lol
2016-03-05 23:59:59	@z3bra	but works :P
2016-03-06 00:00:02	dcat	yeah
2016-03-06 00:00:20	@z3bra	fixed thanks
2016-03-06 00:01:57	ubuuu	dcat: how do i connect the style.css with the bar?
2016-03-06 00:02:41	dcat	it loads it from the directory you run it from
2016-03-06 00:02:57	dcat	you can just read the source though
2016-03-06 00:04:27	@z3bra	arc, you need to config your computer as if it was asm1
2016-03-06 00:04:36	@z3bra	(just looked at the scheme sorry ^^')
2016-03-06 00:04:49	ubuuu	it's not working
2016-03-06 00:05:22	arc	i probably fucked up somewhere
2016-03-06 00:05:23	dcat	ubuuu: that's the worst feedback you can ever give
2016-03-06 00:05:30	arc	"Could not open /dev/net/tun: No such file or directory"
2016-03-06 00:05:46	arc	and running
2016-03-06 00:05:58	arc	"ifconfig: SIOCSIFNETMASK: No such device"
2016-03-06 00:06:06	ubuuu	dcat: I'm sorry 
2016-03-06 00:06:13	dcat	specify what's not happening
2016-03-06 00:06:20	dcat	and what you did
2016-03-06 00:06:32	ubuuu	vim style.css
2016-03-06 00:07:05	ubuuu	http://pastebin.com/Ya3NZex3
2016-03-06 00:07:56	dcat	that's html
2016-03-06 00:07:58	dcat	not css
2016-03-06 00:08:28	dcat	all you need is what's in the <style> section
2016-03-06 00:08:30	dcat	so
2016-03-06 00:08:34	dcat	echo 'p.solid {border-style: solid;}' >style.css
2016-03-06 00:08:43	ubuuu	aah ok
2016-03-06 00:09:09	dcat	but what you probably want is
2016-03-06 00:09:27	dcat	echo 'html {border: 1px solid white;}' >style.css
2016-03-06 00:09:49	dcat	and probably set the 'max-height' variable to whatever height your bar is
2016-03-06 00:10:18	ubuuu	ok thanks
2016-03-06 00:11:02	dcat	but the source code is seriously like 50 lines of code
2016-03-06 00:11:12	dcat	you can read it and understand everything that goes on in it
2016-03-06 00:11:22	dcat	even without understanding C or obj-c
2016-03-06 00:11:42	ubuuu	okay
2016-03-06 00:14:38	arc	aha
2016-03-06 00:15:28	arc	i need to compile my kernel again
2016-03-06 00:15:29	arc	woo
2016-03-06 00:15:43	dcat	arc: you probably have hardware that supports it
2016-03-06 00:15:57	arc	supports what
2016-03-06 00:16:05	dcat	compiling your own kernel
2016-03-06 00:16:10	arc	yes i do
2016-03-06 00:16:32	arc	i'm confused dcat 
2016-03-06 00:16:50	dcat	on my hardware, it takes >12h to compile linux
2016-03-06 00:16:55	dcat	with minimal modules
2016-03-06 00:17:01	arc	yes
2016-03-06 00:17:08	arc	i've compiled linux many times before
2016-03-06 00:17:11	arc	lel
2016-03-06 00:17:14	dcat	yeah
2016-03-06 00:17:20	arc	takes ~20min on my laptop
2016-03-06 00:17:21	dcat	my point is that you at least have the option
2016-03-06 00:17:27	dcat	exactly
2016-03-06 00:17:38	arc	dcat: sucks
2016-03-06 00:17:48	dcat	ubuuu: https://p.iotek.org/p33.c
2016-03-06 00:17:52	dcat	case 's':
2016-03-06 00:18:05	dcat	you can specify the stylesheet with that
2016-03-06 00:18:29	ubuuu	mmm
2016-03-06 00:18:56	@z3bra	what's that?
2016-03-06 00:19:08	arc	aight i gotta recompile my kernel on the client side
2016-03-06 00:19:09	dcat	z3bra: my osx version of dzen2/bar
2016-03-06 00:19:16	arc	using webkit apparently
2016-03-06 00:19:17	arc	or something
2016-03-06 00:19:22	arc	right dcat 
2016-03-06 00:19:22	dcat	yes
2016-03-06 00:19:23	@z3bra	oh, okay
2016-03-06 00:19:33	@z3bra	arc, why do you need to recompile the kernel?
2016-03-06 00:19:37	arc	tun
2016-03-06 00:19:46	@z3bra	let me ask again
2016-03-06 00:19:51	@z3bra	why do you need to recompile the kernel?
2016-03-06 00:19:55	dcat	you don't have tun interface support built into kernel?
2016-03-06 00:20:04	arc	apparently not
2016-03-06 00:20:07	@z3bra	dcat, linux don't by default
2016-03-06 00:20:15	dcat	what
2016-03-06 00:20:22	@z3bra	not a big deal
2016-03-06 00:20:27	@z3bra	it depends on kernel config
2016-03-06 00:20:42	@z3bra	arc, just compile the module
2016-03-06 00:20:53	arc	k
2016-03-06 00:21:01	arc	although
2016-03-06 00:21:10	@z3bra	that's the whole point of modules :P
2016-03-06 00:21:12	arc	my kernel's also out of date at the same time so
2016-03-06 00:21:13	arc	WHY NOT
2016-03-06 00:21:13	dcat	doesn't it use the same driver as lo0?
2016-03-06 00:21:19	@z3bra	nope
2016-03-06 00:21:41	%kirby	I've never had to compile a kernel :o
2016-03-06 00:22:12	arc	kirby: i'm on crux
2016-03-06 00:22:18	%kirby	Well rip you then
2016-03-06 00:22:23	dcat	interesting
2016-03-06 00:22:27	arc	which doesn't put kernels in the hands of package management
2016-03-06 00:22:29	dcat	is crux turning into gentoo?
2016-03-06 00:22:38	@z3bra	no?
2016-03-06 00:22:41	arc	crux puts more of an emphasis on packaging
2016-03-06 00:22:53	@z3bra	dcat, it's just source-based
2016-03-06 00:22:56	dcat	yes
2016-03-06 00:23:01	dcat	but I mean in the elitist sense
2016-03-06 00:23:05	@z3bra	ah
2016-03-06 00:23:11	%kirby	It wasn't already?
2016-03-06 00:23:20	arc	it pisses me off when you have the 4chan edgelords installing crux for cool points
2016-03-06 00:23:31	@z3bra	I did it for cool points.
2016-03-06 00:23:40	@z3bra	you too
2016-03-06 00:23:44	@z3bra	kori too
2016-03-06 00:23:53	@z3bra	everyone on unixporn/#rice too
2016-03-06 00:23:54	arc	i did it because i heard it was good with package management
2016-03-06 00:23:58	@z3bra	lel
2016-03-06 00:24:02	dcat	wow
2016-03-06 00:24:03	@z3bra	its pakcage management sucks
2016-03-06 00:24:38	arc	z3bra: i was on #rice once and considering the current state of that channel every time i brought up any issue with anything they said 'well stop using crux then'
2016-03-06 00:24:41	arc	lel'd
2016-03-06 00:25:03	arc	literally they were having a discussion about pulseaudio and whether it was good/bad
2016-03-06 00:25:09	arc	i joined and said how it didn't work right for me
2016-03-06 00:25:21	arc	and they said 'well maybe it's because you're on a meme distro'
2016-03-06 00:25:40	ubuuu	dcat: im gonna play around with it later. The bar disspears when i type in words but when im just hitting enter the bar is there... weird
2016-03-06 00:26:02	@z3bra	full of tards
2016-03-06 00:26:04	dcat	it reads line by line
2016-03-06 00:26:11	@z3bra	anyhow

2016-03-06 00:50:25	dcat	setting it's state to down?
2016-03-06 00:50:27	@z3bra	when I run ifconfig
2016-03-06 00:50:34	@z3bra	I see both tun0 and tun1 for example
2016-03-06 00:50:41	@z3bra	I don't want to use tun1 anymore
2016-03-06 00:51:12	@z3bra	setting it down isn't enough it seemse
2016-03-06 00:51:14	@z3bra	seems
2016-03-06 00:51:31	dcat	it should be gone once you set it as down

2016-03-06 00:52:04	@z3bra	but no idea how to do that
2016-03-06 00:52:13	dcat	do you have tunctl?
2016-03-06 00:52:21	@z3bra	nope
2016-03-06 00:52:28	dcat	how did you create it?
2016-03-06 00:53:05	dcat	oh right
2016-03-06 00:53:09	dcat	linux uses `ip` now
2016-03-06 00:53:15	dcat	ip link delete tun1
2016-03-06 00:53:33	@z3bra	yeah I know how to do it under linux :P
2016-03-06 00:53:38	dcat	`ip` is such shit
2016-03-06 00:53:42	@z3bra	I like it
2016-03-06 00:53:51	@z3bra	preferences I guess
2016-03-06 00:54:07	dcat	it's like shitting on unix philosophy
2016-03-06 00:54:18	dcat	OHHH
2016-03-06 00:54:24	dcat	are you talking about your openbsd server?
2016-03-06 00:54:33	dcat	ifconfig tun1 destroy
2016-03-06 00:54:59	@z3bra	just found it in the manpage ;)

2016-03-06 00:55:47	@z3bra	I've been messing with tun interfaces on my serv

2016-03-06 00:56:52	@z3bra	yeah I knew this command though
2016-03-06 00:57:56	@z3bra	I'm surprised by openbsd though
2016-03-06 00:58:06	@z3bra	it's cooler than expected :P
2016-03-06 00:59:58	@z3bra	ok, got the vpn back up
2016-03-06 01:00:05	@z3bra	I messed up the tun0 interface
2016-03-06 01:00:08	@z3bra	not sure how
2016-03-06 01:00:52	@z3bra	so okay, now tinc.

2016-03-06 01:27:22	@z3bra	arc, did you have to do something special to get it working?
2016-03-06 01:27:28	arc	no
2016-03-06 01:27:49	arc	followed the tutorial word-for-word
2016-03-06 01:28:14	@z3bra	that's odd
2016-03-06 01:28:29	arc	aside from the i-don't-have-three-servers thing
2016-03-06 01:28:34	@z3bra	does tincd writes something special to stderr when the tunnel is established?
2016-03-06 01:28:41	arc	no idea
2016-03-06 01:28:52	arc	i followed the tutorial
2016-03-06 01:28:53	@z3bra	when you run tincd -D -d3
2016-03-06 01:29:06	arc	ran tincd -D -d3 on both client and server
2016-03-06 01:29:06	@rocx	arc: what did you get working?
2016-03-06 01:29:12	arc	rocx: vpn
2016-03-06 01:29:15	@z3bra	tinc vpn
2016-03-06 01:29:18	arc	then i ping'd

2016-03-06 01:29:32	@z3bra	od
2016-03-06 01:29:39	arc	so it works for me

2016-03-06 01:40:06	arc	you run a different distro on your server than your computer
2016-03-06 01:40:18	arc	and then you can't get used to handling two different package managers
2016-03-06 01:40:28	arc	like if i ssh into my server first thing i try to run prt-get
2016-03-06 01:40:35	arc	but when i go back to my laptop i try to run apk
2016-03-06 01:44:43	ubuuu	somebody using dzen2?

2016-03-06 02:35:09	arc	doeesn't really matter tbh
2016-03-06 02:35:28	+fyr	there was some discussion about adding it to autoindex and a patch but I don't think it got accepted
2016-03-06 02:36:20	boobah	would it be so hard to just modify the source?
2016-03-06 02:36:29	boobah	it can't be that bad
2016-03-06 02:37:07	+fyr	meh
2016-03-06 02:37:17	+fyr	autoindex is pretty limited
2016-03-06 02:37:17	boobah	i really like your script though :)
2016-03-06 02:37:25	+fyr	and I don't want the bloat of fancy index
2016-03-06 02:42:09	+fyr	find really is a pain to work with whitespace though
2016-03-06 02:45:20	boobah	what, filenames with spaces in them?
2016-03-06 02:45:35	boobah	whattdyu mean
2016-03-06 02:48:30	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-06 02:48:45	+fyr	find would split them out all wrong and fuck the script up
2016-03-06 02:53:58	dcat	fyr: link to the script again?
2016-03-06 02:54:12	boobah	fyr: curly braces and double-quotes are your friend

2016-03-06 02:58:08	boobah	lol
2016-03-06 02:58:38	arc	fyr: why do you use "printf '%s\n'" and not "echo"
2016-03-06 02:58:40	dcat	where is it deployed?
2016-03-06 02:58:42	arc	out of curiosity
2016-03-06 02:58:48	+fyr	arc, because fuck echo
2016-03-06 02:58:52	dcat	lel
2016-03-06 02:58:55	+fyr	dcat, wildefyr.net/media
2016-03-06 02:58:56	dcat	my guess
2016-03-06 02:59:04	dcat	is that it used to be a format
2016-03-06 02:59:07	boobah	why not just printf '</code></pre>\n' 
2016-03-06 02:59:08	dcat	but the formatting was removed
2016-03-06 02:59:27	+fyr	boobah, because if you do that printf accepts format args in the string you're printing
2016-03-06 02:59:28	dcat	it's all over my code
2016-03-06 02:59:49	boobah	fyr: but that is a fixed string which contains no formatting symbols
2016-03-06 03:00:03	+fyr	boobah, sure, but it's good practice to not do it in the first placec
2016-03-06 03:00:05	dcat	when you simplify your code
2016-03-06 03:00:10	dcat	you end up with a lot of shit like that
2016-03-06 03:01:11	dcat	printf '%d%s%d\n' $SOME_INT $SOME_STRING $SOME_OTHER_INT
2016-03-06 03:01:26	boobah	i mean, that's fine
2016-03-06 03:01:31	dcat	printf "5%s%d" $SOME_STRING $SOME_INT
2016-03-06 03:01:50	dcat	printf '5blah5\n'
2016-03-06 03:01:59	dcat	and you forget to change it to echo
2016-03-06 03:02:39	dcat	fyr: your page looks pretty good, but my browser window is tiny
2016-03-06 03:02:47	dcat	so the table is waaaaaay off

2016-03-06 03:04:13	+fyr	dcat, yeah it's probably not scaling properly :/
2016-03-06 03:04:25	dcat	brotip: use percentages
2016-03-06 03:04:26	boobah	fyr: your homepage has a typo in the printf command at the bottom :)
2016-03-06 03:04:49	+fyr	gah
2016-03-06 03:07:17	dcat	fyr: tip: use echo when applicable, replace the whole `find` line with ls with -1 flag, and don't use wtfpl
2016-03-06 03:07:40	dcat	and; awesome work
2016-03-06 03:08:00	+fyr	words of encouragement
2016-03-06 03:08:03	+fyr	I can dig it
2016-03-06 03:08:09	dcat	and,
2016-03-06 03:08:17	dcat	appreciate how rare it is, coming from me
2016-03-06 03:08:31	+fyr	that's what's so surprising
2016-03-06 03:11:37	dcat	also, this is a matter of preference, but when doing multiple lines, I often use `cat` and HEREDOC
2016-03-06 03:11:56	+fyr	yeah I was thinking of replacing that block with cat
2016-03-06 03:12:05	+fyr	HEREDOC? not familiar with that

2016-03-06 04:31:11	boobah	haven't done this in forever
2016-03-06 04:32:57	Roonix	speaking of the nixer certificate of approval; what app menu you guys using?
2016-03-06 04:32:58	@z3bra	I use wpa_supplicant
2016-03-06 04:33:07	%vypr	boobah: its actually IP over Carrier Pigeon
2016-03-06 04:33:09	@z3bra	there is an approval of apps now?
2016-03-06 04:33:27	boobah	z3bra: just meant the general consensus :P
2016-03-06 04:33:36	boobah	z3bra: wpa_supplicant is fine, i'll use that
2016-03-06 04:33:42	boobah	vypr: lol
2016-03-06 04:33:55	@z3bra	I like the fact everything is set in a single file

2016-03-06 04:34:04	boobah	yeah, it's simple and works (usually)
2016-03-06 04:34:20	boobah	except my university wireless will be a pain set up
2016-03-06 04:34:51	boobah	i had it working with wicd on my old laptop, but wicd was kinda meh
2016-03-06 04:36:58	+fyr	boobah, connman is approved by me :D
2016-03-06 04:37:08	+fyr	Roonix, dmenu obviously
2016-03-06 04:37:31	boobah	Roonix: you want a keyboard or mouse driven menu?
2016-03-06 04:39:52	Roonix	mouse
2016-03-06 04:40:03	boobah	check out 9menu or thingmenu
2016-03-06 04:40:18	boobah	or dzen if you want fancier stuff

2016-03-06 04:49:02	Roonix	hmm think i'll go back to thingmenu then, which is what I was using on my old setup
2016-03-06 04:49:46	boobah	my only complaint with it is all those messy border lines. do you know if you can easily get rid of those?
2016-03-06 04:50:02	boobah	z3bra might also know
2016-03-06 04:50:30	@z3bra	know what ?
2016-03-06 04:50:45	boobah	if you can remove the border lines in thingmenu
2016-03-06 04:50:52	@z3bra	ah yeah
2016-03-06 04:51:10	half	Thingmenu is neat :3
2016-03-06 04:51:21	@z3bra	I have a path for the borders
2016-03-06 04:51:28	@z3bra	patch

2016-03-06 04:51:55	boobah	thanks!
2016-03-06 04:52:17	half	Woah, hold up. Too crazy of a pathc.
2016-03-06 04:52:25	half	patch *
2016-03-06 04:52:26	boobah	nice, just make the lines the same color as the background :)
2016-03-06 04:53:43	@z3bra	yeah
2016-03-06 04:53:51	@z3bra	simplest is best
2016-03-06 04:54:17	arc	Roonix: app launcher: dmenu, link opener: thingmenu
2016-03-06 04:55:17	+fyr	heh don't listen to these guys: https://github.com/Wildefyr/bin/blob/master/load
2016-03-06 04:55:19	half	arc: I'm using it for any context
2016-03-06 04:55:45	arc	fyr: i use thingmenu for my link opener if and only if the link isn't handled
2016-03-06 04:55:55	arc	to select something to open it with
2016-03-06 04:56:05	+fyr	I just open it in chrome
2016-03-06 04:56:06	half	I use it to select a site for manuals, for instance
2016-03-06 04:56:18	+fyr	cba to select something with thingmenu
2016-03-06 04:56:29	arc	<down><down><enter>
2016-03-06 04:56:30	arc	was that so hard
2016-03-06 04:56:42	+fyr	yes
2016-03-06 04:56:56	+fyr	I'd rather just be focused on the content immediately
2016-03-06 04:57:08	half	Lol
2016-03-06 04:57:54	arc	kek
2016-03-06 04:58:06	half	It's ok. People are allowed to be noobs.
2016-03-06 04:58:31	half	Like me, I forgot to write down my ffmpeg string, and now my lappy is on the fritz.
2016-03-06 04:58:37	half	That's where my damn shell history for it is ;-;
2016-03-06 04:58:54	boobah	RIP
2016-03-06 04:59:31	+fyr	half, what do you mean? :D
2016-03-06 04:59:42	boobah	his ffmpeg screen recording command, presumably
2016-03-06 04:59:50	half	Yeah
2016-03-06 04:59:57	half	It's in my logs anyways \o/
2016-03-06 05:00:33	+fyr	ah I was gonna write a blog post of ffmpeg
2016-03-06 05:00:46	+fyr	found out a lot more recently about screen grabbing
2016-03-06 05:01:03	half	You can use slop iirc for some thing out there
2016-03-06 05:01:18	+fyr	no
2016-03-06 05:01:26	+fyr	even I've stopped using slop
2016-03-06 05:01:29	+fyr	don't use it
2016-03-06 05:01:39	boobah	is that the thing from the maim guy
2016-03-06 05:01:42	+fyr	ye
2016-03-06 05:02:05	half	I used to use it fairly often, eh. No point now.
2016-03-06 05:02:42	boobah	what do you do for arbitrary selections?
2016-03-06 05:03:04	half	In the off chance I want to do one, well, slop :p
2016-03-06 05:03:09	half	I just haven't in months
2016-03-06 05:03:11	+fyr	boobah, wmutils lol
2016-03-06 05:03:20	boobah	i usually just get the whole screen or a whole window and then crop it manually
2016-03-06 05:03:33	+fyr	https://github.com/Wildefyr/bin/blob/master/shot
2016-03-06 05:03:46	+fyr	https://github.com/Wildefyr/bin/blob/master/record too
2016-03-06 05:04:14	boobah	similar to what i do, except i don't have a script
2016-03-06 05:04:28	boobah	so just `xscreenshot $(pfw)` or similar
2016-03-06 05:04:32	+fyr	yh
2016-03-06 05:04:57	boobah	i still use an traditional window manager, but wmutils is really nice for stuff like that
2016-03-06 05:05:21	boobah	plus of course defining weird tiling layouts that would otherwise be difficult to set up
2016-03-06 05:06:17	+fyr	I gotta get around to writing a binary partitioning tile script ...
2016-03-06 05:06:43	boobah	sounds kind of tough tbh
2016-03-06 05:06:47	+fyr	not really
2016-03-06 05:06:54	+fyr	I got a good idea of how to go around it now
2016-03-06 05:06:58	boobah	did you ever talk to baskerville?
2016-03-06 05:07:04	+fyr	nah I probably need to know
2016-03-06 05:07:14	+fyr	though*
2016-03-06 05:07:18	boobah	haha
2016-03-06 05:07:49	half	ddg is actingi weird
2016-03-06 05:07:54	+fyr	??
2016-03-06 05:07:58	half	-i
2016-03-06 05:08:46	half	...and now it works.
2016-03-06 05:08:59	half	"Wait for him to complain!"
2016-03-06 05:09:03	half	-NSA
2016-03-06 05:11:13	half	https://ptpb.pw/iQNc.mkv so far, but I'd like to have it center the menu in the focused screen
2016-03-06 05:12:21	+fyr	hmm
2016-03-06 05:12:29	half	Should be pretty easy.
2016-03-06 05:12:42	half	wattr xywh | awk 
2016-03-06 05:12:47	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-06 05:13:25	half	Because awk is love. 
2016-03-06 05:13:33	boobah	i need to learn awk
2016-03-06 05:13:40	boobah	i only know sed stuff
2016-03-06 05:14:03	half	Does awk have int casting?
2016-03-06 05:14:04	+fyr	I use awk sometimes when cut sucks or I need specific output with printf
2016-03-06 05:14:15	+fyr	otherwise I don't have a need for it
2016-03-06 05:14:51	half	wattr xywh $(pfw) | awk '{ print $1 + $3 / 2, $2 + $4 / 2 }'
2016-03-06 05:15:17	half	Then just each side less 1/2w and 1/2 heigh of thingmenu
2016-03-06 05:15:26	half	So simple, it should be illegal.
2016-03-06 05:16:04	boobah	very nice
2016-03-06 05:16:07	boobah	that's sweet
2016-03-06 05:16:20	boobah	i've been using variable assignment and bash maths
2016-03-06 05:16:59	half	Awk is good. It's from our Savior, Kernighan. (Go was clearly his senior moments)
2016-03-06 05:18:05	boobah	was it written anything like the way he wrote troff?
2016-03-06 05:18:18	half	No clue.
2016-03-06 05:18:32	boobah	although, i assume GNU awk is a complete rewrite
2016-03-06 05:24:25	arc	boobah: it is

2016-03-06 06:50:57	boobah	now i need to worry about syncing my configuration files and source code
2016-03-06 06:51:15	boobah	i should really centralize this stuff
2016-03-06 06:52:01	half	boobah: I've been using syncthing for my notes, history, and video URLs
2016-03-06 06:52:13	half	But man is it handy
2016-03-06 06:54:30	tudurom	i'm using my own script which saves notes in a git repo

2016-03-06 06:54:58	boobah	half: thanks, i'll check it out
2016-03-06 06:55:06	boobah	tudurom: the problem is that git servers are usually kind of slow
2016-03-06 06:55:17	tudurom	i don't care
2016-03-06 06:55:22	tudurom	it's descentralized
2016-03-06 06:55:26	tudurom	it's all i want
2016-03-06 06:55:37	boobah	i guess i could run a git server locally
2016-03-06 06:55:39	arc	so I realized that the VPN actually didn't work
2016-03-06 06:55:45	arc	there's something very fucked that I don't understand
2016-03-06 06:56:06	tudurom	boobah: you can run a local git server and a private gitlab repo in case your local one fails
2016-03-06 06:56:45	half	I mean, I use git for configs and programming
2016-03-06 06:57:04	boobah	i manage a gitlab server that's a few blocks away from my house
2016-03-06 06:57:07	boobah	hmmm
2016-03-06 06:57:18	half	But syncthing is transparent, backgrounded
2016-03-06 06:57:26	tudurom	with git you have revisions
2016-03-06 06:57:31	boobah	half: my src/ directory is like half a gig or more
2016-03-06 06:57:33	half	Yeah, only 10 here
2016-03-06 06:57:40	half	Erm, you can set it but
2016-03-06 06:57:52	boobah	10 what?
2016-03-06 06:57:53	half	It's not meant for bigger things I don't think
2016-03-06 06:57:58	half	10 revisions
2016-03-06 06:58:05	boobah	oh
2016-03-06 06:58:20	tudurom	should i use syncthing for syncing my music collection with my phone?

2016-03-07 03:32:15	+fyr	mpv plays media
2016-03-07 03:32:18	arc	do one thing and do it well
2016-03-07 03:32:23	arc	mpv is not designed to play music

2016-03-07 04:08:43	@rocx	it was terrible how it lacked a headphone jack and required some proprietary headphones instead.

2016-03-07 04:14:36	@rocx	the regular was the best shape but required AA-cell batteries and lacked a backlight.
2016-03-07 04:14:41	@rocx	the SP had the problems i mentioned above.
2016-03-07 04:15:00	@rocx	and the micro's just way too small to functionally use. start/select issues too.

2016-03-07 07:07:22	tudurom	it creates event 16
2016-03-07 07:07:29	tudurom	and i use it to handle window creation
2016-03-07 07:07:49	+fyr	use wattr o $wid then
2016-03-07 07:07:58	+fyr	that's why I am not having this issue
2016-03-07 07:08:15	tudurom	well i use it

2016-03-07 13:37:54	@fro	what does the script do?
2016-03-07 13:39:11	sshbio	It is not 100% vim based this time: http://i.imgur.com/kcWHDyC.png
2016-03-07 13:41:23	sshbio	It is really simple: It connects to preffered servers and starts vim, if it does not have argument, it opens tail -f to some server if it does (like 'irc.iotek.org/#nixers')
2016-03-07 13:42:22	sshbio	The output is formatted and coloured with sed, as I barely know awk or C for now.
2016-03-07 13:46:02	sshbio	Only 100 lines :) https://github.com/sshbio/dot/raw/master/bin/irc
2016-03-07 13:49:04	sshbio	I guess you use irssi and weechat.  By the way, I read K&R a bit, it is really a good book.  Thank you!
2016-03-07 13:49:25	half	sshbio: Very good book!
2016-03-07 13:59:57	feute	is the -p option of `read` portable? it doesn't work on my system

2016-03-07 16:05:00	@venam	I have the algorithm on paper
2016-03-07 16:05:06	@venam	not so complex

2016-03-07 16:06:44	%adam	next up gotta format the mac
2016-03-07 16:06:52	%adam	then backup the vps and downgrade
2016-03-07 16:07:19	%stark	adam, Have you multi-booted openbsd ?
2016-03-07 16:07:35	%adam	i have not and i probably wont
2016-03-07 16:07:55	boobah	adam: post a screen dump with the new monitor
2016-03-07 16:07:58	%adam	i gotta stay on a linux distro for the forseeable future
2016-03-07 16:08:00	%stark	I could never figure it out how
2016-03-07 16:08:17	%adam	boobah: i havent compiled a way to share a screenshot yet :)
2016-03-07 16:08:20	%adam	brand new crux install
2016-03-07 16:08:28	boobah	oh, okay :)
2016-03-07 16:08:34	boobah	stark: does openbsd have its own bootloader?
2016-03-07 16:08:37	%adam	yea
2016-03-07 16:08:40	%adam	EFI supported too
2016-03-07 16:08:42	%stark	Yep
2016-03-07 16:09:19	%adam	sadly openbsd's radeon drive doesnt play too nicely with my monitor
2016-03-07 16:09:19	%stark	that fdisk and disklabel is evil
2016-03-07 16:09:36	boobah	planning to replace linux on my computer next weekend
2016-03-07 16:09:38	%stark	always took the whole disk !
2016-03-07 16:09:44	boobah	kinda scared something won't work though
2016-03-07 16:09:50	half	Hmm, Crux must have decent build tools
2016-03-07 16:10:09	%adam	not too bad
2016-03-07 16:10:19	%stark	I want to keep lunix you fish !
2016-03-07 16:11:04	boobah	i should probably try it in a vm or something first
2016-03-07 16:11:13	boobah	i kinda depend on my desktop working
2016-03-07 16:11:15	%stark	I would atleast try out crux if I had the hardware for it
2016-03-07 16:11:16	%adam	boobah: bsd?
2016-03-07 16:11:20	boobah	yeah, openbsd
2016-03-07 16:11:38	%adam	i found openbsd easier to install and configure than any linux distro like, ever
2016-03-07 16:11:55	boobah	just worried some software won't work
2016-03-07 16:12:00	%adam	Xorg works outta the box, base has pretty much eveything except a browser
2016-03-07 16:12:42	%adam	as long as you have a relatively new radeon card hardware should be fine
2016-03-07 16:12:43	boobah	pretty much every program i use is compiled from source, so i'm worried something won't build
2016-03-07 16:12:47	@fro	what software are you worried about
2016-03-07 16:12:50	boobah	i use onboard intel graphics
2016-03-07 16:12:55	boobah	fro: umm
2016-03-07 16:13:00	%adam	i wouldnt build from source on obsd
2016-03-07 16:13:04	%adam	id use the binary packages
2016-03-07 16:13:08	boobah	why do you say that
2016-03-07 16:13:21	%adam	much easier and the ports are a pain in the ass imo
2016-03-07 16:13:27	@fro	it's fine to build from source for stuff that's not in packages or ports
2016-03-07 16:13:51	boobah	fro: nothing in particular. but seriously everything i use besides the base utilities are compiled and i intend to keep it this way
2016-03-07 16:14:01	%adam	all ill say is openbsd is not a source based OS
2016-03-07 16:14:02	@fro	well that's dumb
2016-03-07 16:14:09	boobah	fro: explain
2016-03-07 16:14:20	@fro	you should install from packages first if what you want is there
2016-03-07 16:14:25	boobah	adam: yeah. maybe i shouldn't do this.
2016-03-07 16:14:35	boobah	fro: i tend to apply patches and modify source
2016-03-07 16:14:37	%adam	i dont mean to disuade you
2016-03-07 16:14:44	%adam	its just not ideal in that environment
2016-03-07 16:14:48	boobah	adam: nah, it's better than me regretting it later
2016-03-07 16:14:51	half	dissuade, heh. Don't see that word often
2016-03-07 16:14:57	@fro	adam has clearly never used ports btw
2016-03-07 16:15:05	%adam	i did once
2016-03-07 16:15:06	%adam	i hated it
2016-03-07 16:15:22	half	I don't understand ports yet. 
2016-03-07 16:15:36	boobah	fro: i was just hoping to get a non-GNU userland and a simpler kernel.
2016-03-07 16:15:43	@fro	boobah: at least build from ports
2016-03-07 16:15:53	@fro	also there's still some gnu stuff here
2016-03-07 16:16:04	boobah	like what?
2016-03-07 16:16:20	@fro	gcc
2016-03-07 16:16:22	%adam	gcc iirc
2016-03-07 16:16:54	@fro	texinfo i think
2016-03-07 16:16:58	@fro	that might be it
2016-03-07 16:16:59	@fro	in base
2016-03-07 16:17:22	boobah	yeah, that's fine
2016-03-07 16:17:25	boobah	gcc's a necessary evil
2016-03-07 16:17:36	boobah	it's not as bad as other GNU stuff
2016-03-07 16:17:40	boobah	at least on the surface
2016-03-07 16:17:43	@fro	if you're gonna run this as a desktop
2016-03-07 16:17:46	@fro	use -current
2016-03-07 16:17:52	boobah	okay
2016-03-07 16:18:05	@fro	just install and upgrade from snapshots
2016-03-07 16:18:12	@fro	easy++
2016-03-07 16:18:20	boobah	i'm starting to wonder though, should i just stay with linux on this machine
2016-03-07 16:18:30	boobah	i really like alpine but i always have trouble with xorg
2016-03-07 16:18:47	%adam	its whatevs u want dude
2016-03-07 16:18:58	@fro	yeah this is really just a personal thing
2016-03-07 16:19:01	%adam	personally i think openbsd is a really good desktop OS
2016-03-07 16:19:09	%adam	its not like linux in a lot of ways though
2016-03-07 16:19:14	boobah	i'll put it on my old laptop and see what i think
2016-03-07 16:19:28	boobah	going cold turkey on linux is asking for trouble
2016-03-07 16:19:30	%adam	on the surface i guess you couldnt tell though
2016-03-07 16:19:56	@fro	yeah it's the same except that linux is frankenstein
2016-03-07 16:20:05	boobah	haha
2016-03-07 16:20:14	%adam	you know fro
2016-03-07 16:20:22	%adam	frankenstein wasnt the monster but the scientist
2016-03-07 16:20:29	@fro	i know that
2016-03-07 16:20:34	%adam	just sayin
2016-03-07 16:20:41	@fro	but for that reference we're talking about the monster obviously
2016-03-07 16:20:43	@rocx	did the scientist marry his sister or some orphan that his parents adopted?
2016-03-07 16:20:54	@rocx	s/sister/cousin/
2016-03-07 16:21:28	%adam	idk

2016-03-07 16:55:58	%adam	right well itll probably take another 70 hours for everything to compile so
2016-03-07 16:56:01	@venam	it's just one border is taking the full space and the other border is inside
2016-03-07 16:56:02	%adam	ill catch u all later then
2016-03-07 16:56:16	%adam	nighty night
2016-03-07 16:56:20	@venam	so it's one border in the middle of the other
2016-03-07 16:56:22	boobah	seeya adam
2016-03-07 16:56:42	boobah	venam: what's the basic technique for achieving two borders?
2016-03-07 17:14:24	@venam	boobah: colors that fit together
2016-03-07 17:15:18	boobah	heheh. i meant when you made 2bwm
2016-03-07 17:15:34	boobah	isn't there something tricky you have to do
2016-03-07 17:16:33	@venam	boobah: yes, when drawing the border with xcb you mean?
2016-03-07 17:17:13	boobah	yeah
2016-03-07 17:17:37	boobah	i can't really grok the code but i'm curious how it works :)
2016-03-07 17:18:13	@venam	boobah: there's a built-in function to draw borders but you can't use it to draw double borders
2016-03-07 17:18:29	@venam	it just puts a square around the window and it's not flexible
2016-03-07 17:18:39	@venam	so you have to draw from scratch around the window itself
2016-03-07 17:18:52	@venam	every borders, top, down, left, right
2016-03-07 17:19:18	@venam	and there's a trick because you can't draw "before" the window on the left, so you have to rotate around using negative
2016-03-07 17:19:21	@venam	values
2016-03-07 17:19:53	boobah	whoa
2016-03-07 17:20:00	@venam	you are wrapping the borders as if they went from one side and rotate around to the other
2016-03-07 17:20:12	boobah	how'd you figure that out?
2016-03-07 17:20:47	@venam	boobah: no idea
2016-03-07 17:20:49	@venam	testing
2016-03-07 17:21:12	boobah	that's really cool
2016-03-07 17:21:43	@venam	I tried to make round borders but xcb doesn't support well transparency
2016-03-07 17:21:49	boobah	how does x11/xcb work with borders in general? does xcb consider these to be actual borders, or how are you drawing them?
2016-03-07 17:22:25	boobah	do you just get the position of the window and just send raw drawing commands
2016-03-07 17:22:26	@venam	there are no border concept in x11, nor xcb
2016-03-07 17:22:35	@venam	it's just drawing on the screen around the window
2016-03-07 17:22:38	boobah	got it
2016-03-07 17:22:42	@venam	decoration, you can draw whatever you want
2016-03-07 17:22:51	boobah	what's the point of reparenting if you can do this?
2016-03-07 17:23:01	@venam	faster
2016-03-07 17:23:12	@venam	you don't have to reparent
2016-03-07 17:26:17	boobah	hmm
2016-03-07 17:26:51	boobah	i think most window managers follow the non-reparenting method because it's a lot simpler to implement
2016-03-07 17:27:04	boobah	except maybe openbox or similar, idk

2016-03-08 10:12:53	skrzyp	aros is okay
2016-03-08 10:13:04	skrzyp	I've used it on x86 and m68k
2016-03-08 10:13:17	skrzyp	I've also had an MorphOS license
2016-03-08 10:13:18	skrzyp	xero: ^
2016-03-08 10:13:30	skrzyp	(I think OlaHughson still owns his key)
2016-03-08 10:13:57	fsociety	isnt amigaos still being developed
2016-03-08 10:14:02	skrzyp	I also know people who are using MorphOS daily
2016-03-08 10:14:03	fsociety	last thing i heard is someone leaked a ton of code
2016-03-08 10:14:06	skrzyp	fsociety: yes
2016-03-08 10:14:12	skrzyp	4.1 was released last year
2016-03-08 10:14:14	fsociety	who use MorphOS daily and for what purpose?
2016-03-08 10:14:25	skrzyp	leakage was about 3.x series
2016-03-08 10:14:32	skrzyp	fsociety: for daily use on powerpc platforms
2016-03-08 10:14:51	skrzyp	it runs on their only one "modern" computers
2016-03-08 10:14:59	fsociety	hahaha
2016-03-08 10:15:12	skrzyp	actually you can get done with morphOS, I've used it as main OS for couple of months
2016-03-08 10:15:30	fsociety	i love the powerpc as an architecture, shame it isn't so prominent anymore
2016-03-08 10:15:48	skrzyp	but I needed to sell that machine because my glasses got broken
2016-03-08 10:15:53	skrzyp	and they're a bit expensive
2016-03-08 10:16:59	skrzyp	MorphOS license costs 75-111 EUR (depends on platform)
2016-03-08 10:17:17	skrzyp	and you can download free copy, but it will hang after 30 minutes and raise popup about registration
2016-03-08 10:17:42	skrzyp	instead of actual shutdown, it wil slowly raise CPU load above 100%
2016-03-08 10:19:09	skrzyp	MorphOS is basically an awesome OS, but its community and devteam are worst things every 
2016-03-08 10:19:12	skrzyp	r*
2016-03-08 10:19:57	fsociety	who is the community/dev team so shit?
2016-03-08 10:19:59	fsociety	what makes them awful
2016-03-08 10:20:34	fsociety	other than that awful reminder notice on their OS
2016-03-08 10:20:41	skrzyp	you know, those guys owned highly expanded Amigas in 90-00s
2016-03-08 10:21:09	skrzyp	and their experiences can't be faced with modern technology
2016-03-08 10:22:13	fsociety	haha.. oh dear
2016-03-08 10:23:07	skrzyp	but they got crazy about everything new, and due to some things like Linux-on-PowerPC which was forced by dying Phase5 (manufacturer of 060 and PPC accelerators), also some things like addition of dynamically linked libs post-Commodore AmigaOS updates, they're completely against Open Source, Linux and even porting
2016-03-08 10:23:58	skrzyp	don't even try to port something more popular (and open) without solid argumentation, unless they might need that
2016-03-08 10:24:51	fsociety	oookaayyy, so a completely dillusional community then
2016-03-08 10:25:26	skrzyp	but this is also a huge hipocrisy there
2016-03-08 10:25:43	skrzyp	they're using modified L4 kernel, named Quark, as MorphOS kernel
2016-03-08 10:26:15	skrzyp	while all Amiga-compstible stuff (m68k JIT, Ambient, AOS3 API wrapper) is running in ABox
2016-03-08 10:26:47	skrzyp	which is a sort of domU
2016-03-08 10:27:01	skrzyp	and only one "box" publicly available
2016-03-08 10:27:12	skrzyp	they're compiling WHOLE FUCKING OS by GCC 2.95.3
2016-03-08 10:27:33	fsociety	haha compiling everything against an open source compiler
2016-03-08 10:27:38	fsociety	who would have thought ;)
2016-03-08 10:27:46	skrzyp	mind the version
2016-03-08 10:28:08	fsociety	haha 2.95 considering its up to 5.6
2016-03-08 10:28:08	skrzyp	(but GCC 4.something is available in so-called SDK, which provides some unix-like tools)
2016-03-08 10:28:11	skrzyp	no
2016-03-08 10:28:17	skrzyp	2.95.3 is special version
2016-03-08 10:28:27	fsociety	special community narf version
2016-03-08 10:28:39	skrzyp	very widely used on non-x86 platforms even today
2016-03-08 10:28:45	fsociety	for a special community
2016-03-08 10:28:47	skrzyp	still
2016-03-08 10:28:51	fsociety	sorry its just funny
2016-03-08 10:28:54	fsociety	they are "special"
2016-03-08 10:28:55	fsociety	lol
2016-03-08 10:28:57	skrzyp	I know
2016-03-08 10:29:01	skrzyp	but wait, there's more
2016-03-08 10:29:47	skrzyp	there's also something line "libnix" which makes MorphOS very POSIX-compatible (they can get official POSIX certificate, it passes all the test) but if you intentionally used it, they'll eat you
2016-03-08 10:30:03	skrzyp	libnix is basically an openbsd libc, stolen and wrapped
2016-03-08 10:30:42	fsociety	i need to join this community just read the posts
2016-03-08 10:30:51	skrzyp	hmm
2016-03-08 10:31:01	skrzyp	I think you should start to learn Polish then
2016-03-08 10:31:36	skrzyp	almost 3/4 of MorphOS licensed are registered in Poland, but devteam contains devs from other countries too
2016-03-08 10:31:48	fsociety	nooooooo
2016-03-08 10:32:08	fsociety	so amiga is clearly popular in poland then
2016-03-08 10:32:17	skrzyp	but most of community is located at http://ppa.pl or http://morphos.pl
2016-03-08 10:32:24	fsociety	our governments run amiga backend

2016-03-08 15:25:33	fsociety	now i want to setup a gopher server
2016-03-08 15:25:34	fsociety	haha
2016-03-08 15:25:38	@rocx	go on ahead.
2016-03-08 15:27:03	sshbio	ACTION look for gopher cilent right now and add +1 on its z3bra counter
2016-03-08 15:28:52	fsociety	i see the man behind floodgap has a macintosh IIci.. I had one of those.. overclocked it by 3mhz
2016-03-08 15:28:53	fsociety	haha
2016-03-08 15:29:51	fsociety	finally found the server that runs floodgap, we have a few of those systems in our office
2016-03-08 15:32:42	half	fsociety: It's clearly quite niche, but that doesn't mean it's hella fun :p
2016-03-08 15:33:35	fsociety	half: that is what makes it really amusing. going to create a questionable gopher site with questionably l33ched tv shows for my friends to grab. mostly cause they always come over with hard drives and id rather they figure it out this way
2016-03-08 15:33:36	fsociety	haha

2016-03-08 15:41:22	sshbio	Gopher Gopher Gopher! Such stream of chararters! Straight to the hole, never coming back.  I found heaven in a real files stack.
2016-03-08 15:44:13	half	sshbio: In Plan9, they manage to do that with http
2016-03-08 15:44:15	half	iirc
2016-03-08 15:45:19	sshbio	half: so http//something can as well retrieve gopher://something?
2016-03-08 15:45:32	half	sshbio: No, it will lay it out into a nice file system
2016-03-08 15:46:10	half	That's what I want to do. Have a daemon that listens for pages to load into a filesystem, and have the browser just script calls to that daemon
2016-03-08 15:47:31	fsociety	does anyone here use plan9 full time :)
2016-03-08 15:48:52	sshbio	Time after time I understand better why plan9 is so much appreciated by *nixers and how internetz screwed the whole thing. ;_;  But fortunately, there still are some motherfuckingwebsite.com that we can use.
2016-03-08 15:50:07	half	sshbio: There are many, yeah.
2016-03-08 15:51:06	sshbio	fsociety: Maybe some do use projects like 9base.  (cygwin -> windowze   ~   9base -> linux)
2016-03-08 15:51:34	sshbio	http://tools.suckless.org/9base
2016-03-08 15:56:03	fsociety	just read up on it.. i've seen it mentioned here a few times
2016-03-08 15:57:48	fsociety	put your hands up if you use systemd.. teehee
2016-03-08 16:01:58	therue	other than nixers, r/unixporn, arch forums, dot.share.it, and random deviantart sections... are there any other centralize places for linux customization stuff? whether it's forum for discussion or config files?
2016-03-08 16:03:19	sshbio	fsociety: I do use it as I have Arch, but do not really understand why is it beter yet...
2016-03-08 16:03:56	sshbio	If I understand correctly: plan9 by Bells Labs -> AT&T -> Lucent -> Alcatel -> Nokia (a Microsoft Company)
2016-03-08 16:04:04	sshbio	So plan9 by Microsoft ?? T_T
2016-03-08 16:04:49	fsociety	sshbio: you know you can install openrc on arch
2016-03-08 16:04:58	sshbio	therue: I would say dotfiles on GitHub? searches like Xressources
2016-03-08 16:05:22	fsociety	therue: github is a wonderful resource
2016-03-08 16:05:23	sshbio	fsociety: I did just see that, yes!
2016-03-08 16:05:32	fsociety	sshbio: when i was running arch i removed systemd
2016-03-08 16:05:40	therue	:) i'm new to linux, i'll learn github soon ^_^
2016-03-08 16:06:02	sshbio	therue: I was about to say dotfiles on GitHub as well, with searches like Xressources, bashrc...
2016-03-08 16:06:07	fsociety	sshbio: i stopped using systemd due to the fact it would hang at shutdown in one of the older versions.. and it happened on all of my machines, including my work machine
2016-03-08 16:07:24	sshbio	therue: It can be used as a simle website, with a search bar... They made it simple really!  Git is the powerfull tool that require learning.
2016-03-08 16:08:29	sshbio	fsociety: Ugh! The menace of data loss!
2016-03-08 16:10:20	therue	i know :) i want to learn web development too, so there's tons of stuff to learn. i've only just switch to linux a week or two ago. got arch installed and some applications i would use everyday. just getting more familiar with the system at the moment. but i do prefer being in linux now ^_^
2016-03-08 16:10:30	therue	i only boot to my windows when i have to :D
2016-03-08 16:11:20	fsociety	my win partition is purely for gaming
2016-03-08 16:11:22	sshbio	therue: And you are yet at #nixers!  :)
2016-03-08 16:11:41	fsociety	cause unfortunately most unity games are awful optimized for linux
2016-03-08 16:11:43	fsociety	not to mention sli
2016-03-08 16:11:50	therue	when i have an interest in something, i have the tendency to have the best resources ^_^
2016-03-08 16:11:58	sshbio	ACTION 's partition is dead a long time ago.
2016-03-08 16:12:06	therue	*to find rather
2016-03-08 16:13:43	sshbio	#nixers! Listen at therue! Here is the best resource for all things *nix!

2016-03-08 16:14:26	half	Void is nice so far.
2016-03-08 16:14:29	half	Musl, busybox, runit
2016-03-08 16:14:56	half	Would be nice for the grsec and pax hardened kernel from Alpine to be on Void, as well
2016-03-08 16:16:21	sshbio	half: Void! I heard good things about it even in #emacs ;)
2016-03-08 16:18:12	@venam	what's up nixers?

2016-03-08 16:21:26	fsociety	gofish is now compiled on my debian wheezy NAS
2016-03-08 16:21:34	fsociety	now time to set it up when i get home :P
2016-03-08 16:22:36	fsociety	half: I tried void, i got frustrated with it
2016-03-08 16:22:51	fsociety	meanwhile here i am using funtoo
2016-03-08 16:22:53	half	fsociety: What caused your frustrations? I am very very green with it still
2016-03-08 16:23:13	sshbio	What do nixers use to browse gopher?  elinks? lynx?
2016-03-08 16:23:18	fsociety	half: to be honest i don't remember, it was a while but something wasn't working quite right for me. i'll have to try it again
2016-03-08 16:23:24	fsociety	sshbio: cgo
2016-03-08 16:23:27	fsociety	haha
2016-03-08 16:24:04	fsociety	sometimes tmux doesn't refresh the terminal properly. has anyone else come across this issue?
2016-03-08 16:24:26	half	I don't use Tmux anymore :l

2016-03-08 16:30:35	sshbio	fsociety: For mozilla I mean.  Furthermore it is great!  Straight to my ~/src !
2016-03-08 16:31:18	sshbio	fsociety: I have some similar issue with dvtm, but a ^L usually fixes that
2016-03-08 16:32:50	boobah	tools like dtach offer an automated ^L press or SIGWINCH
2016-03-08 16:34:13	boobah	are there any http-over-gopher bridges?
2016-03-08 16:34:36	boobah	like something that will parse the DOM, and send over a gopherized version of the page?
2016-03-08 16:35:18	sshbio	ACTION is also interested in such black magic to have a 800 SLOC web browser with cgo
2016-03-08 16:35:22	fsociety	sshbio: ahh at least i am not alone
2016-03-08 16:36:33	boobah	sshbio: yep, that's the idea

2016-03-08 16:38:37	half	Um
2016-03-08 16:40:51	boobah	half: do you use dvtm now?
2016-03-08 16:41:07	boobah	half: it's gotten WAY too complicated for my tastes
2016-03-08 16:43:18	half	Presently I have no need for terminal multiplexing
2016-03-08 16:43:26	sshbio	boobah: It is no more complicated than dwm, but is not common approach (dynamic) and is a bit shy on customizations...
2016-03-08 16:43:28	half	But I'd hack something with my algorithm in preferenc
2016-03-08 16:45:35	sshbio	half: dtach / abduco can attach and detach sessions across terminals but without terminal multiplexing.  With some script, these could play nice with window managers.
2016-03-08 16:45:38	boobah	sshbio: well he recently added tagging. just seems like a bit too much for a terminal multiplexer.
2016-03-08 16:46:10	boobah	sshbio: of course, but they don't offer scrollback like tmux/screen/dvtm
2016-03-08 16:47:23	sshbio	boobah: tagging? Nice ;)  No scrolling, indeed.  Either the terminal (st can't) or any other tool...
2016-03-08 16:47:57	half	sshbio: I use abduco all teh time, yeah.
2016-03-08 16:48:36	boobah	yeah, i think tagging came with 0.15? Idk, I'm still on 0.11. You mentioned "any other tool" -- what's one that can provide me with a screen/scrollback buffer?
2016-03-08 16:48:46	fsociety	weechat and tmux dont play friendly with scrolling

2016-03-08 16:49:08	boobah	half: abduco is cool but i like dtach's ability to specify the redraw trigger method
2016-03-08 16:49:21	boobah	half: but abduco still wins with its list view
2016-03-08 16:49:41	half	Oh, eh.

2016-03-08 16:49:59	half	abduco won my favor by how it handled resizing :p
2016-03-08 16:50:50	half	Which i no longer care about.
2016-03-08 16:50:51	half	So
2016-03-08 16:50:53	half	Meh.
2016-03-08 16:51:46	boobah	you don't care because you don't use it all anymore?
2016-03-08 16:51:58	boobah	because normally resizing capability is really important
2016-03-08 16:52:04	boobah	especially for tiling wms :)
2016-03-08 16:52:09	half	My windows are a set size
2016-03-08 16:52:12	half	\o/
2016-03-08 16:52:19	sshbio	boobah: I mostly meant less, directing the output while needing to read it, bash's history...  Not really scrolling
2016-03-08 16:52:30	half	less is all I use
2016-03-08 16:52:36	half	Anything important I log by default
2016-03-08 16:53:02	boobah	sshbio: i've been toying with the idea of a detachable shell session that keeps everything you had onscreen
2016-03-08 16:53:10	boobah	sshbio: pretty sure that's no problem with tmux, but i don't wanna use tmux
2016-03-08 16:53:29	boobah	half: that's so lame, though. what if you want to full-screen or something?
2016-03-08 16:53:43	half	F11
2016-03-08 16:54:00	boobah	yeah? and that counts as a resize event, lol
2016-03-08 16:54:06	boobah	see what i'm sayin
2016-03-08 16:54:07	half	Yeah :P
2016-03-08 16:54:19	half	But the thing is, I'll set it back to normal before I switch machines
2016-03-08 16:54:19	sshbio	boobah: As dwm and st needs to be recompiled to update their options, this is really convenient. convenient
2016-03-08 16:54:23	half	So it's a nonissue 
2016-03-08 16:54:34	half	Well, mostly a non-issue
2016-03-08 16:54:38	boobah	half: if it works for you, it works for you. that would drive me nuts though :P
2016-03-08 16:55:02	half	Though, I'm confused as to why fullscreen from contrib of wmutils is causing a mapping event to wew
2016-03-08 16:55:15	boobah	sshbio: sorry, what was that in response to?
2016-03-08 16:55:27	boobah	half: that's not good.
2016-03-08 16:55:40	half	boobah: Basically before, I had to ctrl+\ and reattach to correct sizing issues :p
2016-03-08 16:56:11	half	I think it's chwso or something, not sure though.
2016-03-08 16:56:15	half	Should ask z3bra I guess.
2016-03-08 16:56:30	boobah	half: when i gave up on a full wmutils setup (probably a year or so ago), it was because i couldn't ever get wew to work reliably
2016-03-08 16:57:51	boobah	half: had this issue where it wouldn't catch cursor entry events unless you moved the mouse really slowly.
2016-03-08 16:58:06	half	boobah: Maybe your stuff is too fast :p
2016-03-08 16:58:27	boobah	half: it did that on a number of computers, and we (z3bra and I) were never able to figure it out
2016-03-08 16:58:30	half	I don't use the mouse though for much of anything. 
2016-03-08 16:58:44	half	Yeah, that's a dealbreaker.
2016-03-08 16:58:45	boobah	quite the opposite, though. all my stuff is pretty old
2016-03-08 16:59:00	boobah	just the fact that it was unreliable turned me off of it
2016-03-08 17:01:50	sshbio	boobah: Np: It was to detachable screens > convenients.  my terminal and window manager must restart to apply settings changes (they must be rerompiled),  so close the terminal, and quit X11, then startx again, re-open the terminal, and attach back and I am back without irc, .* interruption.
2016-03-08 17:02:17	half	x11fs seems to work a bit now.
2016-03-08 17:02:44	boobah	sshbio: oh, gotcha. yeah, i agree it'd be really nice.
2016-03-08 17:03:13	boobah	sshbio: i meant to talk to you about your vim/ii setup, but you were offline earlier
2016-03-08 17:03:39	boobah	i had actually seen your post on /r/unixporn a few days ago, neat stuff
2016-03-08 17:03:44	sshbio	boobah: Oh! sure!
2016-03-08 17:03:49	half	It actually handles ENTER/LEAVE pretty well so far
2016-03-08 17:04:05	boobah	i'm curious of the motivation
2016-03-08 17:04:19	boobah	it's really neat though
2016-03-08 17:04:24	boobah	is it just proof of concept?
2016-03-08 17:04:45	half	...
2016-03-08 17:04:48	half	Guys, this works :p
2016-03-08 17:04:50	sshbio	boobah: Thanks!  This was because I like tiny tools, and yes a little bit :)
2016-03-08 17:05:30	half	https://ptpb.pw/nLKW.mkv
2016-03-08 17:05:34	half	Pretty interesting!
2016-03-08 17:05:38	boobah	awesome, well keep it up! i haven't seen anyone using ii in years.
2016-03-08 17:05:58	sshbio	boobah: I use it righte now, but it is not vim-only: https://www.reddit.com/r/suckless/comments/49e2wp/an_attempt_at_a_ii_wrapper_script/
2016-03-08 17:07:24	boobah	right, i suppose it'll work as long as you have something that can just write the current line to a file
2016-03-08 17:07:34	boobah	if i understand correctly
2016-03-08 17:08:37	sshbio	boobah: Yes: tail -f and printf | somefifo is enough :3
2016-03-08 17:08:57	boobah	nice! i ought to give ii another try someday
2016-03-08 17:09:06	boobah	for now i'm just too addicted to a full ncurses client
2016-03-08 17:09:24	boobah	i'd need to put in a ton of work just to match all the capabilities i use

2016-03-08 17:10:58	boobah	you posted that link four minutes ago, lol
2016-03-08 17:11:12	boobah	am i missing something
2016-03-08 17:11:25	sshbio	boobah: D'oh! exact!
2016-03-08 17:11:51	boobah	half: good to see it working. what were your plans?
2016-03-08 17:11:53	sshbio	But well, I do not have a elaborated use of irc yet
2016-03-08 17:11:59	boobah	half: s/were/are/
2016-03-08 17:12:39	boobah	sshbio: i'm only on 20 channels or so but it's enough that it'd be hard to keep track of if it were aggregated
2016-03-08 17:13:11	sshbio	boobah: About ii: Handling all sort of events like NAMES (already done, but not that well...), and managing channels indeed!
2016-03-08 17:13:50	half	boobah: See where it goes. I don't want more than one long running process, so with this it could be wendy, heh.
2016-03-08 17:14:44	half	https://ptpb.pw/RQZh
2016-03-08 17:14:52	sshbio	What I use is dvtm 'minimize' option to keep a list of channels at the bottom of the screen.  It starts one ii process per server.
2016-03-08 17:14:54	half	See? :D
2016-03-08 17:15:44	boobah	sshbio: good thinking. weechat is such a memory hog :)
2016-03-08 17:16:04	boobah	sshbio: it's currently eating 200 MB virtual on my server
2016-03-08 17:16:04	half	Heh. Border! 
2016-03-08 17:16:08	half	Color seems broken though.
2016-03-08 17:16:41	half	Hmm. Read error on a few parts still, must not be finished.
2016-03-08 17:16:45	boobah	that IS really cool
2016-03-08 17:17:11	sshbio	boobah: oh well!  I use a 100 lines for ii, but there are more evolved clients for it: http://tools.suckless.org/ii/usage
2016-03-08 17:20:52	boobah	yeah, i can definitely see the appeal of that stuff
2016-03-08 17:21:22	boobah	i might move back to it someday
2016-03-08 17:21:44	boobah	i just need enough time to set everything up properly and write scripts/frontends
2016-03-08 17:22:27	sshbio	Habits are so hard to change!
2016-03-08 17:22:58	boobah	agreed.
2016-03-08 17:23:20	half	boobah: The time sink is worth it I guess.
2016-03-08 17:23:29	boobah	sometimes the ends don't justify the means.
2016-03-08 17:24:18	boobah	like sometimes features actually aren't a bad thing
2016-03-08 17:24:22	boobah	i've been down this whole road
2016-03-08 17:26:11	half	They are definitely wonderful
2016-03-08 17:26:19	half	Especially for finding your perfect usage
2016-03-08 17:26:55	boobah	It was only a few months ago that I was in a hyper-minimalism mindset, but I've realized that a proper balance is much more important
2016-03-08 17:27:06	boobah	and the balance makes me the most efficient
2016-03-08 17:27:08	half	boobah: I have much, much time right now :p
2016-03-08 17:27:29	boobah	i wish i could say the same. i'm an engineering student :P
2016-03-08 17:27:52	half	Yeah
2016-03-08 17:28:05	half	I'm a stay at home dad, I've done the 80~ hour thing for a long time though
2016-03-08 17:28:15	half	Not really my thing heh
2016-03-08 17:28:29	boobah	heh, yeah
2016-03-08 17:29:02	boobah	congratulations on being a dad though. i'm looking forward to that time in my life.
2016-03-08 17:29:10	boobah	but i'll enjoy being young for a while :)
2016-03-08 17:29:13	half	It's wonderful, thanks.
2016-03-08 17:29:15	half	Yeah. 
2016-03-08 17:29:50	half	(It can be hellish too. the second he came out, i suddenly hadn't done enough to fix this horribly broken world, it was a huge crushing weight)
2016-03-08 17:29:55	fsociety	i live vicarously through my sisters kids.  i dont think i could be a father just yet even though im 35
2016-03-08 17:30:21	boobah	are you married?
2016-03-08 17:30:23	fsociety	vicariously live*,v
2016-03-08 17:30:28	half	Naw. 
2016-03-08 17:30:32	fsociety	argh.. internet making ssh laggy
2016-03-08 17:30:53	boobah	what about you fsociety? married?
2016-03-08 17:30:53	fsociety	umm. no.. but been in a relationship for eight years
2016-03-08 17:31:02	boobah	dang
2016-03-08 17:31:08	boobah	going okay?
2016-03-08 17:31:13	half	fsociety: almost 7 years here
2016-03-08 17:31:59	fsociety	yeah.. we let each other do what we want hobbies wise :)
2016-03-08 17:32:38	half	That's the thing, too. Build up the other, it takes a bit out of you but 
2016-03-08 17:32:46	half	Otherwise it's a waste of fucing time
2016-03-08 17:32:48	half	fucking *
2016-03-08 17:33:12	fsociety	yeah, letting each other really becoming passionate about whatever interests we have and not go "noo you can't do that" has helped greatly
2016-03-08 17:33:30	boobah	that sounds nice
2016-03-08 17:33:57	fsociety	so she never complains when i buy ridiculous amount of computer stuff. hahaha
2016-03-08 17:34:30	fsociety	she is quite academic, so she took an interest in linux.  she even wanted to go to linuxconf purely on an academic level
2016-03-08 17:34:39	fsociety	shes a teacher, so it didn't surprise me
2016-03-08 17:37:58	boobah	wow

2016-03-08 17:41:40	tudurom	ooh wee!
2016-03-08 17:42:06	half	Shit
2016-03-08 17:42:07	half	It works.

2016-03-08 17:45:21	tudurom	i am THE wizard!
2016-03-08 17:45:29	sshbio	tudurom: handle?
2016-03-08 17:46:01	tudurom	sshbio: what, you don't know what that is?
2016-03-08 17:46:08	boobah	common term for a nickname
2016-03-08 17:46:34	boobah	something for people to "grip" you by, so to speak
2016-03-08 17:46:48	tudurom	sshbio: like when you mention someone
2016-03-08 17:47:03	sshbio	Oh! I thought about my gandi.net handle!  I imagined that he was a wizard, but not high at this point!
2016-03-08 17:48:34	half	Lol :)
2016-03-08 17:48:38	sshbio	Of course!  I am no native english speaker, and live in France (bad, english speakers).
2016-03-08 17:48:48	tudurom	pfff come to Romania
2016-03-08 17:49:06	half	sshbio: Is it true that France is moving to ban having devices that you cannot unlock?
2016-03-08 17:49:17	half	tudurom: Romania @.o
2016-03-08 17:50:19	sshbio	tudurom: That would be great!  I yet know one Romanian.
2016-03-08 17:50:29	tudurom	:)
2016-03-08 17:50:45	tudurom	it's not that good there
2016-03-08 17:51:14	tudurom	the whole democracy thing since 1989 fucked up the whole country
2016-03-08 17:51:45	sshbio	I heard a bit.  Living there for a life may not be the same story. e_e
2016-03-08 17:52:21	tudurom	there is one fundamental mistake here: the educational system. it just sucks badly
2016-03-08 17:52:33	tudurom	every bad thing evolves from there
2016-03-08 17:53:26	tudurom	but that's some next level off-topic-ness on this channel
2016-03-08 17:53:31	half	XCB_ATOM_WM_NAME isn't the one for st, but
2016-03-08 17:54:02	tudurom	is st better than urxvt?
2016-03-08 17:54:09	sshbio	Education pretty fundamuntal!
2016-03-08 17:54:22	tudurom	sshbio: and it sucks
2016-03-08 17:55:23	half	Lol
2016-03-08 17:55:29	half	tudurom: Not really.
2016-03-08 17:56:07	sshbio	tudurom: from user view, urxvt and st are pretty the same: fullscreen, no GUI.  Configuration of st is made by compiling and do not us Xressources.  On the other hand, it is much lighter and has TRUE COLOR support (maybe urxvt as well, do not know...)
2016-03-08 17:56:24	tudurom	urxvt has a patch and I'm using it right now
2016-03-08 17:56:45	tudurom	i had to tweak some numbers in the st config to make cava look good
2016-03-08 17:56:55	sshbio	And from romania, I also have this > https://youtu.be/QN47lNrcLYQ
2016-03-08 17:56:57	tudurom	changed the framerate from 120 to 3000 or something like that
2016-03-08 17:57:30	tudurom	sshbio: is that some Hungarian song?
2016-03-08 17:58:07	sshbio	No wait hungarian indeed!
2016-03-08 17:58:21	sshbio	This is another one.  Sorry!
2016-03-08 18:00:24	half	sshbio: dcat has an xresources based st!
2016-03-08 18:00:51	half	https://github.com/dcat/st-xresources
2016-03-08 18:01:03	tudurom	aw yes
2016-03-08 18:01:13	sshbio	half: Oh!
2016-03-08 18:01:17	tudurom	no more urxvt patch fuckery
2016-03-08 18:01:45	fsociety	ill check this out :)
2016-03-08 18:01:51	boobah	tudurom: st is unusable for me, but a lot of people like it
2016-03-08 18:01:52	sshbio	half: This is the ricing-st!  Thank
2016-03-08 18:02:10	sshbio	boobah: Scrolling?
2016-03-08 18:02:18	tudurom	i should make an AUR package for it
2016-03-08 18:02:22	tudurom	my first one
2016-03-08 18:02:44	half	They're incredibly simple to make.
2016-03-08 18:02:50	sshbio	Oops! Gottago!  Thank you #nixers wizards!
2016-03-08 18:02:51	boobah	sshbio: no; it's the actual input/output engine that kills it for me
2016-03-08 18:03:16	half	https://ptpb.pw/t6wz.pdf tudurom.
2016-03-08 18:03:21	sshbio	boobah: err... to elaborated for my knowledge for me!
2016-03-08 18:03:49	tudurom	half: bookmarked thanks

2016-03-08 18:03:52	boobah	k there's a high input a
2016-03-08 18:03:57	boobah	whoops
2016-03-08 18:04:07	tudurom	this easter i will install Crux
2016-03-08 18:04:48	half	I should see if this builds on Void
2016-03-08 18:05:02	tudurom	it's just another linux distro
2016-03-08 18:05:09	half	musl variant, sorry.
2016-03-08 18:05:13	tudurom	oh wow
2016-03-08 18:05:34	boobah	half: so the musl flavour comes with busybox, huh?
2016-03-08 18:05:37	half	It hasn't built a few things. Something happened with jansson's malloc
2016-03-08 18:05:42	half	boobah: yeah
2016-03-08 18:05:51	half	busybox/runit/musl
2016-03-08 18:05:52	boobah	half: instead of gnu coreutils
2016-03-08 18:06:02	half	Yeah. 
2016-03-08 18:06:09	boobah	niiiiiiiiiice
2016-03-08 18:06:14	@zn42	yo
2016-03-08 18:06:14	boobah	like alpine!
2016-03-08 18:06:44	half	s/runit/openrc on alpine, I think
2016-03-08 18:06:49	boobah	well yeah
2016-03-08 18:06:55	boobah	and apk instead of xbps
2016-03-08 18:07:53	boobah	i suppose that makes sense though; gnu coreutils might not build properly against other libc's
2016-03-08 18:07:57	half	That's in my other vm :p
2016-03-08 18:08:12	tudurom	there is no version number for st-xresources. what should the pkgver be?
2016-03-08 18:08:23	tudurom	the git commit?
2016-03-08 18:08:28	half	Sec
2016-03-08 18:09:44	half	tudurom: You could just set it to 1, and run a pkgver on it if you want to follow -git
2016-03-08 18:10:12	half	(It's all expounded upon in that pdf)
2016-03-08 18:10:16	tudurom	i see in the pdf
2016-03-08 18:11:31	half	Updating VOID
2016-03-08 18:11:36	half	I'm so hardcore.
2016-03-08 18:12:00	boobah	especially when you capitalize it like that
2016-03-08 18:12:34	tudurom	how should i handle the license?
2016-03-08 18:12:53	tudurom	just license=('MIT/X')?
2016-03-08 18:13:07	half	Whatever his is, yeah
2016-03-08 18:13:52	half	Heh, curl is 126KB
2016-03-08 18:14:12	tudurom	found out the sollution to everything: the original PKGBUILD
2016-03-08 18:15:03	half	Yeah
2016-03-08 18:17:04	half	make
2016-03-08 18:17:09	half	Wrong buffer, sorry

2016-03-08 18:28:14	tudurom	it works!
2016-03-08 18:29:39	tudurom	half: please check it https://p.iotek.org/u3e
2016-03-08 18:30:40	half	I assume you'll want a pkgver function as well
2016-03-08 18:30:47	tudurom	no no
2016-03-08 18:30:53	tudurom	found the version in the makefile
2016-03-08 18:31:06	tudurom	aw it's a git package
2016-03-08 18:31:08	tudurom	you're right
2016-03-08 18:31:29	half	It's so awesome to have those things open up in neovim now
2016-03-08 18:31:33	half	Man am I happy with that.
2016-03-08 18:31:42	tudurom	in neovim?
2016-03-08 18:31:54	@zn42	fyr, nice for underneath.sh
2016-03-08 18:32:22	half	tudurom: Mhmm. I curl in the header, to check the mimetype and open it in the appropriate program :)
2016-03-08 18:32:35	half	It's a second overhead at most
2016-03-08 18:33:04	tudurom	it's just a text file...
2016-03-08 18:33:13	half	Yeah
2016-03-08 18:33:24	half	I don't want my browser opening that shit.
2016-03-08 18:33:33	half	That's a touch overkill
2016-03-08 18:34:57	tudurom	you could simply do in neovim ":r !curl -L <your_url>"
2016-03-08 18:35:40	half	I just hit ctrl+u in weechat, select the link I want, and I don't have to do anything :p
2016-03-08 18:36:21	tudurom	meanwhile, i use irssi and i copy/pase with tmux's ctrl+[
2016-03-08 18:36:42	half	https://ptpb.pw/aKgG.mkv
2016-03-08 18:37:49	half	Just easier than having to have to copy/paste everything all the time.
2016-03-08 18:38:05	tudurom	is that a weechat script?
2016-03-08 18:38:12	half	N
2016-03-08 18:38:15	half	No *
2016-03-08 18:38:56	half	It's based on the externalpipe from st, basically piped through xurls | dmenu
2016-03-08 18:39:13	half	Just that way it's the same in any terminal
2016-03-08 18:39:16	tudurom	ready to switch to st
2016-03-08 18:39:34	half	You can do it easily with rxvt-perls as wel
2016-03-08 18:39:51	tudurom	i think it sucks less if i do it with st
2016-03-08 18:39:56	half	:p
2016-03-08 18:39:57	tudurom	also, i know 0 perl
2016-03-08 18:40:14	half	That's very fair.
2016-03-08 18:40:45	half	Wonder why my vm won't startx ;-;
2016-03-08 18:41:05	tudurom	you have no drivers
2016-03-08 18:41:20	half	Maybe
2016-03-08 18:41:30	tudurom	at least do you have xf86-video-vesa installed?
2016-03-08 18:42:20	half	Yep

2016-03-09 10:37:10	fsociety	changing to amiga font is just for shits and giggles, unfortunately it doesn't play to well with infinality patches
2016-03-09 10:37:42	fsociety	on saying that the teeny fonts you guys use, i find them pretty unreadable as well
2016-03-09 10:39:11	Roonix	speaking of tiny fonts, you guys that use lemon font, is it possible to get it bigger than size 8? That's the max it will go for me without looks shitty

2016-03-10 01:45:35	+seth	skrzyp: my only critique is the graphic has a clear light source, but the entire image rotates, light source included. If you could, you might want to redo the graphic sans light source, or pick an ambient, straight on light source that won't break the illusion of rotation
2016-03-10 01:48:03	+seth	also the reason it rotates off center is because you picked an even pixel dimension (298x298), which, by definition, has no exact center
2016-03-10 01:48:33	+seth	but neat, regardless

2016-03-10 03:06:42	@xero	i see that
2016-03-10 03:06:45	tudurom	i don't even have a domain :(
2016-03-10 03:06:48	@xero	but the names i want are taken
2016-03-10 03:07:01	%stark	xero, How'd you setup code.xero.nu ?
2016-03-10 03:07:09	%stark	Looks really great !
2016-03-10 03:07:20	@xero	stark: it's using my open qoob php framework w/ the git class
2016-03-10 03:07:21	@xero	thanx dude
2016-03-10 03:07:26	tudurom	xero: x-e.ro is available
2016-03-10 03:07:41	@xero	tudurom: yeah, it's only 1 char shorter than xero.nu
2016-03-10 03:08:00	tudurom	but it's cheaper for long-term
2016-03-10 03:08:25	%stark	xero, Can you expand a bit on the git class ?

2016-03-10 03:09:58	tudurom	should i learn php or it's too old?
2016-03-10 03:12:12	@xero	i've used php for 15+ years now. so i'm not a good one to ask.
2016-03-10 03:13:03	S0lll0s	right now Id say its still useful but i dont know how long it will continue to be
2016-03-10 03:13:17	@xero	the newest versions are getting better and better
2016-03-10 03:13:31	@xero	it's still (one of) the fastest and more scaleable web langs
2016-03-10 03:13:42	@xero	w/ php-fpm + nginx 
2016-03-10 03:14:21	tudurom	i should put it on my to-do list just to be there. always learn something new. _always_
2016-03-10 03:15:33	S0lll0s	^
2016-03-10 03:15:55	 - 	S0lll0s is now known as s-ol
2016-03-10 03:16:06	s-ol	i need to look at this for a while i before I buy s-ol.nu i think
2016-03-10 03:21:20	@xero	i've owned so many dumb domains over the years for handles i dont use any more

2016-03-10 03:28:37	@rocx	s-ol: not sol.es?
2016-03-10 03:28:54	tudurom	because.... .ro is cheaper!
2016-03-10 03:28:57	@rocx	ah.
2016-03-10 03:28:58	@xero	rocx: that's taken
2016-03-10 03:29:02	s-ol	oh, there is a free 5char one?
2016-03-10 03:29:05	s-ol	I didnt find any
2016-03-10 03:29:06	@rocx	xero: was checkign but it never came up.
2016-03-10 03:30:28	s-ol	nah sol.es is taken
2016-03-10 03:30:34	@rocx	just covered that.
2016-03-10 03:30:46	s-ol	it would be real weird if it wasnt, sol is a word in spanish even
2016-03-10 03:31:00	tudurom	"sun"?
2016-03-10 03:31:02	s-ol	oh 
2016-03-10 03:31:04	s-ol	yes
2016-03-10 03:31:05	@xero	yup
2016-03-10 03:33:06	tudurom	disclaimer: i don't know even the tiniest bit of spanish
2016-03-10 03:33:39	s-ol	now you know the tiniest bit of spanish
2016-03-10 03:33:53	s-ol	one three-letter word
2016-03-10 03:34:06	@rocx	how do you not even know "hola"?
2016-03-10 03:34:18	tudurom	forgot that one
2016-03-10 03:34:39	@rocx	or even "señor"?
2016-03-10 03:34:51	tudurom	maybe
2016-03-10 03:34:59	tudurom	i know bits of french. but i suck
2016-03-10 03:35:07	@rocx	huh. forgot that vim/evil digraphs can even make ñ/

2016-03-10 03:36:17	@rocx	not as simple as `dd`?
2016-03-10 03:36:37	+fyr	probably
2016-03-10 03:36:47	@rocx	i tried that and never got a disc burned.
2016-03-10 03:36:48	+fyr	but I've literally never used this drive before
2016-03-10 03:36:58	@xero	many people use wodim
2016-03-10 03:36:59	@rocx	and i tried burning with some fancy disc-burning program.
2016-03-10 03:37:01	tudurom	does anyone know how to write "ă" in vim?
2016-03-10 03:37:06	@xero	but i dont even have an optical drive anymore
2016-03-10 03:37:10	+fyr	not even sure where to begin
2016-03-10 03:37:11	@rocx	turns out that my drive can't seem to burn.
2016-03-10 03:37:24	@rocx	tudurom: ヷ

2016-03-10 03:41:34	+seth	I just use the simpler "bs=4m" flag
2016-03-10 03:41:51	+seth	otherwise you're reading 512 bytes and writing 32k ?
2016-03-10 03:41:57	+seth	seems like that would be way slower

2016-03-10 03:47:14	+seth	for the prefix
2016-03-10 03:47:28	@xero	seth, why do you keep nesting them?
2016-03-10 03:47:31	@xero	that seems crazy
2016-03-10 03:47:38	@xero	just attach to them
2016-03-10 03:47:44	+seth	nested as in
2016-03-10 03:47:47	+seth	tmux on local machine
2016-03-10 03:47:49	+seth	tmux on vps
2016-03-10 03:47:51	@xero	no i get it
2016-03-10 03:47:57	@xero	but you can run a session on the vps
2016-03-10 03:48:05	+seth	there is a session on the vps
2016-03-10 03:48:05	@xero	and just attach your local session to the remote one
2016-03-10 03:48:09	+seth	can you?
2016-03-10 03:48:24	+seth	how does that work if the remote session has its own windows
2016-03-10 03:48:59	+seth	oh I see, but I have to toggle active sessions
2016-03-10 03:49:12	@xero	ssh <remote host> -t tmux attach-session
2016-03-10 03:49:12	+seth	ssh <remote host> -t tmux attach-session
2016-03-10 03:49:14	+seth	yeah
2016-03-10 03:49:15	@xero	lD
2016-03-10 03:49:16	+seth	 I see it
2016-03-10 03:49:47	@xero	i like doing 
2016-03-10 03:49:48	@xero	alias servername="ssh servername -t tmux a"
2016-03-10 03:50:04	+seth	what's the default way to switch sessions
2016-03-10 03:50:14	+seth	also, I kind of like having my weechat pane in my local session
2016-03-10 03:50:29	+seth	so I'm not sure I like this multiple session thing 
2016-03-10 03:50:46	+seth	unless that's possible ...
2016-03-10 03:51:40	@xero	i dont get what your asking?
2016-03-10 03:51:47	@xero	`:ls ?
2016-03-10 03:52:01	+seth	it's still nested...
2016-03-10 03:52:06	+seth	like I have 2 status bars
2016-03-10 03:52:34	@xero	yeah idk dude. i usually use dtach on the remote systems
2016-03-10 03:52:38	@xero	and tmux locally
2016-03-10 03:52:47	@xero	have 2 sets of keybinds seems overkill
2016-03-10 03:52:58	+seth	I use ` as local prefix, and f1 as remote
2016-03-10 03:53:09	+seth	it uses if-shell to check for the existence of $SSH_CLIENT var
2016-03-10 03:53:15	+seth	and rebinds the prefix
2016-03-10 03:57:05	+seth	doesn't dtach have its own bindings like screen?
2016-03-10 03:57:21	@xero	i only use one to actually detach it
2016-03-10 03:57:36	@xero	create them via a named alias
2016-03-10 03:57:44	@xero	^\ to detach a session

2016-03-10 04:06:16	+fyr	r/unixporn has such a hardon for i3
2016-03-10 04:06:17	+seth	you have windows
2016-03-10 04:06:20	+seth	and you manage them
2016-03-10 04:06:23	+fyr	I don't understand it
2016-03-10 04:06:35	tudurom	wmutils is a set of programs. i3 is bloat
2016-03-10 04:06:35	+fyr	its an okay wm with good defaults
2016-03-10 04:06:45	+seth	lel bloat
2016-03-10 04:06:46	+fyr	but other than that it's nothing special
2016-03-10 04:06:47	+seth	it's like 5 megs
2016-03-10 04:06:51	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-10 04:07:04	@xero	i've never actually used i3
2016-03-10 04:07:05	+fyr	wmutils *is* technically the lightest wm you can get
2016-03-10 04:07:10	@xero	i kinda looks like herb
2016-03-10 04:07:11	tudurom	there's one program i use from i3, and that's i3lock
2016-03-10 04:07:15	+fyr	as it doesn't do anything unlike you tell it to
2016-03-10 04:07:23	+fyr	now i3lock IS bloat
2016-03-10 04:07:27	+fyr	just use slock
2016-03-10 04:07:33	+seth	honestly, when you use something like bspwm + lemonbar, you're trying to emulate i3's defaults
2016-03-10 04:07:35	tudurom	muh blurred image
2016-03-10 04:07:41	+seth	i3 is just a twm with reasonable defaults
2016-03-10 04:07:46	+fyr	yh
2016-03-10 04:07:48	tudurom	seth: ex bspwm + lemonbar here
2016-03-10 04:07:59	tudurom	bspwm is not i3. 100%
2016-03-10 04:08:05	+seth	it's basically the same
2016-03-10 04:08:08	+seth	it tiles a little different
2016-03-10 04:08:13	+seth	but alt vs super as the prefix
2016-03-10 04:08:17	tudurom	the philosophy is different
2016-03-10 04:08:22	+seth	9_9
2016-03-10 04:08:24	+seth	it's a window manager
2016-03-10 04:08:28	+fyr	binary space tiling
2016-03-10 04:08:30	+seth	it doesn't have a philosophy
2016-03-10 04:08:35	+fyr	very similar algorithms
2016-03-10 04:08:48	tudurom	i3 is like the ubuntu of distros. it is big, fat and ready for everyone. bspwm is cut in halves
2016-03-10 04:09:08	+seth	it's written in C
2016-03-10 04:09:10	+seth	how is it bloated
2016-03-10 04:09:14	+seth	I'm not understanding
2016-03-10 04:09:20	tudurom	i3?
2016-03-10 04:09:22	+seth	yes
2016-03-10 04:09:34	tudurom	the fact that is uses its own config language scares me

2016-03-10 04:09:40	+seth	so does sxhkd 
2016-03-10 04:09:42	+seth	and bspwm
2016-03-10 04:09:55	+fyr	you could argue it's not very *portable*
2016-03-10 04:09:59	tudurom	bspwm uses scripts that call bspc
2016-03-10 04:09:59	+seth	lel
2016-03-10 04:10:09	+seth	bspwm is two broken halves that  you hack together
2016-03-10 04:10:11	+fyr	even I don't think it's very bloated
2016-03-10 04:10:17	+seth	afaik nothing else uses sxhkd
2016-03-10 04:10:20	+fyr	well
2016-03-10 04:10:23	tudurom	bspwm i a cleaner alternative to i3
2016-03-10 04:10:26	+fyr	wmutils ,)
2016-03-10 04:10:32	+seth	cleaner as in... bspwm doesn't work out of the box really
2016-03-10 04:10:39	+seth	no status bar 
2016-03-10 04:10:47	tudurom	it lets you think more
2016-03-10 04:10:56	tudurom	and then wmutils comes in action
2016-03-10 04:10:58	+seth	I'm sure you could hack i3 to look like bspwm and vice versa
2016-03-10 04:11:10	+fyr	dunno
2016-03-10 04:11:16	+fyr	i3 isn't very customisable
2016-03-10 04:11:28	+seth	like... I thought the resistance on unixporn towards i3 is cause people fucking apt-get install it, set a wallpaper and scrot
2016-03-10 04:11:34	+seth	"look at my sexy generic setup"
2016-03-10 04:11:40	+fyr	man
2016-03-10 04:11:48	+fyr	when people don't even bother changing i3 defaults
2016-03-10 04:11:50	+fyr	and posting
2016-03-10 04:11:52	+seth	^
2016-03-10 04:11:56	tudurom	^^
2016-03-10 04:12:06	+seth	honestly I didn't mind i3 that much, but it wasn't l33t enough
2016-03-10 04:12:15	+seth	so I spent 3 hours fucking with sxhkd and bspwm
2016-03-10 04:12:21	+seth	and still can't get lemonbar to work
2016-03-10 04:12:21	+fyr	me neither
2016-03-10 04:12:25	+fyr	eh
2016-03-10 04:12:29	+fyr	what's wrong?
2016-03-10 04:12:35	+seth	something something dpi
2016-03-10 04:12:40	+seth	and I stole someone's dots for the look
2016-03-10 04:12:46	+seth	it was throwing font errors
2016-03-10 04:12:51	+seth	and it's a pain in the ass to find fonts on arch
2016-03-10 04:12:54	+fyr	eh
2016-03-10 04:12:58	tudurom	github.com/tudurom/dotfiles
2016-03-10 04:13:01	tudurom	kept them safe
2016-03-10 04:13:07	+fyr	I think there is an xft patch if you want to use that
2016-03-10 04:13:09	+seth	I have dots, maybe not on my arch
2016-03-10 04:13:15	+seth	my dots work on windows / osx / linux
2016-03-10 04:13:16	tudurom	the xft patch is very outdated
2016-03-10 04:13:18	+fyr	otherwise it'll accept bitmapped fonts fine
2016-03-10 04:13:40	+seth	lots of uname -s checking
2016-03-10 04:13:46	tudurom	pro tip: lemonbar has a flag -U that changes the global underline color
2016-03-10 04:13:58	+fyr	psh underline color
2016-03-10 04:14:15	+fyr	just launch another lemonbar instance around the actual infobar
2016-03-10 04:14:25	+fyr	there's your border
2016-03-10 04:14:32	+seth	just fill your screen with lemonbars
2016-03-10 04:14:37	+fyr	yep
2016-03-10 04:14:53	+seth	then have each one act like a single line of a terminal
2016-03-10 04:14:56	+fyr	only thing that annoys me about lemonbar is that it can't dynamically resize
2016-03-10 04:14:59	tudurom	i sugested that flag...
2016-03-10 04:15:10	tudurom	^^
2016-03-10 04:15:23	+fyr	would be really sweet for my groups info bar
2016-03-10 04:15:49	tudurom	would be really sweet for my music bar
2016-03-10 04:15:51	tudurom	it's just huge
2016-03-10 04:16:08	tudurom	there's this neat tool called txtw by baskerville

2016-03-10 04:28:05	@xero	it's kinda font spesific. it doesn't always look very good
2016-03-10 04:29:03	+fyr	http://pub.iotek.org/p/vNsoQVb.png looks good with lemon
2016-03-10 04:29:27	tudurom	can you read that?

2016-03-10 04:29:52	tudurom	do you have 9-inch eyes?

2016-03-10 04:30:18	@xero	lemon/line/neep/creep are beautiful. but very very small
2016-03-10 04:30:41	tudurom	gohu 14 is just perfect
2016-03-10 04:30:47	tudurom	i put small fonts on bars
2016-03-10 04:31:00	tudurom	(and i think everyone does that)
2016-03-10 04:31:32	+fyr	been thinking of building up some more lemon chars
2016-03-10 04:31:37	+fyr	it's missing quite a few
2016-03-10 04:32:21	tudurom	do you have this? ă
2016-03-10 04:32:24	+fyr	yh
2016-03-10 04:32:30	+fyr	looks kinda weird now

2016-03-10 04:32:49	+fyr	http://pub.iotek.org/p/MX9A3jM.png
2016-03-10 04:33:06	@xero	looks fine
2016-03-10 04:33:07	tudurom	kek
2016-03-10 04:33:11	@xero	just like it does in gohu
2016-03-10 04:33:20	+fyr	well when I say weird
2016-03-10 04:33:22	tudurom	in gohu looks smaller than it should for me
2016-03-10 04:33:28	+fyr	it doesn't look like a lemon char
2016-03-10 04:33:36	@xero	oh, fair
2016-03-10 04:33:54	tudurom	fyi that's some romanian character that i bet you can't pronounce
2016-03-10 04:34:38	@xero	it's a schwa right?
2016-03-10 04:34:40	@xero	 /ə/,
2016-03-10 04:35:06	+fyr	ah
2016-03-10 04:35:19	+fyr	a char that doesn't have a lemon char!
2016-03-10 04:35:34	+fyr	just prints out a sorta block shape
2016-03-10 04:35:41	@xero	it's the upside down e
2016-03-10 04:35:45	+fyr	yh
2016-03-10 04:35:54	@xero	do you use a fallback font too?
2016-03-10 04:35:59	+fyr	no
2016-03-10 04:36:07	+fyr	didn't know you could do that
2016-03-10 04:36:18	tudurom	gotta search what's a schwa
2016-03-10 04:36:20	@xero	in urxvt you just define two fonts
2016-03-10 04:36:30	@xero	tudurom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa
2016-03-10 04:36:33	tudurom	found it
2016-03-10 04:36:57	tudurom	they're similar but it's not the same
2016-03-10 04:36:57	@xero	fyr
2016-03-10 04:36:58	@xero	urxvt*font: xft:gohufont:size=11:antialias=false:hinting=slight, \ xft:Symbola:pixelsize=14:antialias=true:hinting=slight
2016-03-10 04:37:04	tudurom	why xft???
2016-03-10 04:37:29	@xero	symbola
2016-03-10 04:37:40	@xero	both fonts have to be the same (e.g. use xft or not)
2016-03-10 04:37:51	@xero	and symbola looks utterly disgusting w/o it
2016-03-10 04:38:09	@xero	but i need all those chars b/c gohu is a pretty limited font
2016-03-10 04:38:10	tudurom	i use xlfd for gohu and xft for symbola. it just works
2016-03-10 04:38:16	@xero	interesting
2016-03-10 04:39:01	@xero	crashes urxvt for me
2016-03-10 04:39:11	tudurom	according to wikipedia, ă is a schwa
2016-03-10 04:39:18	tudurom	i use a 24-bit color patched urxvt btw
2016-03-10 04:39:29	@xero	oh

2016-03-10 04:43:21	+fyr	huh how 2 burn mp3 files with wodim
2016-03-10 04:43:52	tudurom	why you don't use an usb stick?
2016-03-10 04:43:57	+fyr	I don't want to burn on to it as a data iso as it won't play on anything
2016-03-10 04:44:11	+fyr	tudurom, because it'll need to be used in a cd player in a car?
2016-03-10 04:45:15	tudurom	do you have the patience to compile brasero?
2016-03-10 04:46:19	tudurom	according to the wodim manpage, you just burn them as wodim dev=<device> <list of tracks>
2016-03-10 04:46:35	+fyr	yes but it apparently doesn't work with mp3
2016-03-10 04:46:57	+fyr	and mp3 tends to have the best compression
2016-03-10 04:47:30	tudurom	wodim makes them into native cd audio so it doesn't matter
2016-03-10 04:47:40	tudurom	convert them
2016-03-10 04:47:55	+fyr	you're probably right but I'm worrying about the data sizes
2016-03-10 04:48:55	+fyr	yeah
2016-03-10 04:49:13	+fyr	from 600 mbs which would fit on a cd to 2.3gb
2016-03-10 04:49:15	+fyr	:/
2016-03-10 04:49:28	+fyr	maybe there's a better conversion method..
2016-03-10 04:50:12	tudurom	maybe you should use two disks
2016-03-10 04:50:22	half	Ahh, Megadeth was good.
2016-03-10 04:50:24	+fyr	more like I would be using 3

2016-03-10 04:50:47	+fyr	yeah I don't want to waste disks

2016-03-10 05:53:18	half	I never saw Golang as a small systems programming language
2016-03-10 05:53:32	half	It always screamed a distributed systems' language, at least.
2016-03-10 05:53:35	+seth	half: it's designed for systems programming and it excels at it
2016-03-10 05:53:41	@rocx	half: imagine that, it was designed for that.
2016-03-10 05:53:49	tudurom	for go: see syncthing and ipfs
2016-03-10 05:54:12	half	TIL, oh my.
2016-03-10 05:54:23	+seth	it's really simple to make your application multithreaded
2016-03-10 05:54:24	@rocx	it did start as alef for plan 9.
2016-03-10 05:54:30	+seth	just add "go" before the func call
2016-03-10 05:54:35	+seth	boom, starts in a goroutine
2016-03-10 05:54:52	%kirby	I use Perl for basically all my scripting, and cpan is fine
2016-03-10 05:54:55	+seth	but then you need a mutex in your main thread or it will exit before your thread completes
2016-03-10 05:55:05	+seth	child thread* completes
2016-03-10 05:55:11	@rocx	yeah i'm sticking with perl6. other languages broke me and this is more of a language for solving my kind of problems.]
2016-03-10 05:55:13	half	I've ben meaning to learn it, just haven't had the will to invest the time
2016-03-10 05:55:27	%kirby	And I thought Goroutines weren't proper threads?
2016-03-10 05:55:51	%kirby	I've done some very light research on it for my project (which is due in less than a day and still nowhere near finished fml).

2016-03-10 05:58:20	half	That's kiiiind of a no-op to state.
2016-03-10 05:58:35	half	There's information collated in books, and sprawled across other sources.
2016-03-10 05:58:45	@xero	seth: some are some aren't
2016-03-10 05:58:46	half	I prefer the former, as it's terse.

2016-03-10 05:59:01	@xero	i'm still reading "mastering regular expressions" 
2016-03-10 05:59:05	+seth	I learn by doing, not really by reading
2016-03-10 05:59:09	@xero	it's been like almost a year now
2016-03-10 05:59:14	@xero	it's like chewing on gravel
2016-03-10 05:59:17	+seth	lmao
2016-03-10 05:59:22	@xero	but the info in the book is _really_ good
2016-03-10 05:59:26	tudurom	seth: by reading it, it's easier to memorize
2016-03-10 05:59:28	@xero	i learn something every time i read it
2016-03-10 05:59:31	+seth	tudurom: for you maybe
2016-03-10 05:59:36	+seth	for me, typing it out is the fastest way
2016-03-10 05:59:41	tudurom	try it
2016-03-10 05:59:48	+seth	I HAVE read books before lol
2016-03-10 05:59:53	+seth	I was homeschooled
2016-03-10 05:59:59	+seth	had to do textbooks cover to cover
2016-03-10 06:00:01	+seth	hate textbooks
2016-03-10 06:00:01	tudurom	how cool is that
2016-03-10 06:00:18	tudurom	you should try a programming book
2016-03-10 06:00:26	tudurom	just read the "theory" and that's it
2016-03-10 06:00:31	+seth	I could try one
2016-03-10 06:00:32	half	Heh. 
2016-03-10 06:00:34	+seth	but if the author is dry
2016-03-10 06:00:35	+seth	I'm going to hate it
2016-03-10 06:00:52	tudurom	i know the perfect one!
2016-03-10 06:01:08	half	Wirth, Dijkstra, Dahl, Hoare, Knuth, et al are worth reading.
2016-03-10 06:01:21	+seth	Wasn't Dijkstra high on acid half the time?
2016-03-10 06:01:22	tudurom	http://learnyouahaskell.com/
2016-03-10 06:01:23	%kirby	One of the reasons I like Perl is because I've read 'Learning' and 'Intermediate' published by O'Reilly and I enjoyed both of them.
2016-03-10 06:01:43	@zn42	sup there wankers?
2016-03-10 06:01:46	tudurom	learn you a haskell is a good one imo
2016-03-10 06:01:48	+seth	I tried a perl book once
2016-03-10 06:01:54	%kirby	Can also vouch for Learn You a Haskell is also really good
2016-03-10 06:01:57	@rocx	kirby: if it makes you feel any better, i have the llama book.
2016-03-10 06:01:57	half	That's probably why you hated it.
2016-03-10 06:01:58	@xero	zn42: discussing programming books
2016-03-10 06:01:59	+seth	tudurom: if FP had any application for my career...
2016-03-10 06:02:03	@zn42	uggh
2016-03-10 06:02:05	+seth	which it does not lol
2016-03-10 06:02:11	%kirby	Yeah that's 'Learning', it's pretty good
2016-03-10 06:02:12	half	zn42: Not much.
2016-03-10 06:02:16	@zn42	xero, btw, could you connect to the VPN?
2016-03-10 06:02:26	@xero	i was super busy last night
2016-03-10 06:02:30	@xero	and i didnt try from home
2016-03-10 06:02:33	tudurom	when you learn haskell, you dont learn only the language. you also learn the concept
2016-03-10 06:02:35	half	I was watching concert last night :3
2016-03-10 06:02:36	@zn42	no prob :)
2016-03-10 06:02:42	*	tudurom knows only a tiny bit oh haskell
2016-03-10 06:02:53	half	tudurom: s/haskell/functional programming, really
2016-03-10 06:02:57	@zn42	ONLY ONE DEDIBOX REMAINING!!!
2016-03-10 06:03:28	half	tudurom: It was very illuminating, though
2016-03-10 06:03:39	half	tudurom: did a bunch of the Euler challenges :3
2016-03-10 06:04:16	tudurom	functional programming is... interesting
2016-03-10 06:04:27	tudurom	but it's more for humans, less for computers imo
2016-03-10 06:04:42	@rocx	tudurom: remember one of the mantas of programming?
2016-03-10 06:04:48	@rocx	make programs for humans, not computers.
2016-03-10 06:04:54	tudurom	yes
2016-03-10 06:05:09	*	tudurom points to glibc
2016-03-10 06:05:28	@rocx	C isn't a very easy language to make programs for humans with.
2016-03-10 06:06:02	tudurom	if we're talking about programs for humans, we end up with ruby. which stinks
2016-03-10 06:06:11	@rocx	the block notation in ruby's silly.
2016-03-10 06:06:20	@rocx	the |i| part.
2016-03-10 06:06:31	tudurom	my head hurts when i see them
2016-03-10 06:06:45	half	I don't see how that means your programming language has to be for humans, you're programming an electronic computer to paint a representation of something non-electrical for consupmtion by humans
2016-03-10 06:06:56	tudurom	half: see assembly
2016-03-10 06:07:01	@rocx	half: you're not going to be the only one reading your code for the most part.
2016-03-10 06:07:01	tudurom	you need to understand it
2016-03-10 06:07:04	half	The steps in between should be about what achieves that with efficiency and safety, weighed against time
2016-03-10 06:07:11	half	tudurom: I do :p
2016-03-10 06:07:49	+seth	foo.each do |bar|
2016-03-10 06:07:51	+seth	so legible
2016-03-10 06:07:59	half	rocx: That's another thing I try to be mindful of in what I do, yeah.
2016-03-10 06:08:19	half	The notion that it should be easy though, and mindless needs to get right fucked.

2016-03-10 06:10:43	@rocx	*my ruby's ridiculously rusty thankfully.
2016-03-10 06:10:50	tudurom	so, what's a good scripting language?
2016-03-10 06:10:53	+seth	python
2016-03-10 06:10:54	@xero	so much devops stuff is writtin in ruby
2016-03-10 06:10:58	@xero	it sux
2016-03-10 06:11:04	@rocx	i'd say against python.
2016-03-10 06:11:08	@rocx	does way too much for you
2016-03-10 06:11:09	tudurom	seth: that indention kills me
2016-03-10 06:11:11	+seth	it's preinstalled on every system

2016-03-10 06:11:17	+seth	^ lel
2016-03-10 06:11:21	+seth	he said language xero
2016-03-10 06:11:24	@rocx	but a shell shouldn't be a real programming/scripting ground.
2016-03-10 06:11:33	+seth	I don't think "if" and "for" count as a complete lang :P
2016-03-10 06:11:36	@rocx	just a glue to connect a couple of programs together, conditionally.
2016-03-10 06:11:38	half	It's glue :p
2016-03-10 06:11:43	@xero	when you say scripting, i think shell
2016-03-10 06:11:47	@xero	what do you want from me?!
2016-03-10 06:11:48	@xero	lel
2016-03-10 06:11:50	+seth	but he said language kekl
2016-03-10 06:11:51	tudurom	shell scripts are just the script (the story) that tells the actors (programs) how to behave
2016-03-10 06:11:52	@rocx	when you say shell, i think REPL.
2016-03-10 06:12:24	@xero	when i say shell you think >emacs
2016-03-10 06:12:26	half	I have been meaning to do more with Lua, but I'm a little trepidatious.
2016-03-10 06:12:29	+seth	python is installed on most linux distros
2016-03-10 06:12:32	+seth	it's portable
2016-03-10 06:12:37	+seth	the indentation doesn't kill you
2016-03-10 06:12:39	@rocx	no no no. REPL.
2016-03-10 06:12:44	@xero	seth: yeah, but is it 2 or 3?
2016-03-10 06:12:45	+seth	any sane language will have indentation
2016-03-10 06:12:52	tudurom	when you say emacs i think ur mom
2016-03-10 06:12:56	+seth	xero: depends on whether you called #!/usr/bin/env python
2016-03-10 06:12:57	@xero	seth: yes, but indentation shouldnt lead the lang
2016-03-10 06:13:00	+seth	or #!/usr/bin/env python3
2016-03-10 06:13:08	+seth	xero: semicolons rule everywhere else
2016-03-10 06:13:23	+seth	golang considers line breaks semi colons too
2016-03-10 06:13:32	tudurom	is golang a scripting language?
2016-03-10 06:13:40	+seth	not really
2016-03-10 06:13:51	+seth	you can use it for that
2016-03-10 06:13:56	+seth	but you'll end up with a statically compiled binary
2016-03-10 06:14:01	 - 	xero has changed topic for #nixers from "being original is way cooler that hip #THERICEGODSHAVESPOKEN" to "semi-colons rule everything around me: SCREAM!"
2016-03-10 06:14:05	half	I don't think Python should be used to write a damn browser though. 
2016-03-10 06:14:12	+seth	and you'd have to cross compile for each arch and OS

2016-03-10 06:14:31	+seth	-- this is a comment
2016-03-10 06:14:33	+seth	I'm out already
2016-03-10 06:14:34	tudurom	lua has a purpose
2016-03-10 06:14:37	half	(I mean, it's just some chroming over webkit, but)
2016-03-10 06:14:45	+seth	lua is meant to be embedded in your C{,++} app
2016-03-10 06:14:48	+seth	that's not really a purpose
2016-03-10 06:14:57	tudurom	and to be easily evaluated by the machines
2016-03-10 06:15:01	half	seth: So you can dynamically modify the runtime logic without recomplitation
2016-03-10 06:15:02	tudurom	lua it the key to the matrix
2016-03-10 06:15:24	+seth	half: yeah, but lua itself doesn't stand very strong 
2016-03-10 06:15:29	+seth	afaik the package managers all suck
2016-03-10 06:15:32	*	tudurom waits for a serious scripting language to appear
2016-03-10 06:15:33	half	seth: Pretty niche, it semes.
2016-03-10 06:15:50	half	seems *
2016-03-10 06:15:50	+seth	like I was copy pasting snippets to do common operations
2016-03-10 06:15:55	+seth	it is not a "batteries included" language
2016-03-10 06:16:14	tudurom	i want python with brackets
2016-03-10 06:16:20	@rocx	nim?
2016-03-10 06:16:21	@rocx	no wait.
2016-03-10 06:16:45	+seth	golang then
2016-03-10 06:16:49	+seth	it's inspired by python
2016-03-10 06:16:52	tudurom	will do
2016-03-10 06:16:54	+seth	and C
2016-03-10 06:16:56	half	tudurom: You gotta weigh your syntax preferences against community, documentation, etc. 
2016-03-10 06:17:00	@xero	tudurom dies waiting
2016-03-10 06:17:09	+seth	haha
2016-03-10 06:17:10	*	tudurom dieded once again
2016-03-10 06:17:27	half	tudurom: So you go with some unknown language, you pretty much have to LearnFooTheHardWay

2016-03-10 11:17:48	hyporhiz	fyr: it sounds like its for hosting things, maybe a website, or a minecraft server. I don't have a need for anything like that atm.

2016-03-10 11:18:28	hyporhiz	yes

2016-03-10 11:18:34	arc	they're very useful
2016-03-10 11:18:37	hyporhiz	so to stay private with the irc bouncer?

2016-03-10 11:18:54	%adam	you could do that but this server masks IP addresses anyways
2016-03-10 11:19:03	arc	i use the iotek vps to keep irc all the time
2016-03-10 11:19:29	hyporhiz	what do you mean by keep irc?
2016-03-10 11:19:38	%adam	so you dont need to disconnect

2016-03-10 11:19:53	arc	i use my vps to host my website, gopher, steakbot, @animeeveryword, git, vpn, etc.
2016-03-10 11:20:37	arc	steakbot is a dumb irc bot
2016-03-10 11:20:44	hyporhiz	ok
2016-03-10 11:20:56	fsociety	ahh bnc's
2016-03-10 11:20:59	%adam	just a suggestion
2016-03-10 11:21:06	hyporhiz	yeah, atm I am not in the need to host anything for other people
2016-03-10 11:21:09	arc	i just ssh into a vps and run irssi
2016-03-10 11:21:21	arc	what distro are you running hyporhiz
2016-03-10 11:21:25	arc	what general choices of software
2016-03-10 11:21:30	arc	out of curiosity
2016-03-10 11:21:32	hyporhiz	arch
2016-03-10 11:21:37	hyporhiz	xfce
2016-03-10 11:21:37	%adam	damn
2016-03-10 11:21:41	%adam	new user using arch
2016-03-10 11:21:45	arc	by god 
2016-03-10 11:21:54	%adam	i guess once you get it setup its just like debian/ubuntu
2016-03-10 11:21:55	hyporhiz	and very minimal everything besides efce
2016-03-10 11:22:13	hyporhiz	i was on bspwm
2016-03-10 11:22:18	arc	we have a user actually USING their computer rather than ricing it all the time and running some hipster wm and crux and tweaking confs all the time
2016-03-10 11:22:25	arc	by GOD who ARE YOU hyporhiz 
2016-03-10 11:22:35	%adam	 /s
2016-03-10 11:22:41	hyporhiz	trust me ive spent days ricing bspwm
2016-03-10 11:22:50	arc	only days?
2016-03-10 11:22:53	hyporhiz	it's just switching to linux full time
2016-03-10 11:22:59	hyporhiz	means i need cs go
2016-03-10 11:23:05	hyporhiz	which requires something a little more than bspwm
2016-03-10 11:23:08	%adam	cs go isnt ported?
2016-03-10 11:23:12	arc	it is
2016-03-10 11:23:13	%adam	oh i see
2016-03-10 11:23:17	arc	but badly
2016-03-10 11:23:40	hyporhiz	it runs fine for me, idk what arc keeps going on about
2016-03-10 11:23:43	fsociety	arc: speak for yourself. i hardly rice
2016-03-10 11:23:50	arc	my rice is mostly done
2016-03-10 11:23:55	arc	i just change the wallpaper every so often
2016-03-10 11:23:57	%adam	lol
2016-03-10 11:24:02	%adam	mostly done
2016-03-10 11:24:08	%adam	cmon arc
2016-03-10 11:24:11	%adam	ur never done
2016-03-10 11:24:24	%adam	ive been ricing
2016-03-10 11:24:26	fsociety	arc: so does that mean every time you post on unixporn its just a wallpaper change. haha
2016-03-10 11:24:29	%adam	for 5 YEARS
2016-03-10 11:25:03	arc	fsociety: as of late
2016-03-10 11:25:06	arc	sometimes yes
2016-03-10 11:25:16	arc	most of the time they're very minor tweaks
2016-03-10 11:25:37	%adam	hyporhiz: welcome to nixers, by the way. i presume youre a new member too?
2016-03-10 11:25:45	josm	fsociety: mate, you rice a lot

2016-03-10 11:27:15	%adam	vypr: u got linux on one of ur machines yet?
2016-03-10 11:27:18	fsociety	josm: yeah trust me im trying not to

2016-03-10 11:27:43	%vypr	hehe
2016-03-10 11:27:48	josm	i'll shut up then, fsociety :V
2016-03-10 11:27:55	fsociety	I use my computer productively all the time, cause well.. cause I have to for work ;)
2016-03-10 11:28:04	fsociety	josm: all good :)
2016-03-10 11:28:21	josm	my friend just bought one, but it makes him cough
2016-03-10 11:28:27	%vypr	adam: i wish i could do something else, but i can't
2016-03-10 11:28:34	%adam	drivers?
2016-03-10 11:28:37	josm	he should really stop using tobacco though
2016-03-10 11:28:43	%vypr	adam: pretty much
2016-03-10 11:28:46	%adam	hm
2016-03-10 11:28:49	%vypr	the wifi driver is in linux
2016-03-10 11:28:59	half	arc: looks good though
2016-03-10 11:29:00	%vypr	but for some reason livecds don't compile it in there
2016-03-10 11:29:03	fsociety	josm: it can do that, depends on the juices you get
2016-03-10 11:29:06	half	arc: I've been on the same stuff for about a month
2016-03-10 11:29:12	%adam	theoretically if linux mint works any distro should
2016-03-10 11:29:16	%adam	but i understand
2016-03-10 11:29:19	josm	fsociety: ah, that's interesting. I'll tell him.
2016-03-10 11:29:24	%vypr	and you're right
2016-03-10 11:29:30	half	arc: Forgive me, 2 months.
2016-03-10 11:29:41	%vypr	but if i can't get past the install, then so much good that does me
2016-03-10 11:29:45	josm	he's kind of an idiot when it comes to vaping, he's been smoking for at least 7 years now though
2016-03-10 11:29:49	%adam	i feel that
2016-03-10 11:29:53	%adam	i do that sometimes too
2016-03-10 11:30:10	half	There's a guy on #archlinux that's rather in to vaping
2016-03-10 11:30:22	half	Made me want to try it :p
2016-03-10 11:30:32	%vypr	so today i made a funny
2016-03-10 11:30:47	josm	do you smoke though, half?
2016-03-10 11:30:58	%vypr	a common thing in /r/Buddhism is people will think that they're enlightened and make a post saying so
2016-03-10 11:30:59	josm	I don't really see the point unless you smoke already
2016-03-10 11:31:04	%vypr	and it tends to be a bit odd, as always.
2016-03-10 11:31:09	hyporhiz	http://imgur.com/PDXkfrA
2016-03-10 11:31:09	%vypr	generally a bit delusional
2016-03-10 11:31:13	%adam	time fo din din
2016-03-10 11:31:14	fsociety	josm: yeah i had been smoking for about 14 years.. friend gave me a vape for free.  it worked well, didn't stop the carcengenic addiction, it did resolve the nicotine one though.  was still a little grumpy
2016-03-10 11:31:24	half	josm: Not anymore, no.
2016-03-10 11:31:45	josm	fsociety: interesting
2016-03-10 11:31:57	half	19-26 I smoked, definitely not 14 years :O
2016-03-10 11:32:00	josm	half: ah, I mean, well, you can get nicotine-less vapes, right?
2016-03-10 11:32:05	half	fsociety: Did you quit cold turkey? 
2016-03-10 11:32:13	fsociety	half: yup
2016-03-10 11:32:25	half	josm: Yeah. You can get marijuana as well
2016-03-10 11:32:31	half	fsociety: Fuck, bravo!
2016-03-10 11:32:32	josm	that's interesting
2016-03-10 11:32:44	half	fsociety: (Chantix, yay horrible dreams for weeks)
2016-03-10 11:32:52	josm	the nicotine-less/no drug ones are a bit pointless tbh
2016-03-10 11:33:20	josm	I guess at that point it's more about the hardware that what you're actually "smoking"
2016-03-10 11:35:21	%vypr	half: my dad used that a awful lot
2016-03-10 11:35:25	fsociety	josm: haha yeah, some people get obsessed about it. i just use it to facilitate my journey into actually getting healthier
2016-03-10 11:36:24	josm	I definitely want my friend to give it more of a go
2016-03-10 11:36:39	josm	smoking tobacco/cigs are stupidly bad
2016-03-10 11:37:15	half	+1 that.
2016-03-10 11:37:32	half	My parents smoked a lot, in the house. Looking back, I was a prime candidate to start :p
2016-03-10 11:37:46	josm	ah you see, same with my parents
2016-03-10 11:37:50	josm	I didn't start
2016-03-10 11:38:03	josm	I think my mother even smoking during pregnacy
2016-03-10 11:38:16	josm	which is really bad
2016-03-10 11:38:17	+fyr	hyporhiz, stop scrotting yourself
2016-03-10 11:38:53	fsociety	josm: my mum did the same thing
2016-03-10 11:39:03	fsociety	but smoking back then was a bit more liberal.. haha
2016-03-10 11:39:23	hyporhiz	can't help it sometimes T_T
2016-03-10 11:39:32	hyporhiz	thats old though
2016-03-10 11:39:36	half	josm: Yeah. Same.
2016-03-10 11:39:45	half	They just didn't know like we do.
2016-03-10 11:46:49	boobah	hyporhiz: there's ... not much going on there, is there? :)
2016-03-10 11:47:32	hyporhiz	boobah: simple is good ^^
2016-03-10 11:48:18	hyporhiz	boobah i couldnt get the terminal colors right 
2016-03-10 11:52:23	boobah	hyporhiz: i just meant there's nothing happening in the screenshot, lol
2016-03-10 11:52:34	boobah	hyporhiz: typically people at least pretend to be busy
2016-03-10 11:52:42	boobah	hyporhiz: it's all good though, i like the colours
2016-03-10 11:53:39	josm	wait, what's wrong with the IOtek vps?
2016-03-10 11:54:50	hyporhiz	http://imgur.com/nhtv3we
2016-03-10 11:55:08	+fyr	>not posting the direct image link
2016-03-10 11:55:09	josm	doesn't that hurt your eyes?
2016-03-10 11:55:22	*	fyr should write a wrapper
2016-03-10 11:55:39	half	Damn that's hidpi
2016-03-10 11:56:49	hyporhiz	fyr: again im not sure what a wrapper is im new to this stuff
2016-03-10 11:58:40	+fyr	https://github.com/Wildefyr/bin/blob/master/load
2016-03-10 11:58:51	+fyr	it phrases urls for me
2016-03-10 11:59:02	+fyr	you didn't link a direct imgur link
2016-03-10 11:59:16	+fyr	so it gets loaded in the web browser :<
2016-03-10 11:59:28	half	Hm
2016-03-10 11:59:30	half	Mine works
2016-03-10 12:00:24	 < 	greduan (greduan@Clk-A5A73D4E.static.axtel.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
2016-03-10 12:00:32	hyporhiz	will try and understand this bash you linked
2016-03-10 12:00:46	+fyr	that's because I haven't written an imgur rule yet half 
2016-03-10 12:01:39	half	curl -s http://i.imgur.com/"${1: -7}".png | exec imv -
2016-03-10 12:01:43	half	Hm, I could fix that now.
2016-03-10 12:02:39	+fyr	I use a download script to put downloaded images into a tmp dir
2016-03-10 12:02:55	+fyr	that way if I close the image and reopen it I don't have to redownload it :)

2016-03-10 12:05:12	hyporhiz	so you use mediadownloader?
2016-03-10 12:05:20	half	There, now it should handle stupid edge cases.
2016-03-10 12:05:47	+fyr	hyporhiz, just a script: https://github.com/Wildefyr/bin/blob/master/mediad
2016-03-10 12:05:57	half	fyr: Was it you who showed that you could use mpv on gallery links from imgur?
2016-03-10 12:06:03	+fyr	half, nope
2016-03-10 12:06:08	+fyr	btw I'm stealing that
2016-03-10 12:06:21	half	Hm. It was here, anyways. mpv is masterrace
2016-03-10 12:06:39	+fyr	yes
2016-03-10 12:06:42	boobah	hyporhiz: i'd recommend turning down your vim tabstop
2016-03-10 12:06:48	+fyr	even for images :^)
2016-03-10 12:07:02	hyporhiz	pretty sure its at 4 atm
2016-03-10 12:07:09	boobah	fyr: hey, at least he didn't post a JPEG
2016-03-10 12:07:17	+fyr	true
2016-03-10 12:07:19	hyporhiz	fyr: so did you mean you needed to update your script so you could view images from imgur?
2016-03-10 12:07:25	half	fyr: Ohhhh. I still like imv for my zoomage. I guess mpv probably has scrolling and the like?
2016-03-10 12:07:26	boobah	hyporhiz: 8 in the picture, just sayin'
2016-03-10 12:07:40	hyporhiz	boobah: i changed it today ^^
2016-03-10 12:07:42	josm	BAH
2016-03-10 12:07:43	boobah	good
2016-03-10 12:07:48	josm	I can't downgrade on DO
2016-03-10 12:07:52	josm	bastards
2016-03-10 12:07:52	half	oh, you can pipeline imv to do selection based on a set of images. It'll send the selections path to stdout.
2016-03-10 12:08:03	half	Like sxiv iirc
2016-03-10 12:08:10	boobah	yea, `sxiv -o`
2016-03-10 12:08:14	+fyr	half, yeah it has a zoom and pan scan
2016-03-10 12:08:26	half	fyr: Oh yeah, then it's good enough for sure. 
2016-03-10 12:08:53	+fyr	no defaults for them though admittedly
2016-03-10 12:08:54	boobah	the status bar is what keeps me on sxiv. i like having the resolution and size information.
2016-03-10 12:09:03	hyporhiz	fyr: i like the idea though, although i don't know enough bash to right one myself
2016-03-10 12:09:10	hyporhiz	write
2016-03-10 12:09:17	half	fyr: You've been to the depths of mpv though. 
2016-03-10 12:09:28	+fyr	to protect and serve the mpv
2016-03-10 12:09:31	half	fyr: I was trying to pipe my current playlist to dmenu and got bogged down :p
2016-03-10 12:09:57	+fyr	hyporhiz, just look at examples
2016-03-10 12:10:04	+fyr	how I got going
2016-03-10 12:10:13	+fyr	although look at mine and no one elses
2016-03-10 12:10:16	+fyr	bash is shit
2016-03-10 12:10:20	+fyr	dash is love
2016-03-10 12:10:24	+fyr	dash is life
2016-03-10 12:10:28	half	fyr: (for what it's worth, I'm going to steal your implementation and use it for my needs)
2016-03-10 12:10:37	+fyr	nice
2016-03-10 12:11:37	hyporhiz	I got upset with the lack of bash excercises on the greg's bash wiki, so i started learning c instead today
2016-03-10 12:11:50	half	C is really useful to know.
2016-03-10 12:12:03	*	half has to go through and convert some bashisms eventually ;-;
2016-03-10 12:12:49	+fyr	I should write a cron job to check for xkcd for a new comic and auto download it when a new one gets released
2016-03-10 12:14:15	sshbio	I feel better now that my flood is away.

2016-03-10 12:17:53	sshbio	Have any of you used sh shell?  on Arch, sh is a link pointing to bash.
2016-03-10 12:17:55	+fyr	maybe it's missing a compile time option...
2016-03-10 12:17:58	boobah	fyr: i'll write one, brb
2016-03-10 12:18:08	josm	I use zsh
2016-03-10 12:18:22	+fyr	sshbio, use dash and sh it to /bin/sh
2016-03-10 12:18:26	+fyr	oh wait you can't
2016-03-10 12:18:32	+fyr	because then arch breaks

2016-03-10 12:21:09	fsociety	i use zsh mainly for its interactive element, for eg. history plugins and oh-my-zsh plugins for git etc

2016-03-10 12:33:07	sshbio	fyr: So you do not use anything else than dash?  No completion at all?
2016-03-10 12:33:14	boobah	it's a perl script
2016-03-10 12:33:21	+fyr	yeah fuck perl
2016-03-10 12:33:30	boobah	sshbio: wasn't he talking for running scripts?
2016-03-10 12:33:34	+fyr	sshbio, no I still use zsh for interactive use
2016-03-10 12:33:35	boobah	sshbio: because i do that
2016-03-10 12:33:42	+fyr	try and keep it lightweight though
2016-03-10 12:33:47	+fyr	sh only for scripting
2016-03-10 12:34:08	boobah	using dash for interactive use is, like, more minimalism than is healthy
2016-03-10 12:34:15	boobah	thank god no one here does this
2016-03-10 12:34:23	+fyr	well I would probably
2016-03-10 12:34:29	+fyr	but no vi bindings :>
2016-03-10 12:34:44	boobah	it ruins half the point of running an interactive shell. no thanks.
2016-03-10 12:34:57	boobah	mksh is stripped enough.
2016-03-10 12:35:01	sshbio	Ok, for scripting only.  This is how it should work everywhere! sh must just be some POSIX sh and that's it.  Otherwise, one would have done #!/bin/bash!
2016-03-10 12:35:09	half	Lol what
2016-03-10 12:35:11	half	Aight.

2016-03-10 13:13:54	%adam	.NET is pretty impressive
2016-03-10 13:13:58	%vypr	I agree
2016-03-10 13:14:02	%vypr	that doesn't make VS good

2016-03-10 14:24:28	greduan	yo I let a PGP key expire, although I still consider it useful. I adjusted its expire time. how do I update the key servers with the new expiration?
2016-03-10 14:24:59	greduan	I re-submitted it using this https://sks-keyservers.net/i/

2016-03-10 14:25:40	%adam	but you can let PGP servers know that you dont use a certain key
2016-03-10 14:25:49	%adam	but you have to generate a file or someshit like that
2016-03-10 14:25:56	greduan	a revocation thingy yeah
2016-03-10 14:26:08	%adam	yea
2016-03-10 14:26:09	greduan	however, I know I can update the expiration date of keys on key servers
2016-03-10 14:26:11	greduan	I've done it before
2016-03-10 14:26:13	%adam	oh
2016-03-10 14:26:15	%adam	then idk
2016-03-10 14:26:22	%adam	i didnt realize you could do that tbh
2016-03-10 14:26:23	greduan	just wondering if I still can if it already expired
2016-03-10 14:26:26	greduan	yeah you can
2016-03-10 14:26:37	greduan	otherwise every year you'd be fucked having to generate a new GPG key. lol
2016-03-10 14:26:37	%adam	i dont mess with gpg any more after i added 5 keys that i lost 2 days later to all major key servrs
2016-03-10 14:27:02	greduan	OK awesome it updated, great https://sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x99C9826C54CFDECB
2016-03-10 14:27:07	greduan	new expiration date is active

2016-03-10 14:53:30	greduan	thank you for your answer
2016-03-10 14:54:26	greduan	and now to make a password manager that I just came up with :P
2016-03-10 14:59:02	greduan	it'll encrypt a SQLite3 file with GPG, and then inside each record will also be encrypted. so you need the password to access the file AND the password to get the password.
2016-03-10 14:59:20	greduan	just so that if they manage to get the file unencrypted while it is still in memory, they can't actually read the info
2016-03-10 15:01:07	s-ol	twitter just answered
2016-03-10 15:01:44	s-ol	they say they dont do inactive account takeovers anymore, but I should request it again in a few months because they might revert the policy and allow everyone to take over an inactive account
2016-03-10 15:03:29	greduan	 that'd be so nice
2016-03-10 15:03:41	greduan	both eduan and greduan are inactive and they're both my global nicks. lol
2016-03-10 15:03:44	greduan	so I use greeduan

2016-03-10 15:12:15	%adam	81 i believe
2016-03-10 15:12:23	greduan	how does this look for usage? https://gist.github.com/greduan/be99f69ccbc34688dab6
2016-03-10 15:12:48	%adam	my oldest living relative is my grandpa who is turning 87 this year
2016-03-10 15:13:04	@fro	mine are all dead
2016-03-10 15:13:20	%adam	yea i presume that will be the case for me by the time i reach 30
2016-03-10 15:13:25	greduan	mine is... my grandpa I guess, 80s or 90s I don't remember.
2016-03-10 15:13:27	%adam	ive only lost one so far
2016-03-10 15:13:35	greduan	my grandma is 70s IIRC
2016-03-10 15:13:39	greduan	or 80s
2016-03-10 15:13:43	greduan	younger than my grandpa
2016-03-10 15:13:53	@fro	mine were all dead by the time i was 22
2016-03-10 15:13:56	greduan	both my grandparent pairs are alive
2016-03-10 15:14:12	%adam	fro: you one of the oldest in your generation?
2016-03-10 15:14:35	@fro	no
2016-03-10 15:14:46	@fro	almost the youngest
2016-03-10 15:15:16	@fro	greduan: lot of password entering
2016-03-10 15:15:36	greduan	I know, that's sorta the point
2016-03-10 15:15:59	%adam	isnt a password manager supposed to minimize entering passwords into things>
2016-03-10 15:16:00	%adam	?
2016-03-10 15:16:02	@fro	yeah but ls needing it too?
2016-03-10 15:16:19	greduan	adam: no, it minimizes remembering
2016-03-10 15:16:28	greduan	well the idea is that the file is encrypted
2016-03-10 15:16:35	greduan	and then the records themselves are encrypted
2016-03-10 15:16:37	@fro	i just use keepass
2016-03-10 15:16:52	%adam	i just let firefox do it for me and hope fro doesnt ddos me
2016-03-10 15:17:23	fsociety	greduan: your ideas sounds like pass
2016-03-10 15:17:28	fsociety	which uses gpg keys and git
2016-03-10 15:18:12	greduan	fsociety: yup. but pass is dumb and reveals to anybody all your stored passwords. not the passwords but the names for each password
2016-03-10 15:18:17	greduan	NOW YOU KNOW I'VE A PASSWORD TO FAKKU FFS
2016-03-10 15:18:23	greduan	see what I'm saying?
2016-03-10 15:18:41	fsociety	greduan: but whos going to really look at that on a desktop machine that nobody can use anyway
2016-03-10 15:18:42	fsociety	haha
2016-03-10 15:18:51	@fro	listen
2016-03-10 15:18:58	@fro	people know you have passwords to things
2016-03-10 15:19:02	@fro	that doesn't matter
2016-03-10 15:19:06	@fro	for instance

2016-03-10 15:19:13	@fro	i have a password to dotshare.it
2016-03-10 15:19:19	@fro	because i obviously posted there
2016-03-10 15:19:23	@fro	you can see my post
2016-03-10 15:19:25	@fro	same for reddit
2016-03-10 15:19:30	@fro	for nixers.net
2016-03-10 15:19:31	@fro	etc
2016-03-10 15:19:33	@fro	hell
2016-03-10 15:19:34	greduan	z3bra thinks it's stupid for people to know that you have passwords to specific websites, which is why he's not satisfied with pass
2016-03-10 15:19:40	@fro	i even have 2 passwords for irc
2016-03-10 15:19:48	@fro	well
2016-03-10 15:19:54	@fro	z3bra isn't right about everything
2016-03-10 15:20:02	%adam	oh youve done it now fro
2016-03-10 15:20:11	fsociety	i was gonna say - z3bra says its not good so it must be right
2016-03-10 15:20:12	fsociety	haha
2016-03-10 15:20:15	greduan	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2016-03-10 15:20:24	greduan	no but I agree with him on that point
2016-03-10 15:20:31	@fro	yeah
2016-03-10 15:20:32	@fro	sure
2016-03-10 15:20:42	greduan	besdies what's the harm in making another password manager? :P
2016-03-10 15:20:45	@fro	you don't go telling everyone about having accounts everywhere
2016-03-10 15:20:48	@fro	like i just did
2016-03-10 15:20:52	@fro	that's bad practice
2016-03-10 15:20:53	greduan	sorry I come from JS where everybody has their own fucking framework. lol
2016-03-10 15:20:56	@fro	but
2016-03-10 15:20:57	@fro	i don't care
2016-03-10 15:21:09	fsociety	fro: no one cares about you fro, but i love you ;)
2016-03-10 15:21:18	@fro	good
2016-03-10 15:21:26	@fro	that means no one is trying to guess my password to these things

2016-03-10 15:25:07	@fro	xterm is pledged also
2016-03-10 15:25:09	%adam	cause I know OpenBSD is a superior OS in comparison to Linux

2016-03-10 15:26:22	@fro	why
2016-03-10 15:26:40	@fro	thought you wanted to stay on lunix
2016-03-10 15:27:02	%adam	because the opensource radeon driver didnt support my monitor and kms didnt work either
2016-03-10 15:27:18	%adam	i had a 7770 then
2016-03-10 15:27:25	%adam	now i have a 6670 and everything works fine
2016-03-10 15:27:33	@fro	even on lunix?
2016-03-10 15:27:37	%adam	yea
2016-03-10 15:27:42	@fro	that's no good
2016-03-10 15:27:46	%adam	no it isnt
2016-03-10 15:28:10	%adam	but i dont need to add binary firmware when im compiling the kernel with this card either
2016-03-10 15:28:14	%adam	which is good
2016-03-10 15:28:20	%adam	because the firmware is outdated anyways
2016-03-10 15:29:08	%adam	actually i may still need to in openbsd...

2016-03-11 02:09:50	@rocx	i just do cwm since most everything i do is built in to it since cwm, y'know, manages windows.

2016-03-11 02:11:29	@rocx	i've stopped lisping now with the exception for configuring emacs.
2016-03-11 02:12:02	@rocx	if i decide to hop on the bandwagon again, it's either to clojure for big projects or racket for small.
2016-03-11 02:12:08	@rocx	until then, it's perl from here.
2016-03-11 02:13:03	@rocx	skrzyp: what theme is that?
2016-03-11 02:14:02	skrzyp	which theme?

2016-03-11 02:15:08	@rocx	though i should probably add some color to mine since a few shades of white won't really cut it.

2016-03-11 02:17:01	@rocx	skrzyp: was using moe before deciding to roll monochromatic.
2016-03-11 02:17:30	@rocx	phoenix dark mono was too dark in a lot of areas and tao changes font sizes in some modes (eg. markdown-mode).
2016-03-11 02:17:43	@rocx	instead of forking, shale was born.
2016-03-11 02:18:48	@rocx	it is a rock joke.
2016-03-11 02:18:54	%stark	that theme name implies some obscure shell or a bald 10 year old's name

2016-03-11 03:44:34	tudurom	some colorblind guy told me on /r/unixpork that he likes my color scheme. should i take it as a compliment?

2016-03-11 03:46:06	+seth	... do you guys not understand color blindness
2016-03-11 03:46:20	+seth	monochromatic color blindness is *extremely rare*
2016-03-11 03:46:38	tudurom	maybe if he wasn't colorblind he wouldn't compliment me.
2016-03-11 03:46:49	+seth	there's red-green, and blue-yellow primarily
2016-03-11 03:47:11	+seth	so either he can't really tell the difference between red/green or he can't tell the difference between blue-yellow
2016-03-11 03:47:40	+seth	but the rest of the spectrum is unaffected
2016-03-11 03:47:44	tudurom	i heard that for them red-green or blue-yellow is black
2016-03-11 03:48:00	+seth	no, it's more ambiguous to them as in it looks identical to another color
2016-03-11 03:48:08	%stark	greduan, That was a joke relating to a similar comment in one of the askreddit threads

2016-03-11 03:48:53	greduan	oh ok
2016-03-11 03:49:07	tudurom	fyr: that's pure coincidence
2016-03-11 03:49:14	+fyr	uh
2016-03-11 03:49:55	tudurom	the colors are made by me by taking the hue of a color from a default wallpaper from Xubuntu
2016-03-11 03:50:11	tudurom	s/hue/saturation/
2016-03-11 03:50:48	+fyr	well the colors are different for sure
2016-03-11 03:50:59	+fyr	there's just something about your scrots that seems generic to me
2016-03-11 03:51:01	+fyr	I dunno why

2016-03-11 03:59:37	sshbio	fyr: I installed all required dependencies, and cloned github's fyre, edited the PREFIX in the makefile, and then ran `make`.  It complained about missing scripts in the repo (wgroups.sh, sxhkdc.example, hover.sh)
2016-03-11 04:00:02	+fyr	ah okay let me update
2016-03-11 04:00:24	sshbio	I removed these lines from the makefile, and it installed.  Thank you!
2016-03-11 04:03:19	+fyr	okay just remember to run make again when you pull

2016-03-11 04:15:09	+fyr	sshbio, just do exec runfyre.sh along with sxhkd and anything else you want to start on X server launch
2016-03-11 04:15:26	+fyr	it's very much tweaked to me atm
2016-03-11 04:15:57	+fyr	I'd recommend to syslink the scripts to somewhere on your $PATH and then make any changes you want
2016-03-11 04:16:04	+fyr	rather than use the makefile

2016-03-11 04:18:20	sshbio	fyr: I have seen by myself in this channel that it was heavyly tweaked by now, so np!  This was mostly to find an implementation example of wmutils, and have something to try before dropping dwm.
2016-03-11 04:18:42	+fyr	sshbio, dunno why you're getting that error
2016-03-11 04:18:54	+fyr	$SCREENS should be defined in fyrerc.sh
2016-03-11 04:18:58	+fyr	which gets sourced
2016-03-11 04:19:25	sshbio	ACTION is checking again...
2016-03-11 04:21:54	+fyr	??
2016-03-11 04:23:42	sshbio	You said that was being very much tweaked atm, but I was aware of it so no problem about that. :)
2016-03-11 04:27:31	greduan	anybody tried the Vivaldi browser yet?
2016-03-11 04:27:47	greduan	I am so fucking interested in it, but the goddamn closed source jibbies my jibbies.
2016-03-11 04:28:01	greduan	not because I'm worried
2016-03-11 04:28:07	greduan	but just because it's closed source. lol
2016-03-11 04:28:41	sshbio	greduan: Yes, the closed sources made me choosing other project.
2016-03-11 04:29:49	+fyr	the jimmies were rustled
2016-03-11 04:35:18	greduan	those were the words I was looking for. thank you.
2016-03-11 04:40:12	+fyr	hey xero what have you done so far for your multiple monitor situation?
2016-03-11 04:41:00	@xero	fyr: honestly, my script is very similar lazr's https://github.com/laserswald/backflip
2016-03-11 04:41:13	+fyr	ugh
2016-03-11 04:41:24	+fyr	think I got my own idea for it
2016-03-11 04:41:24	@xero	he made ls_disp, current_disp, and geo_disp
2016-03-11 04:41:34	@xero	mine is all one script that does 
2016-03-11 04:42:20	+fyr	well I think I am gonna parse xrandr out put so on each line it'll be $SCREEN $X $Y $W $H
2016-03-11 04:42:32	+fyr	then let the scripts themshelves parse that
2016-03-11 04:43:04	@xero	i like to teleport windows to displays
2016-03-11 04:43:23	@xero	so i often just need the cords of screenX 
2016-03-11 04:43:35	+fyr	hmm
2016-03-11 04:44:12	+fyr	I'd like it so you can pass a screenvar to a script (or if none, operate on the current screen)
2016-03-11 04:47:12	@xero	i calc "current screen" on the focus even and store it
2016-03-11 04:47:20	@xero	then my scripts used the stored value
2016-03-11 04:49:57	+fyr	that's probably alot simplier but would annoy me :/
2016-03-11 04:50:41	@xero	most of my scripts rely on /tmp/wmutils

2016-03-11 06:03:19	L8D	thanks
2016-03-11 06:04:04	L8D	someone should combine urnn with base16-builder
2016-03-11 06:04:10	+fyr	L8D, why would you use a default mac wallpaper
2016-03-11 06:04:19	L8D	fyr: reasons
2016-03-11 06:05:03	L8D	it's because I'm an insecure teenager who cares about his coworker's opinions and if I chose a wallpaper then that means I care about what wallpaper I have
2016-03-11 06:05:18	L8D	so if I keep the default yosemite wallpaper it means I don't care about my wallpaper
2016-03-11 06:05:30	@xero	use a solid color then
2016-03-11 06:05:31	L8D	but secretly I do so I wanna rice up my color scheme to make it look good
2016-03-11 06:05:38	@xero	#222222 crew

2016-03-11 07:35:45	tudurom	and it's not compiled
2016-03-11 07:36:08	@xero	you *can* compile php
2016-03-11 07:36:17	tudurom	holy smokes!
2016-03-11 07:37:01	dcat	yeah
2016-03-11 07:37:08	dcat	but then you have to give stallman a rimjob
2016-03-11 07:37:10	@xero	phalanger, phc, bcompiler, binaryPHP, and hacklang to name a few
2016-03-11 07:37:22	tudurom	php7 looks a bit like node destroyer
2016-03-11 07:37:32	@xero	dcat: his asshole tastes like freedome
2016-03-11 07:37:55	dcat	really?
2016-03-11 07:38:03	dcat	I didn't know african cum tasted like freedom
2016-03-11 07:38:11	tudurom	>tfw i didn't know what rimjob is and i search it on wikipedia. article complete with image
2016-03-11 07:38:15	dcat	considering africans history, that seems very unlikely
2016-03-11 07:38:20	L8D	tudurom: node stroyer?
2016-03-11 07:38:30	tudurom	nodejs
2016-03-11 07:38:30	L8D	destoryer*
2016-03-11 07:38:32	@xero	dcat: dont knock it until you try it
2016-03-11 07:38:33	tudurom	all the hype
2016-03-11 07:38:44	*	xero cant even type this shit w/ a strate face
2016-03-11 07:38:45	L8D	tudurom: I doubt php7 will have anything on nodejs
2016-03-11 07:39:01	@xero	L8D: i completely disagree
2016-03-11 07:39:16	@xero	php-fpm is already orders of magnatude faster than node
2016-03-11 07:39:29	L8D	ok that doesn't mean anyone will want to use it
2016-03-11 07:39:35	L8D	people don't use node because node is fast or anything
2016-03-11 07:39:40	greduan	watching the first Google DeepMind challenge ATM
2016-03-11 07:39:41	@xero	the centeralized server nature of node is it's biggest weakeness imo
2016-03-11 07:39:41	tudurom	while the normal php took 0.01 seconds to display hello world
2016-03-11 07:39:43	greduan	very interesting
2016-03-11 07:39:46	L8D	people use node becasue node is JavaScript and they like JavaScript or they know JavaScript
2016-03-11 07:39:54	L8D	or they want to keep everything in JavaScript
2016-03-11 07:40:04	tudurom	javascript on node should be called NodeScript
2016-03-11 07:40:12	L8D	if you only use node for performance then you're an idiot unless you're just trying to be economic
2016-03-11 07:40:12	half	Fucking Youtube. I'm listening to a death metal playlist, what in the fuck (which includes my history) makes it logical to serve me a fucking Hip Hop album add?
2016-03-11 07:40:31	@xero	half: better than a christian rock one i guess
2016-03-11 07:40:36	L8D	half: because donuts came out 10 years ago this mont
2016-03-11 07:40:42	half	No they didn't.
2016-03-11 07:40:43	greduan	tudurom: it's JS though, Node is just a runner of JS that is in the OS instead of the browser. lol
2016-03-11 07:40:49	dcat	xero: nothing is better than christian *
2016-03-11 07:40:51	half	L8D: You're a liar, I need you to not be.
2016-03-11 07:40:58	@xero	dcat pls
2016-03-11 07:40:59	greduan	so NodeScript is not accurate
2016-03-11 07:41:04	L8D	half: what am I lying about?
2016-03-11 07:41:06	@xero	are you like the only christian in all of norway?

2016-03-11 07:43:45	dcat	are you seriosly disregarding a good song purely because it's christian themed?

2016-03-11 07:43:58	@xero	that song was really bad on it own

2016-03-11 07:48:48	@xero	L8D: we know what's good?
2016-03-11 07:48:57	@rocx	can i say i hate spacemacs now because /r/unixporn is starting to have a lot of "laoul i uze the emax itz kuul naough"?
2016-03-11 07:49:07	@xero	unix beards are badge of honor
2016-03-11 07:49:12	half	xero: Actually, i take that back. I had one friend who was quite the fan

2016-03-11 07:49:41	@rocx	dcat: which one of arc's scrots?
2016-03-11 07:49:51	half	L8D: The more you understand the underlying systems of this world, the more you need something that shouts from the guts of hell to process the emotions you start to feel.
2016-03-11 07:49:56	L8D	rocx: totally. I mean if someone is using emacs because they think it's cool then it's totally justified to hate on them for it
2016-03-11 07:49:59	dcat	http://pub.iotek.org/p/0fURLx6.png
2016-03-11 07:50:13	@rocx	oh that old one.

2016-03-11 07:50:55	dcat	xero: I didn't even notice
2016-03-11 07:51:11	@rocx	L8D: it's like the moment someone made a vim-like default config for it (with a bunch of evil-mode addons), everyone ate it up and disregarded the editor wars that they were supposed to continue until MS made alternative operating systems illegal.
2016-03-11 07:51:19	@xero	ignore me. i'm a P.O.S. today
2016-03-11 07:51:21	dcat	I'm gonna be kind of pissed if that wallpaper is not my xbm port
2016-03-11 07:51:56	L8D	rocx: I mean I think a ton of people defended emacs by saying "you can have emacs in vim" but no one *really* did that and they kept using vim (I was one of those people)
2016-03-11 07:52:17	L8D	rocx: and now that spacemacs is here they have the low-barrier opportunity to try it out
2016-03-11 07:52:19	@rocx	i just use evil-mode because vi bindings NEVER leave you once you know them.
2016-03-11 07:52:35	@xero	dcat: that's a tile from squid fingers w/ a color overlay http://pub.iotek.org/p/28SxGmy.png
2016-03-11 07:53:03	@rocx	L8D: it's low-barrier alright. it was my first real foray into using emacs.
2016-03-11 07:53:03	dcat	xero: https://gist.github.com/dcat/896ff92229de70e4e5ca
2016-03-11 07:53:07	@rocx	i will advise against it strongly.
2016-03-11 07:53:21	L8D	I just use neovim because I like not having to wait 15 seconds for my editor to startup, and I don't want to maintain a daemon system or a complicated configuration
2016-03-11 07:53:32	@rocx	you use emacs to BEND IT TO YOUR VERY WILL, not to use what someone else bent it over into.
2016-03-11 07:54:00	L8D	rocx: very true

2016-03-11 07:55:05	@rocx	neat.
2016-03-11 07:55:06	@xero	i was gonna say, how do you brick a table
2016-03-11 07:55:12	L8D	> 2016
2016-03-11 07:55:16	@rocx	xero: by dropping a big brick on it.
2016-03-11 07:55:27	%adam	and id adb sideload
2016-03-11 07:55:31	@xero	rocx: that doesnt sound "soft" to me
2016-03-11 07:55:35	%adam	but my os isnt recognizing the device
2016-03-11 07:55:48	@rocx	L8D: tablets are unfortunately the next generation of computing. it's just waiting for desktops to die.
2016-03-11 07:55:53	@rocx	xero: it's a chalk brick.
2016-03-11 07:55:56	half	Neovim, Vim, and Emacs all reinvent the wheel quite a lot. 
2016-03-11 07:56:09	%adam	yeah were not calling it computer science anymore were calling it tablet science

2016-03-11 07:56:56	L8D	neovim = vim in almost all cases
2016-03-11 07:57:06	half	I was thinking like, Sandy
2016-03-11 07:57:07	L8D	it's just cooler to say "I use neovim" than to say "I use vim"

2016-03-11 07:59:41	@rocx	the only finger that gets pinkeyed is the shift key.

2016-03-11 08:07:45	L8D	someone would say :wq and then the other person would say :x it's shorter and then another person would say ZZ it's even shorter and then they'd be like "what?" and then the other person would say "because the shift key"

2016-03-11 09:33:02	arc	why would i use it?
2016-03-11 09:33:56	half	Eh, you can pass off things to other programs easily, and it has indentation + syntax highlighting, some modality
2016-03-11 09:34:16	half	So basicaly it gets you a very barebones editor that you can script til your heart is content

2016-03-11 09:36:56	+fyr	but seeing as sloppy focus is properly implemented for wew now
2016-03-11 09:37:19	@xero	half: have you tried vis yet?

2016-03-11 09:40:35	arc	why vis over vim
2016-03-11 09:40:52	half	Most of the function, in a fraction of the code
2016-03-11 09:41:06	arc	oo
2016-03-11 09:41:14	half	2366 for sandy
2016-03-11 09:43:21	half	I just feel like a text editor is about as useful for running things as a browser. It's convenience at the expense of overhead and capibility

2016-03-11 09:46:04	half	arc: Yeah. But I mean running things plugged in to a browser is overhead, and doesn't generally cater to a specific use case - I'm finding the same conclusions about editors

2016-03-11 17:19:53	boobah	looks good though, i like the idea.
2016-03-11 17:20:06	*	boobah often wishes he used emacs.
2016-03-11 17:20:23	half	I'm not a fan really, mostly due to chording and configurations
2016-03-11 17:20:44	boobah	you can set it up however you want. hell, look at evil-mode and the spacemacs meta package
2016-03-11 17:21:03	boobah	and configuration is weird but also the key to its power
2016-03-11 17:21:14	half	Yeah. It's just not for me
2016-03-11 17:21:18	boobah	same
2016-03-11 17:21:31	half	Too much, too damn much.
2016-03-11 17:21:41	boobah	i would've switched years ago, but this is indeed the problem for me too
2016-03-11 17:21:49	boobah	i don't believe in using lisp for a text editor, either
2016-03-11 17:21:56	half	Use the correct tool for the job, not just a bunch of tools slapped on to a one-fits-all thing
2016-03-11 17:22:00	boobah	yep
2016-03-11 17:22:20	boobah	i hope r.o.c.x doesn't hear this :P
2016-03-11 17:22:24	half	That being said, I haven't found the time to mess with sandy and such
2016-03-11 17:22:33	half	We had this conversation earlier :p
2016-03-11 17:22:35	boobah	i've only used sandy once, years ago
2016-03-11 17:22:46	half	After I divulged my disdain for dotfiles :p
2016-03-11 17:22:53	boobah	haha
2016-03-11 17:23:03	boobah	just wrote a dotfile manager yesterday
2016-03-11 17:23:08	boobah	can't wait to start using it
2016-03-11 17:23:16	half	I get that it's pedantic, things are just much easier when each thing is in a specific directory meant for settings and files of that type
2016-03-11 17:23:39	boobah	i patch all my programs to use a central ~/.config directory
2016-03-11 17:23:49	half	They all disowned me, because I have only one dotfile in my ~/
2016-03-11 17:23:55	half	(.ssh)
2016-03-11 17:24:08	half	build
2016-03-11 17:24:10	half	local
2016-03-11 17:24:12	half	media
2016-03-11 17:24:14	half	programming
2016-03-11 17:24:16	half	run
2016-03-11 17:24:21	boobah	i hate that every program thinks it's important enough to have its own ~/.w3m or ~/.vim or whatever bullshit
2016-03-11 17:24:29	half	Yeah. that's irksome. 
2016-03-11 17:24:32	boobah	that's pretty impressive actually
2016-03-11 17:24:36	boobah	i thought mine was clean
2016-03-11 17:24:46	boobah	where's your shell stuff? /etc/profile?
2016-03-11 17:24:46	half	Actually, xero's zsh files are broken out amazingly well
2016-03-11 17:25:05	half	Sorta. 
2016-03-11 17:25:22	half	I have `ZDOTDIR=~/local/cfg/zsh` in my /etc/zsh/zshenv
2016-03-11 17:25:31	boobah	ahhh
2016-03-11 17:25:56	half	But you just gave me a great idea, heh.
2016-03-11 17:26:07	boobah	wait, and you must also have .Xauthority, .cache, .dbus (if you use it), .gtkrc, .xinitrc too right?
2016-03-11 17:26:08	half	~/local/profile.d/
2016-03-11 17:26:14	boobah	do it
2016-03-11 17:26:23	half	No, no, no, no, no. 
2016-03-11 17:26:35	boobah	what ,how? i've been wanting to get rid of these
2016-03-11 17:26:41	boobah	well, at least move them
2016-03-11 17:26:47	half	There's a workaround for the first, second (save for pulseaudio), 4th, and 5th
2016-03-11 17:27:05	half	See uh https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support
2016-03-11 17:27:10	half	Should be comprehensive.
2016-03-11 17:27:21	boobah	oh, didn't realize XDG covered that stuff. neat, i'll check it out.
2016-03-11 17:27:29	boobah	also...
2016-03-11 17:27:54	half	Yeeh.
2016-03-11 17:28:00	half	Kinda screwed if you don't use XDG
2016-03-11 17:28:10	half	Means to an end.
2016-03-11 17:28:14	boobah	$ ls ~/.config
2016-03-11 17:28:17	boobah	gtk-2.0  pulse
2016-03-11 17:28:19	boobah	# fuck
2016-03-11 17:28:32	half	Hehe
2016-03-11 17:28:46	boobah	that annoys me to no end.
2016-03-11 17:29:08	boobah	i've been getting along without any custom XDG stuff for years, but this should help
2016-03-11 17:29:41	half	I've been looking for an agnostic way, between interactive shells/init systems/graphical servers to have my environment variables set up
2016-03-11 17:30:10	boobah	the whole thing needs to be scrapped, and redone with more simplicity in mind
2016-03-11 17:30:19	half	Yeah.
2016-03-11 17:30:30	boobah	"the whole thing" being the primary components of a desktop linux 
2016-03-11 17:30:33	boobah	system
2016-03-11 17:30:34	half	I rather like how z3bra had his $distro laid out, iirc
2016-03-11 17:30:57	boobah	yes, it's based on the morpheus/stali ideas, right?
2016-03-11 17:31:04	half	Yeah
2016-03-11 17:31:09	boobah	me gusta
2016-03-11 17:31:15	half	Mhm. If you gopher, it's in his
2016-03-11 17:31:22	half	gopher://z3bra.org
2016-03-11 17:31:25	boobah	i do gopher indeed
2016-03-11 17:31:27	boobah	o
2016-03-11 17:31:29	boobah	i'll look
2016-03-11 17:31:34	boobah	disregard the 'p'
2016-03-11 17:31:39	boobah	disregard the 'o', i mean
2016-03-11 17:31:43	boobah	jesus, i have butterfingers
2016-03-11 17:32:01	half	Lol :)
2016-03-11 17:32:06	half	What do you use for gophering?
2016-03-11 17:34:26	boobah	cgo, it's pretty basic but i've never tried anything else
2016-03-11 17:34:54	boobah	i tried installing the overbite plugin for chrome once, but it didn't work right away so i kinda gave up on that
2016-03-11 17:36:06	boobah	btw, gopher://z3bra.org/distro/journal begins with '# nopelinux' ... did he finally name it, or is this old (before the "$distro" placeholder)?
2016-03-11 17:44:47	half	I think it's old
2016-03-11 17:45:07	half	Anyways, I was thinking of a cgo like interface for gits
2016-03-11 17:45:32	half	Since I don't like github, not gitlab
2016-03-11 17:46:23	half	s/not/nor/me/
2016-03-11 17:46:23	regx	<half> Since I don't like github, nor gitlab
2016-03-11 17:46:34	half	Meant or, haha
2016-03-11 17:46:41	boobah	interesting
2016-03-11 17:46:58	boobah	"Since I like neither github nor gitlab" if u wanna be a grammar nazi
2016-03-11 17:47:15	half	Yeah.
2016-03-11 17:47:26	boobah	no one talks like that though; it sounds odd
2016-03-11 17:47:36	half	Somewhat
2016-03-11 17:47:52	half	Depends on the inflections I think
2016-03-11 17:48:07	half	You can sound fucking pompous with that phrase
2016-03-11 17:48:49	boobah	lol, indeed
2016-03-11 18:22:57	@zn42	boobah, still no name
2016-03-11 18:23:29	boobah	ugh, lame
2016-03-11 18:24:00	boobah	although i'm just sitting on my ass, so i've no room to speak :P
2016-03-11 18:28:35	@zn42	why is it lame?
2016-03-11 18:28:48	@zn42	is it bad to not have a name for something that doesn't work yet?
2016-03-11 18:28:57	boobah	no
2016-03-11 18:29:09	boobah	i want it to exist
2016-03-11 18:29:12	boobah	takes time, though
2016-03-11 18:29:20	@zn42	yes
2016-03-11 18:29:21	boobah	i'm half joking anyway, lighten up
2016-03-11 18:29:38	@zn42	*half*
2016-03-11 18:30:20	boobah	why do you care so much? i'm just following his progress as it moves along.
2016-03-11 18:31:21	@zn42	thanks
2016-03-11 18:38:08	@zn42	I'm onto something else atm anyway
2016-03-11 18:38:22	@zn42	so the distro has been put to the background for a bit
2016-03-11 18:39:53	boobah	haha, hi z3bra
2016-03-11 18:40:06	@zn42	ah, yeah

2016-03-11 18:41:02	boobah	no, i meant your nick
2016-03-11 18:41:04	@zn42	I purchased a server online, installed my first openbsd on it
2016-03-11 18:41:16	@zn42	that's what I'm doing, cna't you listen? :)
2016-03-11 18:41:23	boobah	how do you like obsd so far?
2016-03-11 18:41:37	@zn42	it's weeldesigned
2016-03-11 18:41:40	@zn42	well
2016-03-11 18:42:03	@zn42	and I'm using this box to play around with networking

2016-03-11 18:43:54	@zn42	yeah I should 
2016-03-11 18:44:01	@zn42	my blog has been dead for a while now

2016-03-11 18:45:06	%stark	take your time, to write it in details :)
2016-03-11 18:45:15	%stark	You have moved from crux ?

2016-03-11 18:45:32	@zn42	maybe more
2016-03-11 18:46:35	@zn42	so yeah I'm doing this for myself
2016-03-11 18:46:49	@zn42	asking a few friends to join me over this
2016-03-11 18:47:12	%stark	I personally didn't try it out simply because lack of hardware, more of interested in learning netand unix sys administration

2016-03-12 16:14:39	@rocx	adam: you should play with greduan then.
2016-03-12 16:14:45	%adam	he probably bought it
2016-03-12 16:15:13	greduan	I only got CSGO
2016-03-12 16:15:22	%adam	csgo is for losers
2016-03-12 16:15:25	@fro	what's the difference
2016-03-12 16:15:42	%adam	cs source is better because cs source has jailbreak
2016-03-12 16:16:02	@rocx	aaaah. good ol' days playing on a source game.
2016-03-12 16:16:30	*	rocx flashes back to the days as the engineer who defended the base pretty well until a heavy, a medic, and a spy walk into the bar.
2016-03-12 16:16:42	%adam	bar?
2016-03-12 16:16:45	%adam	I HARDLY KNOW HER!
2016-03-12 16:17:10	*	rocx recalls the medic was ready for an ubercharge, the spy had that napoleon-style coat and hat and a dead ringer, and the heavy had a renamed "Brass Breast".
2016-03-12 16:17:13	greduan	CS 1.6 are the golden days of the skill ceiling. CS Source is worse but still good and CSGO is just a bad game compared to CS 1.6
2016-03-12 16:17:16	greduan	AFAIK
2016-03-12 16:17:22	%adam	afaik
2016-03-12 16:17:22	%adam	no
2016-03-12 16:17:25	%adam	cs source is the best
2016-03-12 16:17:28	*	rocx failed to protect the base because no one would help him.

2016-03-12 16:17:49	@rocx	it is now.
2016-03-12 16:17:54	%adam	its only lame if u use the awp
2016-03-12 16:18:07	@fro	should play a real man's game
2016-03-12 16:18:08	@rocx	greduan: i was pretty good at 1.6.
2016-03-12 16:18:12	@fro	like tetrinet
2016-03-12 16:18:14	@rocx	even for one who mainly played openarena.
2016-03-12 16:18:17	greduan	Everybod refers to CS 1.6 as the best and CS Source being a disappointment.

2016-03-12 16:22:03	boobah	why the hell is weechat so out-of-date in the ubuntu 14 repos
2016-03-12 16:22:12	half	Because you use Ubuntu
2016-03-12 16:22:23	boobah	$ weechat -v

2016-03-12 16:22:55	boobah	fro: is that how the repos work? i don't know anything about *ubuntu
2016-03-12 16:23:04	@fro	pretty sure
2016-03-12 16:23:13	@fro	is that an LTS version
2016-03-12 16:23:15	boobah	yeah
2016-03-12 16:23:24	boobah	i guess that explains it
2016-03-12 16:23:28	@fro	you won't see updated packages then
2016-03-12 16:23:35	@fro	only security/stability stuff
2016-03-12 16:23:50	boobah	should probably build latest from source on here, then
2016-03-12 16:23:58	%adam	were also forgetting the fact that ubuntu is a shitty distro
2016-03-12 16:24:27	boobah	it's on my shared server, so i think we're keeping with it for now
2016-03-12 16:24:40	@fro	could install from a PPA probably

2016-03-12 16:25:49	boobah	i should
2016-03-12 16:25:56	@rocx	see if you could convince your security guy to fly with that.
2016-03-12 16:25:56	%adam	WELL
2016-03-12 16:25:58	half	Heh. Fixes happen upstream more often than they happen with patches 
2016-03-12 16:26:01	@fro	i wouldn't let you install from source if i were in charge of security either
2016-03-12 16:26:13	boobah	i have root access fro

2016-03-12 16:27:14	@fro	fuck that guy
2016-03-12 16:27:17	@fro	i don't trust him
2016-03-12 16:27:37	boobah	but this isn't for anything mission-critical, so a couple people have root, including myself

2016-03-12 16:29:25	@rocx	just that i need to.

2016-03-12 16:29:43	boobah	that doesn't work
2016-03-12 16:29:47	@rocx	it's screwy.
2016-03-12 16:29:50	boobah	s/g'night rocx//me/
2016-03-12 16:29:50	regx	<boobah> that doesn't work
2016-03-12 16:29:56	boobah	oh shit, i give up
2016-03-12 16:30:02	@rocx	and it only works on the last thing you sed.
2016-03-12 16:30:04	boobah	yeah
2016-03-12 16:30:08	@rocx	s/ed/aid//
2016-03-12 16:30:09	regx	<rocx> and it only works on the last thing you said.
2016-03-12 16:30:09	%adam	sed
2016-03-12 16:30:42	boobah	and it only works on the last(1) thing you sed(1)
2016-03-12 16:31:01	@rocx	s/s|d/b&d//
2016-03-12 16:31:02	regx	<rocx> and it only works on the last thing you sed.
2016-03-12 16:31:17	boobah	welp
2016-03-12 16:31:19	@rocx	oh screw it i'm done playing with regx. ya'll have fun with him.
2016-03-12 16:31:31	boobah	is any actual regex supported?
2016-03-12 16:31:50	@rocx	don't know why it wouldn't. it plugs straight into a subst() function.
2016-03-12 16:32:01	boobah	hmm
2016-03-12 16:32:18	boobah	i think you mean a (subst) function
2016-03-12 16:32:21	boobah	lisp boy :^)
2016-03-12 16:32:26	@rocx	let's test this out. bed bad bath.
2016-03-12 16:32:40	@rocx	s/b.d/HA!//
2016-03-12 16:32:40	regx	<rocx> let's test this out. bed bad bath.
2016-03-12 16:32:44	@rocx	oh for fu-
2016-03-12 16:32:48	@rocx	boobah: ditched lisp.
2016-03-12 16:32:55	boobah	really?
2016-03-12 16:33:05	@rocx	trying to get regx to work in common lisp broke me. now i'll only do it for emacs.
2016-03-12 16:33:10	@rocx	try /whois regx
2016-03-12 16:33:22	boobah	oh my god, you didn't
2016-03-12 16:33:37	boobah	i suppose it's appropriate though
2016-03-12 16:33:38	*	rocx nods.
2016-03-12 16:34:24	@rocx	and the sixth one to boot.
2016-03-12 16:34:27	 < 	sdothum (sdothum@Clk-75500E51.tor.primus.ca) has quit (ZNC - 1.6.0 - http://znc.in)
2016-03-12 16:34:34	@rocx	i'm sort of impressed at some of the changes.
2016-03-12 16:34:44	@rocx	single-command if blocks especially
2016-03-12 16:35:31	@rocx	you could do C-style ``if (2 > 1) { $value = 3; }''
2016-03-12 16:35:49	@rocx	or this weird new style ``$value = 3 if 2 > 1;''
2016-03-12 16:36:06	boobah	i actually don't know any perl, but that sounds odd
2016-03-12 16:36:19	@rocx	the latter will only work on single commands, like how you can omit braces in C-like syntaxes.
2016-03-12 16:36:36	boobah	gotcha
2016-03-12 16:36:57	boobah	what's the last "good version" of perl or whatever? is it pre-5?
2016-03-12 16:36:58	@rocx	not a bad idea. once regx is a little more polished, i'll publish him.
2016-03-12 16:37:07	@rocx	boobah: the last version was Perl 5.
2016-03-12 16:37:18	@rocx	Perl 6 finally released Christmas last year.
2016-03-12 16:37:24	@rocx	you know how long people waited for P6?
2016-03-12 16:37:38	boobah	pretty long, i would imagine.
2016-03-12 16:37:45	@rocx	i came across posts about t he feasibility of P6 on forums dating back to 2002.
2016-03-12 16:37:54	boobah	!
2016-03-12 16:37:55	@rocx	maybe even earlier.
2016-03-12 16:37:56	boobah	wow
2016-03-12 16:38:05	@rocx	i don't remember but it was at LEAST a decade
2016-03-12 16:38:24	boobah	i want to play with perl 5
2016-03-12 16:38:28	@rocx	boobah: don't.
2016-03-12 16:38:32	@rocx	just go with perl 6.
2016-03-12 16:38:35	@rocx	it's the future of perl.
2016-03-12 16:38:46	boobah	b-but most systems still have perl 5 installed
2016-03-12 16:38:55	@rocx	even though perl doesn't have much of a future with the likes of python's kitchen sink stdlib.
2016-03-12 16:39:27	half	Shoulda seen the breakages I had!
2016-03-12 16:39:29	@rocx	hopefully P5 won't be python2.
2016-03-12 16:39:48	@rocx	where everyone's still using it ten years after the newest version came out.
2016-03-12 16:39:58	boobah	i just know i like perl-style regex.
2016-03-12 16:40:06	@rocx	boobah: OH, that reminds me.
2016-03-12 16:40:13	@rocx	the {x,y} quantifier isn't valid in P6.
2016-03-12 16:40:17	@rocx	you use x**y
2016-03-12 16:41:36	boobah	wait, i don't think i've seen that before
2016-03-12 16:41:39	boobah	what does that do?
2016-03-12 16:41:55	boobah	x**y looks like "raise x to power y" but i doubt that's what you're talking about here
2016-03-12 16:41:59	@rocx	https://doc.perl6.org/language/regexes#General_quantifier%3A_**_min..max
2016-03-12 16:42:22	@rocx	yeah i had it wrong.
2016-03-12 16:42:30	@rocx	** x..y
2016-03-12 16:42:37	boobah	oh shit, that thing
2016-03-12 16:42:40	@rocx	** x also works.
2016-03-12 16:42:42	boobah	that's...radical
2016-03-12 16:43:14	@rocx	frankly, i decided that i shouldn't be taking on big projects and just do things to solve my problems.
2016-03-12 16:43:29	boobah	know any awk?
2016-03-12 16:43:45	half	Yeha
2016-03-12 16:44:04	@rocx	used to do a lot of AWK back in my terminal jockey days.
2016-03-12 16:44:09	boobah	worth learning? seems like a cool addition to my sed skills
2016-03-12 16:44:18	half	Yes
2016-03-12 16:44:31	half	It's handy, and in ways not directly achievable with sed
2016-03-12 16:44:33	@rocx	it's a great way to make filters in your pipes.
2016-03-12 16:44:36	half	consider -
2016-03-12 16:44:49	@rocx	think you can do BEGIN { ... } blocks in perl too.
2016-03-12 16:44:57	boobah	i want to be able to make things that aren't just linear line-by-line things
2016-03-12 16:45:05	boobah	like full parsers
2016-03-12 16:45:14	boobah	without having to crank it out in C, which takes me a while
2016-03-12 16:45:15	@rocx	perl 6 will be your bet.
2016-03-12 16:45:18	half	wtp $(wattr xywh `lsw -r` | awk '{print $1 + 8, $2 + 8, $3 - 16, $4 - 36}') $1
2016-03-12 16:45:31	boobah	rocx: i will play with it
2016-03-12 16:45:33	@rocx	https://doc.perl6.org/language/grammars
2016-03-12 16:45:47	half	(Padding for fullscreen, in a one liner!)
2016-03-12 16:45:53	@rocx	grammars are a new feature.
2016-03-12 16:46:03	boobah	half: yeah, you mentioned something like that the other day, that's what got me thinking about awk actually
2016-03-12 16:46:24	half	So handy in pipelines
2016-03-12 16:46:30	@rocx	and with that, off to bed for real.
2016-03-12 16:46:40	half	But it's also handy for slightly larger things a sewll
2016-03-12 16:46:43	half	as well *
2016-03-12 16:47:03	boobah	night rocx!
2016-03-12 16:47:54	half	I'm sorry i can't recommend any literature though.

2016-03-13 11:45:09	arc	there's not much of a reason to use screen over tmux

2016-03-13 11:45:43	arc	i use externalpipe, clipboard, and a few things copied from dcat's fork
2016-03-13 11:45:54	arc	but seriously lennox 
2016-03-13 11:45:57	arc	why screen over tmux
2016-03-13 11:46:35	boobah	i have a friend who uses screen because he's had the same config for literally 15 years
2016-03-13 11:47:20	+fyr	I mean other than pain for switching or using a machine where backwards compatability is an issue
2016-03-13 11:47:30	+fyr	or you have some run scripts that use screen
2016-03-13 11:47:59	boobah	i'm guessing he just feels too busy to migrate the configuration

2016-03-15 03:40:17	greduan	I bought a couple 32GB USBs, I'll get them on Wednesday. AND I'LL HAVE LINUX ON OS X :D

2016-03-15 03:40:30	greduan	God I'm a genius. lol
2016-03-15 03:41:40	greduan	I'll let you know how it goes
2016-03-15 03:42:01	greduan	Cause apparently to be able to boot from the USB you gotta format it correctly so that the OS X bootloader can figure it out
2016-03-15 03:42:27	greduan	In conjuction with that, I also have to figure out how to make a bootable USB that is not read-only and that is Arch Linux
2016-03-15 03:42:43	therue	i really like terminus, gohu, tewi, tamzen type fonts..don't know why, but all the popular programming fonts, the ones that have thicker lines, i get kind of dizzy just looking at them :D

2016-03-15 04:18:09	tudurom	?
2016-03-15 04:18:33	@xero	tudurom: not released *yet*
2016-03-15 04:18:52	tudurom	is it a figlet font or a normal font?
2016-03-15 04:18:55	@xero	fonts art is done, i just need to make them into actual figlet/toilet fonts

2016-03-15 04:20:51	therue	where can i learn how to make ascii art too! :D
2016-03-15 04:21:16	tudurom	learn vim
2016-03-15 04:21:33	+fyr	bloody or get the fuck out
2016-03-15 04:21:48	neeawerk	b-bloody?
2016-03-15 04:21:51	tudurom	and i think you can make ascii art with systemd too
2016-03-15 04:21:57	therue	i am learning vim at the moment actually :D
2016-03-15 04:22:07	therue	but just the basics
2016-03-15 04:22:24	@xero	your editor makes no diff in making ascii art
2016-03-15 04:22:36	tudurom	it's not that hard. it's like a simple and primitive language
2016-03-15 04:23:48	hyporhiz	xero: The only way I cannot seem to get your lightline script to stick. The only way I can see it is using "source %" in the .vimrc file, but it reverts beack to the default as soon as I exit.
2016-03-15 04:24:18	tudurom	i think you need the theme
2016-03-15 04:24:19	@xero	new font preview as requested: http://pub.iotek.org/p/rIJUnM5.png

2016-03-15 04:26:12	tudurom	the letters look like they're about to burn
2016-03-15 04:28:50	greduan	TFW you push a commit named 'FUCKING DON'T PUSH THIS SHIT THIS IS WIP' that you yourself wrote ;-;
2016-03-15 04:29:12	+fyr	>not using branches for features
2016-03-15 04:29:21	greduan	it is a branch
2016-03-15 04:29:33	greduan	but I wasn't supposed to push that cause I wanted to treat it more like a stash
2016-03-15 04:29:33	*	rocx quickly creates a branch just to keep fyr from blowing up in his face.
2016-03-15 04:29:45	+fyr	well
2016-03-15 04:29:47	+fyr	yes
2016-03-15 04:30:11	+fyr	script an push function that stops you from pushing if you set a flag :)
2016-03-15 04:30:30	tudurom	pre commit hooks?
2016-03-15 04:30:42	+fyr	pre-push to be exact
2016-03-15 04:31:00	@xero	fyr: that wouldnt have stopped him
2016-03-15 04:31:08	@xero	unless you can ONLY push w/ a flag
2016-03-15 04:31:45	tudurom	after the push got rejected, you will need to git-reset
2016-03-15 04:31:46	@xero	which would become habitual and end up negating itself in the end
2016-03-15 04:31:53	+fyr	well I only mean as a reminder
2016-03-15 04:32:03	+fyr	and by default it's off
2016-03-15 04:32:16	+fyr	so you HAVE to set it if you want to remind yourself
2016-03-15 04:32:33	@xero	like i said, if he forgot to not-push he still would have forgot the reminder flag
2016-03-15 04:33:02	+fyr	but when he created the branch he would have gone 'I need to not push this AT ALL'
2016-03-15 04:33:13	+fyr	at least that's how I would would have thought of it
2016-03-15 04:33:27	tudurom	just don't commit it! case closed

2016-03-15 05:28:08	@rocx	oh crap
2016-03-15 05:28:10	greduan	seriously on idea what I meant to write though
2016-03-15 05:28:15	@rocx	think my hard disk might finally be on the verge of kicking the bucket.

2016-03-15 05:28:58	@rocx	wish they still made <=80G disks.
2016-03-15 05:29:06	Shinryuu	wish mpd wasn't so broken because I love to use my friend's dmenu interface for it but it fails to add some songs sometimes and I have no idea why, updating helps sometimes but now it broke the whole thing again
2016-03-15 05:29:11	@rocx	getting hard to find any that are smaller than a terabyte.

2016-03-15 05:29:36	greduan	I've no idea what I meant
2016-03-15 05:29:42	Shinryuu	I use *.cue files a lot and it doesn't seem to add them correctly, ncmpcpp let's me to add them if I manually add every single of them but there's no way I'm going to do that
2016-03-15 05:29:52	halfwit	Hm
2016-03-15 05:30:16	dcat	isn't a cue file just a cleartext file with the order of songs?
2016-03-15 05:30:25	@xero	and a header i believe
2016-03-15 05:32:13	Shinryuu	the issue is, it works with some *.cue files automatically but on some it just just adds a full *.flac file instead even there's nothing wrong with the file, also it seems to ignore some non-cue *.flac files as well but ncmpcpp add them though and deadbeef adds everything without issues at all
2016-03-15 05:32:53	@rocx	deadbeef's nice.
2016-03-15 05:33:04	@rocx	especially for internet radio.
2016-03-15 05:40:34	Shinryuu	I'm trying to keep deadbeef 'minima' so it works for me, https://files.catbox.moe/eam3kl.png

2016-03-15 05:43:45	@xero	is that venam's triple branch of 2bwm ?
2016-03-15 05:44:07	Shinryuu	indeed, I accidentally found it and I decided to try it out
2016-03-15 05:45:26	@xero	uugghh. finding actual photos for triple monitor setups is a chore.

2016-03-15 05:50:44	halfwit	What do you guys use that's GTK?
2016-03-15 05:51:06	@xero	chromium, gcolor2, gimp
2016-03-15 05:51:14	halfwit	Ah yeah, Gimp.
2016-03-15 05:51:26	@xero	virtualbox i think as well
2016-03-15 05:52:24	irc-5225225	Firefox depends on gtk2 and gtk3, from the looks of it.
2016-03-15 05:52:30	@rocx	firefox, deadbeef, GIMP, mypaint, gcolor2, probably some others.
2016-03-15 05:53:40	halfwit	gcolor2, hm

2016-03-15 05:59:51	halfwit	Stupid me. Not backing up in my wilder days.
2016-03-15 05:59:57	@rocx	aye. used to have a couple of discographies before losing that to a seagate drive.
2016-03-15 06:00:14	@rocx	and looking back, it would've been outdated at the time.

2016-03-15 06:08:20	@rocx	if i had a modem that could access that, i'd be richer than a king.
2016-03-15 06:08:29	Shinryuu	rocx: I don't know what kind of deals you can get outside of this country but I'm happy there are no caps
2016-03-15 06:08:41	@rocx	there are always caps in the US.
2016-03-15 06:08:44	@rocx	always limits.
2016-03-15 06:08:49	Shinryuu	also this is fairly cheap, it's 25,90€ for unlimited internet access, texts and phone calls
2016-03-15 06:08:54	irc-5225225	I aliased cget to `curl -C - -L -O`. Acts the same as wget for normal URLs.
2016-03-15 06:08:56	@xero	even unlimited plans do throttling

2016-03-15 06:10:07	greduan	I just need to dedicate one full weekend to figuring out the whole thing
2016-03-15 06:10:14	Shinryuu	I've never used it so I can't say how it is
2016-03-15 06:10:19	greduan	I mean the Evil-mode stuff
2016-03-15 06:10:24	greduan	NEW DRAGON
2016-03-15 06:10:30	@rocx	greduan: is it the bloat that turns you away? or is it the vi bindings for evil?
2016-03-15 06:11:08	greduan	Both. Emacs' bloat and how unnatural it feels to use Evil in Emacs. I can't put my finger on it but it's probably that EVERYTHING that isn't the text editor has Emacs-like bindings
2016-03-15 06:11:16	greduan	So it doesn't really feel integrated
2016-03-15 06:11:16	halfwit	greduan: Mem.
2016-03-15 06:11:21	halfwit	greduan: GNU though.
2016-03-15 06:11:42	greduan	Honestly don't care if something is GNU or not. If it's good it's good
2016-03-15 06:11:43	@rocx	you could always rebind them. granted that takes a long time of reading others' crap code and docs, but it's an option.
2016-03-15 06:11:48	greduan	the bloat is thanks to RMS though so fuck him
2016-03-15 06:11:49	@rocx	what he said.
2016-03-15 06:11:50	halfwit	Really, I should talk for using neovim. It's a bloated shitshow really
2016-03-15 06:12:01	@rocx	yeah. it'll get less bloated with the new maintainer.
2016-03-15 06:12:02	halfwit	Lol +1
2016-03-15 06:12:22	greduan	RMS' attitude was literally "oh I use this, could we include it in stock Emacs?"
2016-03-15 06:12:31	 > 	seyt (r00ted@Clk-EF1997CA.fbx.proxad.net) has joined #nixers
2016-03-15 06:12:36	greduan	NO WE CANNOT RMS
2016-03-15 06:12:40	@rocx	think one thing that was proposed was getting rid of a lot of stuff and leave that job to the ELPA.
2016-03-15 06:12:48	greduan	god bless that
2016-03-15 06:12:52	greduan	let me know how it goes. lol
2016-03-15 06:12:56	@rocx	hope it happens.
2016-03-15 06:13:10	@rocx	i love using emacs, but it does NOT need TWO IRC clients in a stock install.
2016-03-15 06:13:17	halfwit	rocx: I've been reading one guys' blog a lot
2016-03-15 06:13:24	halfwit	wasamasa's

2016-03-15 06:13:44	@rocx	seen him around in #emacs on FreeNode.
2016-03-15 06:13:44	halfwit	He's on another channel that I'm on, he used to be on Arch all the time

2016-03-15 06:13:56	Shinryuu	same here

2016-03-15 06:30:02	@rocx	half: part of the issue there is that it's "literate" (using org-mode with embedded lisp).
2016-03-15 06:30:14	@rocx	thus not real "code", but a document.
2016-03-15 06:30:53	half	Mm.

2016-03-15 06:42:56	@rocx	yeah. guess your "minimal" would be a couple of terminals for different jobs.
2016-03-15 06:42:58	@rocx	xero: yeah.
2016-03-15 06:43:21	@rocx	whereas mine would be efficently minimizing my needs to what i need. isn't that what minimalism is about? cutting the excess?

2016-03-15 06:47:32	@xero	syntax highlighters: not minimal
2016-03-15 06:47:45	@xero	but we use them b/c they aid us
2016-03-15 06:47:51	@xero	they have a percieved value
2016-03-15 06:48:32	@rocx	thus if we need them because they provide a benefit we make use of, it's still minimal since we use them.
2016-03-15 06:48:48	@rocx	there is no objective definition of minimal. what is minimal will vary from person to person.
2016-03-15 06:48:54	Shinryuu	^
2016-03-15 06:48:54	@xero	i dont think i agree w/ that.
2016-03-15 06:48:59	@xero	i use systemd
2016-03-15 06:49:00	Shinryuu	but it depends
2016-03-15 06:49:04	@xero	but that doesnt mean it's minimal
2016-03-15 06:49:08	Shinryuu	well, I'm on it too
2016-03-15 06:49:15	@xero	they're are far simpler ways to do the same thing
2016-03-15 06:49:18	@rocx	systemd's just a crap anyway.
2016-03-15 06:49:32	greduan	beacon is actually quite minimal. Little addition that makes all the difference. syntax highlighting is just plain not necessary though, although useful sometimes
2016-03-15 06:49:38	@xero	this beacon looks like crap too
2016-03-15 06:49:44	@rocx	so does your bacon.
2016-03-15 06:49:51	@xero	an animation doesnt really add anything
2016-03-15 06:49:56	@xero	just fluf
2016-03-15 06:50:08	@rocx	the animation may be, but it's useful in tracking where the eff my cursor went.
2016-03-15 06:50:10	@xero	any visual cue could achieve the same thing
2016-03-15 06:50:26	half	Heh.
2016-03-15 06:50:33	greduan	i.e., an animation
2016-03-15 06:50:35	greduan	lol
2016-03-15 06:50:46	greduan	visual cue like what? the cursor itself?
2016-03-15 06:51:20	@xero	when like in vim there's cursorline / cursorcol
2016-03-15 06:51:30	@xero	just a background color
2016-03-15 06:51:40	greduan	I don't like having a cursorline though
2016-03-15 06:51:41	@rocx	and you can have them cross to pinpoint where the cursor is.
2016-03-15 06:51:41	@xero	setting them both and making the cross hares
2016-03-15 06:51:42	greduan	or cursorcol
2016-03-15 06:51:44	@xero	not minimal
2016-03-15 06:51:58	half	xero: Sandy has the current line recolor by default, it's nice with the right scheme
2016-03-15 06:52:42	greduan	cursorline + cursorcol = lag
2016-03-15 06:52:42	@xero	i dont really care one way or the other 
2016-03-15 06:52:50	@xero	i'm just arguing semantics

2016-03-15 06:53:11	half	https://www.leatherman.com/skeletool-18.html is something I can't argue against. I want this damn tool.
2016-03-15 06:53:16	@xero	if two highlights are making you lag
2016-03-15 06:53:22	@rocx	one thing i could do minimal on is all these trash buffers that pop up.

2016-03-15 07:32:28	@xero	exactly
2016-03-15 07:32:45	+fyr	wish I'd learnt another layout before i learnt vim :/
2016-03-15 07:32:53	+fyr	now it's too ingrained
2016-03-15 07:33:01	half	fyr: Lol yeah.
2016-03-15 07:33:11	L8D	fyr: where can't you use vim bindings?
2016-03-15 07:33:22	@xero	i learned to type on a typewriter
2016-03-15 07:33:31	+fyr	xero's showing his age again

2016-03-15 07:33:38	+fyr	L8D, what do you mean?
2016-03-15 07:33:39	+fyr	aww
2016-03-15 07:33:40	L8D	I can use vim bindings everywhere from irssi to neovim.
2016-03-15 07:33:46	L8D	s/neovim/bash/L8D
2016-03-15 07:33:48	+fyr	grampa xero
2016-03-15 07:33:53	@rocx	oh man a selectric would be a neat typewriter to have.
2016-03-15 07:33:56	+fyr	L8D, so do I
2016-03-15 07:34:05	@rocx	and so does selectric-mode for emacs.
2016-03-15 07:34:05	+fyr	I'm on about switching keyboard layouts
2016-03-15 07:34:14	L8D	ooooh that's gonna be so hard
2016-03-15 07:34:17	@xero	e.g. hjkl makes no sense on non-qwerty
2016-03-15 07:34:21	@rocx	imagine all the tikka-tikka-tak-taks you could make with selectric-mode.
2016-03-15 07:34:29	@rocx	does vim have a selectric sound effect plugin?
2016-03-15 07:34:30	@rocx	no?
2016-03-15 07:34:32	@rocx	i rest my case.
2016-03-15 07:34:41	+fyr	no we use terminal beeps
2016-03-15 07:34:52	@xero	rocx: sound effect plugins. the definition of minimalism
2016-03-15 07:34:57	L8D	for a minute I tried out dvorak mode on my pok3r and setup the Pn key to bind the dvorak locations back to hjkl so I could use vim
2016-03-15 07:35:04	@rocx	xero: that's not minimalism, but it's fun.
2016-03-15 07:35:10	arc	hello
2016-03-15 07:35:15	L8D	but dvorak isn't for me
2016-03-15 07:35:19	L8D	too much to relearn
2016-03-15 07:35:43	arc	i just use qwerty
2016-03-15 07:35:58	@xero	one of my uni friends says she used devorak just so people would stop trying to use her computer
2016-03-15 07:36:02	half	L8D: It's an investment.
2016-03-15 07:36:03	arc	with minor changes to modifiers
2016-03-15 07:36:06	@xero	i said the same thing about unix
2016-03-15 07:36:22	@rocx	xero: and i need to start using workman to keep QWERTY, dvorak, and colemak users from using my laptop.
2016-03-15 07:36:30	@xero	lel
2016-03-15 07:36:35	L8D	sounds like someone needs to establish personal boundaries
2016-03-15 07:36:38	@rocx	it's so niche, no one will be using it but me.
2016-03-15 07:36:46	L8D	but learning dvorak by will is stil pretty imrpessive
2016-03-15 07:37:00	half	rocx: You should design one based on a heatmap of your work and chat logs over a year
2016-03-15 07:37:01	@rocx	L8D: yeah i had problems with people invading my personal space.
2016-03-15 07:37:04	arc	xero: the last time my parents tried to use my computer they told me "here have it back" five minutes later
2016-03-15 07:37:08	+fyr	people can't deal with blank keycaps
2016-03-15 07:37:09	@rocx	many flash drives were broken by people from it.
2016-03-15 07:37:12	+fyr	that's my method
2016-03-15 07:37:25	@rocx	arc: heh. my parents would be yelling at me to change it back.
2016-03-15 07:37:39	arc	they can type
2016-03-15 07:37:47	L8D	Yeah I used to be such a pushover when it came to dealing with family members
2016-03-15 07:37:47	@rocx	heck, they get pissy because of what i do to *my* laptop.
2016-03-15 07:37:50	arc	but they don't understand wmutils
2016-03-15 07:37:59	L8D	now I stand my ground with confidence and risk being an asshole
2016-03-15 07:38:20	@rocx	standing your ground might be the important part.
2016-03-15 07:38:48	L8D	Like you're my family and all, but there are things I will and won't do no matter who you are
2016-03-15 07:39:02	Shinryuu	:<
2016-03-15 07:39:04	L8D	And if you fail to understand or respect that, it's your problem now.
2016-03-15 07:39:28	L8D	Especially considering everything my family has pressured me into doing for them.
2016-03-15 07:40:02	half	 I'm extra cruel, fyr.
2016-03-15 07:40:08	half	I keey my keycaps qwerty

2016-03-15 07:40:24	arc	my setup is so complex mostly so my parents don't find ~/.local/share/porn
2016-03-15 07:40:42	+fyr	half, BRUTAL
2016-03-15 07:40:52	L8D	arc: you're doing it wrong
2016-03-15 07:40:55	half	fyr: Right, I should be locked the fuck up.
2016-03-15 07:41:07	@xero	L8D++
2016-03-15 07:41:08	arc	L8D: it's encrypted too
2016-03-15 07:41:16	+fyr	absolutely
2016-03-15 07:41:24	L8D	arc: you need to have one of those fucked-up-but-tasteful wallpapers and have your porn tabs open 24/7
2016-03-15 07:41:26	half	arc: Winning. 
2016-03-15 07:41:29	@xero	arc: put it on another partition/drive that is not mounted by default
2016-03-15 07:41:42	half	Heh. The gf puts her porn on the living room HDD for no apparent reason.
2016-03-15 07:41:54	arc	i had a porn vm once
2016-03-15 07:42:11	L8D	or, you know, just stream your porn in an incognito window like everyone else
2016-03-15 07:42:20	@xero	>browsing porn? use tails. because the internet is a dirty place
2016-03-15 07:42:22	L8D	who downloads porn? for real
2016-03-15 07:42:25	@rocx	or be like the people in my government class.
2016-03-15 07:42:30	arc	me
2016-03-15 07:42:33	@rocx	just stream it with people behind you in the middle of class.
2016-03-15 07:42:43	@xero	rocx: yuk
2016-03-15 07:42:46	@rocx	yeah.
2016-03-15 07:42:53	L8D	assert dominance
2016-03-15 07:42:54	half	rocx: As long as it's way obscure fetish porn.

2016-03-15 07:45:21	@rocx	and blinds aren't helping.
2016-03-15 07:45:24	+fyr	I can't tell the difference in a blind test (trust me I've tried)
2016-03-15 07:45:41	+fyr	I also have decent balanced headphones
2016-03-15 07:45:54	@xero	i assumed we shared so much yt music b/c we dont want to up mp3s flacs all the time. it's just faster. and if someone enjoys the song/band they can download it for real themselves.
2016-03-15 07:45:58	+fyr	not particularly bass heavy which is where compression hurts
2016-03-15 07:46:06	half	fyr: But if it's all placebo effect, how can you feel superior with your $50,000 listening room?
2016-03-15 07:46:10	L8D	like listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU8HrO7XuiE and then listen to the same track on http://beerontherug.bandcamp.com/track/420
2016-03-15 07:46:13	half	fyr: You must be stupid.
2016-03-15 07:46:18	L8D	it makes a world of a difference

2016-03-15 07:46:55	half	xero: Wait, but there's worse.
2016-03-15 07:47:21	+fyr	L8D, I'd just like to point out that people who upload tracks to youtube in the first place don't have the most high quality rip either
2016-03-15 07:47:24	half	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXZEEouAqWo
2016-03-15 07:48:00	L8D	fyr: true, but in my example was probably an upload of what they got from bandcamp
2016-03-15 07:48:11	half	But yeah, there's heavily diminishing returns on audio quality
2016-03-15 07:49:09	+fyr	L8D, it's also the most popular one, which means it was probably whoever uploaded first
2016-03-15 07:49:17	+fyr	not neccesary the best quality
2016-03-15 07:49:35	L8D	ok touche
2016-03-15 07:50:00	half	L8D: For the record though, I'm using my fucking phone or laptop speakers 80% of the time, since I'm too poor for proper equipment, so Youtube shit is good enough
2016-03-15 07:50:35	+fyr	the youtube one is worse in the example, but to me only barely
2016-03-15 07:51:14	L8D	Ok. I guess it only applies on a preference and personal basis.
2016-03-15 07:51:50	half	I'm pretty sure I'll get pedantic about it when I buy new headphones
2016-03-15 07:57:11	@xero	ok
2016-03-15 07:57:16	@xero	i defend php quite a bit

2016-03-15 08:32:01	half	If Trumps' main goal was to split decisions so that certain underdogs could look better though, he's doing just that.

2016-03-15 08:46:14	half	It seems like he feels if it isnt GNU, it's not free - which is counterintuitive. I hate that shit, like being a nonconformist with all your friends.
2016-03-15 08:46:19	+fyr	GPL is not a truly 'free' license

2016-03-16 07:24:00	fsociety	the unfortunate part is that it doesnt send urls of images when people send stickers, etc.

2016-03-16 07:24:40	+seth	but I'd use it through ubuntu
2016-03-16 07:25:43	fsociety	all you need to do install bitlbee-libpurple in debian/ubuntu
2016-03-16 07:25:57	fsociety	and compile this https://github.com/majn/telegram-purple
2016-03-16 07:26:07	fsociety	once bitlbee is loaded up in your irc client
2016-03-16 07:26:19	fsociety	you'd then type acc add telegram (mobile number) password
2016-03-16 07:26:25	fsociety	it will the send you the code, blah.. and off you go

2016-03-17 04:46:09	GandalfTheGreyduan	I just had a crazy idea. What if I remap tab to something else that's easy to reach?
2016-03-17 04:46:16	GandalfTheGreyduan	cause right now it completely stops my typing flow
2016-03-17 04:46:29	GandalfTheGreyduan	damn I need an Ergodox keyboard now lol
2016-03-17 04:46:43	@xero	tab is in a great place imo. esc is what i mapped to caps

2016-03-17 04:47:47	@xero	esc is way up in the function key row on my keyboard. i have to move my palm to hit it w/ my pinkey

2016-03-17 05:02:20	boobah	is that how it works? i thought you had to choose the correct drivers during `make menuconfig`
2016-03-17 05:02:32	boobah	i haven't used crux in a while though

2016-03-17 05:11:57	tudurom	boobah: the best way to optimize your kernel with no effort is to compile it first with crux's config file, then boot it, plug in all your thumb drives and strange devices, open up xorg and then do `make localmodconfig`

2016-03-17 05:58:49	@rocx	though using an IRC library for your language tends to work better.

2016-03-17 06:11:38	@rocx	fair enough.
2016-03-17 06:11:46	L8D	they just have a different way of thinking of things, and it usually hinders them as an individual

2016-03-17 06:16:48	@rocx	OCD is basically getting bent out of shape when things aren't that organized.
2016-03-17 06:16:57	L8D	not at all
2016-03-17 06:17:03	L8D	OCD is about compulsion.

2016-03-17 06:17:14	@rocx	xero: dunno. got it from somewhere else. basically describes how those who don't delve further than adviceanimals/memes/ragecomics use "le" a lot.
2016-03-17 06:17:16	half	That's the only important thing said in the last 5 minutes.
2016-03-17 06:17:27	L8D	When there is something that creates an urge and you have no control over how you deal with the urge
2016-03-17 06:18:06	L8D	Where you just *have* to do something, regardless of whether you really want to or if you care
2016-03-17 06:18:27	L8D	People with OCD are very conscious of their compulsion and just have to put up with it
2016-03-17 06:18:33	@rocx	aaaah.

2016-03-17 06:33:46	L8D	greduan: would you recommend CircleCI for internal use?
2016-03-17 06:33:49	L8D	is it pricey?
2016-03-17 06:33:56	@xero	magnium-ci
2016-03-17 06:34:19	greduan	we're using it precisely because it's free up until a point. you can only have one build running and you get like a million minutes or something. or one hundred thousand, I don't remember
2016-03-17 06:34:20	greduan	after which you pay
2016-03-17 06:34:23	half	Bye, everybody. Off to buyy workout gear, oddly enough.
2016-03-17 06:34:24	L8D	do either of those integrate with GitHub?
2016-03-17 06:34:46	half	L8D: I'm still pretty excited about the future, even though it's all in the air about what will happen
2016-03-17 06:34:48	greduan	cya half
2016-03-17 06:34:51	greduan	L8D: yes
2016-03-17 06:34:55	greduan	Circle does
2016-03-17 06:35:02	@xero	L8D: MCI does as well https://magnum-ci.com/docs/integration
2016-03-17 06:35:39	L8D	cool. Been needing to find a useful CI service for internal use for a while
2016-03-17 06:35:47	L8D	in-house CI servers are a PITA
2016-03-17 06:41:33	L8D	ewww magnum CI uses serial identifiers

2016-03-17 06:48:42	@xero	i only use MCI for personal stuff (php). for work we use travis ci, but it's not free (always)

2016-03-17 07:02:10	L8D	yeah Travis CI is really nice but it's on the same level as Heroku
2016-03-17 07:02:33	L8D	it's incredibly easy to use and just oh-my-god so convenient
2016-03-17 07:02:47	L8D	but then when you want to use it for professional use it just gets fucking crazy
2016-03-17 07:02:52	L8D	like san francisco crazy
2016-03-17 07:03:10	L8D	like I could maintain a cocaine addiction with the amount of money my company spends on Heroku each month
2016-03-17 07:04:10	L8D	we could hire 3 new developers with that money, and have them spend all their time moving to AWS
2016-03-17 07:04:12	@xero	yeah, it's the same w/ travis
2016-03-17 07:04:13	L8D	but nooooo
2016-03-17 07:07:02	L8D	Is there any way to put a window in multiple workspaces in i3?
2016-03-17 07:11:14	irc-5225225	L8D: There is the ability for sticky windows (that show up regardless of which workspace you are in)
2016-03-17 07:11:39	irc-5225225	Is this for a single output, or are you trying to make a window show up on 2 different outputs at the same time?
2016-03-17 07:20:49	L8D	irc-5225225: single output. Sticky windows would work
2016-03-17 07:20:54	L8D	irc-5225225: how do I sticky a window in i3?
2016-03-17 07:21:29	irc-5225225	L8D: Want me to link you to the documentation or tell you exactly how to do it?

2016-03-17 07:36:24	@rocx	it seems like the only reason why niche languages like haskell, ocaml, rust, et al have some sort of foothold in modern coding is because these big companies prepare projects in said languages that aren't even going to be used.

2016-03-17 07:55:12	@xero	thang1: nothing
2016-03-17 07:55:18	thang1	lol
2016-03-17 07:55:19	@xero	people were saying "drank"
2016-03-17 07:55:24	@xero	and i was thinking "thang"
2016-03-17 07:55:29	thang1	ah got it
2016-03-17 07:55:42	@xero	plus, haven't heard from you in a while
2016-03-17 07:55:48	@xero	how's it going?
2016-03-17 07:55:48	thang1	Also, haskell/ocaml are entirely different than rust btw
2016-03-17 07:56:07	thang1	It's going bleh, I'm not sure if I'm gonna stay at this uni or not. I might end up having to defend in front of a board 'cause of academic failings
2016-03-17 07:56:28	@xero	l a m e
2016-03-17 07:56:30	thang1	Almost positive I'm gonna tank database systems and I'm pretty sure I have an F in english :p
2016-03-17 07:57:01	thang1	Not that it's hard or anything, both of the classes were very easy. I just can't pace myself and the dorm+cafeteria environment is utterly toxic and poisonous to my soul 
2016-03-17 07:57:22	@xero	yeah, idk if i could have been a dormer or not
2016-03-17 07:57:28	@xero	commuiting was the way to go for me
2016-03-17 07:57:34	thang1	so yeah basically just stress about that stuff kinda prevented me from really doing much and made it really difficult to do stuff
2016-03-17 07:57:50	thang1	and stuff is already extremely difficult just to start since I'm super adhd + some undiagnosed depression issues
2016-03-17 07:58:00	thang1	yeah I need to live the fuck off campus
2016-03-17 07:58:17	thang1	I'm social and shit, I just can't study in a dorm room and I need 24/7 access to a study area, so having a curfew sucks ass
2016-03-17 07:58:38	thang1	I also really enjoy cooking my own food and being reduced to 1-2 meals a day of shitty food when I don't like half the stuff there is just... terrible
2016-03-17 07:58:49	@xero	sounds like it dude
2016-03-17 07:58:59	thang1	It's hard for me to maintain my barely overweight status. Like, I can't even gain weight when I try lol
2016-03-17 07:59:07	thang1	barely underweight**
2016-03-17 07:59:10	L8D	thang1: where do you live where you can't get an internship?
2016-03-17 07:59:20	thang1	What do you mean?
2016-03-17 07:59:20	L8D	thang1: I'd say get an internship or a job, and hold on for dear life
2016-03-17 07:59:34	L8D	thang1: like why go to school if you're not having success with it?
2016-03-17 07:59:40	L8D	thang1: are your parents forcing you to?
2016-03-17 07:59:51	L8D	thang1: why not find a job and drop out now?
2016-03-17 07:59:55	thang1	Oh that's not the issue. The college is a religious university and its rules are "you have to stay in the dorm unti you're either 22, married, or a senior, and you have to eat at the cafeteria with a meal plan if you live in the dorm"
2016-03-17 08:00:12	L8D	woah wtf. RICE?
2016-03-17 08:00:20	L8D	sounds like rice
2016-03-17 08:00:22	thang1	No :p
2016-03-17 08:00:34	L8D	thang1: why not just leave then?
2016-03-17 08:00:35	thang1	It's in washington
2016-03-17 08:00:40	L8D	what's keeping you there?
2016-03-17 08:00:52	thang1	Where else do I go? I can't really transfer anymore thanks to it being a quarter system and my (now tanked) GPA
2016-03-17 08:01:23	thang1	I love theory + CS/math/logic and shit and I'm strongly considering a masters or even a PhD somewhere. College is definitely for me
2016-03-17 08:01:26	L8D	thang1: IDK find a tech job in Seattle or wherever you can reasonably travel to for interviews
2016-03-17 08:01:35	thang1	I like my classes, I actually like the professors and shit
2016-03-17 08:01:46	L8D	thang1: then move down there and live on the streets until your first paycheck and get a lease
2016-03-17 08:01:53	thang1	that's not the problem. The problem is like 100% the dorm+cafeteria + forced worship attendance and "community attendance"
2016-03-17 08:02:03	@xero	uuuggghhh
2016-03-17 08:02:11	*	xero is having catholic hs flashbacks
2016-03-17 08:02:17	thang1	My personality doesn't do super well with being forced into things
2016-03-17 08:02:17	L8D	thang1: then why not bring that up? why not just break the rules and see what happens?
2016-03-17 08:02:31	@rocx	guess we see why xero keeps goats in his sacrificial pen.
2016-03-17 08:02:34	thang1	My mom works in the same religious denomination so she gets 70% off on everything
2016-03-17 08:02:45	@xero	ahh
2016-03-17 08:02:55	L8D	damn that's a tough pickle to be in
2016-03-17 08:02:57	@xero	rocx: wanna kiss him?
2016-03-17 08:03:00	thang1	if I move off campus they'd probably just kick me out. It's also why I went there in the firstp lace, she said "I can afford this, so you go there and that's it"
2016-03-17 08:03:05	@rocx	xero: no thanks, i'm good.
2016-03-17 08:03:29	thang1	If I just say 'fuck y'all I'm moving off campus' even if they let me that's now like $500/month I have to support myself for
2016-03-17 08:03:57	@xero	thang1: maybe you should talk to a counciler
2016-03-17 08:04:00	L8D	thang1: do you have a source of income outside of your mother?
2016-03-17 08:04:02	thang1	I work ~12 hours a week now. With that and child support I can pretty much barely afford it... Like, maybe $10 left over a month if I don't spend too much on gas
2016-03-17 08:04:13	L8D	and talking to a counselor sounds like a good idea
2016-03-17 08:04:19	L8D	wait colleges has counselors?
2016-03-17 08:04:26	@xero	tell them about the adhd/depression and say the school rules are having a negitive effect on you
2016-03-17 08:04:29	thang1	All colleges do. They're usually free too
2016-03-17 08:04:35	@xero	always free
2016-03-17 08:04:39	@xero	i think it's a law
2016-03-17 08:04:47	@xero	it dont think it could hurt
2016-03-17 08:04:48	thang1	sounds right...
2016-03-17 08:05:02	thang1	Anyway, I'm gathering evidence and reasoning and support for *why* the rules suck
2016-03-17 08:05:17	@xero	coming w/ logical suggestions will help a lot too
2016-03-17 08:05:26	thang1	'cause I've already talked with the disability person before and she was like "your curfew is 2am, if you're not getting your homework done by then why the fuck should I let you have a senior 5am curfew?"
2016-03-17 08:05:58	thang1	which is the most fucking retarded logic. It's basically "what you're doing isn't working. Until it starts working I can't let you do something different. You better magically fix yourself"
2016-03-17 08:06:01	@xero	>bitch b/c that's when my brain works best!
2016-03-17 08:06:19	@rocx	problem is that you need empirical evidence for that.
2016-03-17 08:06:21	thang1	Well it's more how ADHD is extrordinarily good at procrastinating
2016-03-17 08:06:35	@rocx	timestamped git logs for a project, if you're in a CS major?
2016-03-17 08:06:46	@xero	rocx: push times
2016-03-17 08:06:48	thang1	So if I put myself in a situation where I can't escape it (ie being awake all night), it's a lot easier to start since I'm resigned to it
2016-03-17 08:06:51	@xero	you can fake local timestamps
2016-03-17 08:06:57	@rocx	xero: they don't know that.
2016-03-17 08:06:58	L8D	I get they're religious, but why the fuck is there a curfew anyways? Like it is just a dorm sound curfew or something?
2016-03-17 08:07:04	thang1	but if I know I can procrastinate until 2am and then I have to be in an environment where I can't even study
2016-03-17 08:07:13	thang1	It's 'cause it's a religious university
2016-03-17 08:07:25	L8D	do they think you're doing the evil deed past 2am?
2016-03-17 08:07:30	thang1	It's about control, hand holding and coddling sheltered kids so they don't kill themselves
2016-03-17 08:07:31	@xero	L8D: can't be out during the witching hour
2016-03-17 08:07:41	L8D	weird
2016-03-17 08:07:43	thang1	Too much freedom really destroys sheltered people
2016-03-17 08:07:48	@rocx	thang1: iunno, that kind of place seems like a good area for kids to kill themselves.
2016-03-17 08:07:55	L8D	that makes a lot of sense actually
2016-03-17 08:08:00	thang1	Like, I had a friend of mine just wreck himself freshman year  because he had too much freedom
2016-03-17 08:08:12	thang1	(midnight curfew and no parental supervision was too much for him compared to high school)
2016-03-17 08:08:37	thang1	It's a difference of personality. if you're a coddled pushover kinda person who doesn't question authority and simply obeys
2016-03-17 08:08:42	thang1	it works really well for you and you love the dorms
2016-03-17 08:09:04	thang1	Like, objectively speaking, the cafeteria is good by cafeteria standards and the dorm is pretty decent by dorm standards. The wifi is much better than average, etc
2016-03-17 08:09:20	thang1	I'm just not that personality so the dorms kill my soul
2016-03-17 08:10:29	L8D	thang1: so you do all this just for the classes and professors?
2016-03-17 08:11:30	L8D	sounds like stockholm syndrome or you just really, really love your classes and professors
2016-03-17 08:13:21	thang1	I enjoy the classes and professors
2016-03-17 08:13:38	thang1	also there's literally nowhere else to go at this point. Home kills me and it's in a small city
2016-03-17 08:13:57	thang1	I'd have to go to my dads house, abandon the child support payments, and magically find a programming job with no real world programming experience
2016-03-17 08:14:19	thang1	I have tons of theory but I can't program for shit compared to what's expected in a "we're going to pay you real money" job
2016-03-17 08:15:01	thang1	There's also the aspect that I actually do wanna continue college and go for a higher degree... Dropping out and becoming a code monkey isn't really what I wanna do. I'd do it if I had to, of course, but eh
2016-03-17 08:15:33	thang1	sort of a catch 22 y'know? Can't get out without better grades, can't improve my grades because I can't get out
2016-03-17 08:16:05	L8D	thang1: if you can show that you're enthusiastic about programming and that you're willing and able to learn, any company with the right amount of time on their hands will want to hire you
2016-03-17 08:16:08	thang1	Only outside way would be to get a job for a few years or so and completely reset my undergrad from almost entirely the beginning...
2016-03-17 08:16:35	L8D	thang1: even then, you don't necessarily need to magically get a programming job
2016-03-17 08:17:09	L8D	thang1: I know you might hate it or find it even more depressing, but working minimum wage at Mickey D's ain't the worst thing you can do at your age
2016-03-17 08:17:19	thang1	Yeah, I know. I can work other things to pass time and work my way up. I'd just rather not if I could. I'm two quarters away from senior status (one quarter behind now because of failing classes due to the environment)
2016-03-17 08:17:20	L8D	unless you feel like you've already gone through that phase and you know you're sick of it
2016-03-17 08:17:28	L8D	but who the fuck am I to tell someone like you what to do?
2016-03-17 08:17:46	L8D	I'm a fucking teenager with all the privelidge in the world
2016-03-17 08:17:56	thang1	I work at custodial right now and I did it full time over the summer. I could work Micky D's but I've done my time in minimum wage, I think. No more character buildling left in it, at least :p
2016-03-17 08:19:01	thang1	But yeah my gpa is 2.6ish right now and probably will drop this quarter a bit more...
2016-03-17 08:19:43	greduan	too much blue in my screen right now
2016-03-17 08:20:00	thang1	wut

2016-03-17 08:20:34	@xero	i still think your best bet is talking things over w/ the councillor and seeing if you can go anywhere w/ that. perhaps they will be more leanient since you're trying to help yourself.
2016-03-17 08:20:47	thang1	yeah definitely. I need to email them
2016-03-17 08:21:16	@xero	hidious. osx, weechat, default green tmux, that font...
2016-03-17 08:21:48	thang1	my eyes got cancer from it
2016-03-17 08:22:22	@xero	also weird that the window is only slightly rounded but the drop shadow is almost circular

2016-03-17 08:22:53	thang1	For fucks fucking sake

2016-03-17 08:23:09	@rocx	oh.
2016-03-17 08:23:15	@rocx	heh.
2016-03-17 08:23:20	thang1	Hello world in a production COUNSELING website?
2016-03-17 08:23:28	thang1	way to give me a vote of fucking encouragement, bitches
2016-03-17 08:23:37	@rocx	ah.
2016-03-17 08:23:42	thang1	at least the website is #webScale aka #iDidJavaScriptWrong
2016-03-17 08:25:24	@fro	greduan: that looks bad
2016-03-17 08:25:38	@fro	and i mean that in many different ways

2016-03-17 08:27:37	greduan	like you're pink for me, so it looks nice
2016-03-17 08:28:00	@xero	fro: he just called you a communist

2016-03-17 09:08:05	greduan	I care more about the debugging shit. i.e. pause points, analyze data as it's going by pausing the engine, etc.

2016-03-17 09:08:39	@xero	hrm
2016-03-17 09:08:59	greduan	it just pauses the whole engine
2016-03-17 09:09:05	greduan	you get to a pause point and the engine just stops
2016-03-17 09:09:10	greduan	and you can see the state of all the vars and shit
2016-03-17 09:09:20	greduan	you put it on play again and boom
2016-03-17 09:09:26	greduan	and you can monitor async with several pause points
2016-03-17 09:09:28	@xero	i mean if you're mid way throught a web request
2016-03-17 09:09:41	@xero	i wonder if it cues the response or what

2016-03-17 10:59:58	@rocx	 what even defines "retina"?
2016-03-17 11:00:06	@rocx	just that the pixel density's greater?
2016-03-17 11:00:44	@rocx	the problem with "retina" displays sometimes is that everything's going to be the same proportions as, say, 1366x768, but a little more detailed.
2016-03-17 11:01:16	@rocx	and arc probably has it just as bad 'cause he's on a laptop.

2016-03-17 13:16:13	@rocx	either something dumb in the way it was packaged for void or a problem on my end. never had a working (La)TeX installation.
2016-03-17 13:16:18	@rocx	going to stick with troff.
2016-03-17 13:17:02	@rocx	maybe see what wise words Doug McIlroy will impart to the groff mailing list.

2016-03-17 13:19:44	@rocx	yeah the packaging is by far the worst aspect of it.
2016-03-17 13:20:00	half	Thats easy to fix.
2016-03-17 13:20:02	@rocx	sad thing is that packaging is one of the most important aspects of a distro/OS.
2016-03-17 13:20:13	@rocx	oh. no. i'm not moving to CRUX.
2016-03-17 13:20:28	half	No, I mean fixing packages is easy
2016-03-17 13:20:34	half	lol
2016-03-17 13:21:02	@rocx	in a way, yeah. i fixed the adobe-flash-player plugin for XBPS.
2016-03-17 13:21:14	half	Nice.
2016-03-17 13:21:51	@rocx	half: eh. they put restriction on it, requiring a person to clone the void-packages repo and toggle a flag to allow installing of restricted packages.

2016-03-17 13:22:29	@rocx	i had to fix it because academia still hasn't gotten the message that flash is dead.

2016-03-17 23:09:45	@rocx	after seeing this class, i can believe that there a bunch of "programmers" that can't fo fizzbuzz.
2016-03-17 23:10:28	%kirby	It took you this long to realise?
2016-03-17 23:11:03	@rocx	kirby: i always thought it as mostly a myth.
2016-03-17 23:11:10	%kirby	lol
2016-03-17 23:11:26	@rocx	but i got a text last night from a classmate about how to write pseudocode.
2016-03-17 23:11:43	@rocx	conditionals are a task too taxing for those in this class.
2016-03-17 23:11:51	%kirby	I feel like I'm in a weird situation in my class because I'm up there in my ability to program, but near the bottom of the pile for the maths stuff
2016-03-17 23:13:47	@rocx	same,.
2016-03-17 23:13:54	@rocx	hopefully that'll change.

2016-03-17 23:19:28	@rocx	yeah i think it might be an issue with either how the class is taught since we tend to beat around the bush a lot in hopes of everyone understanding it or that coding is just not for these people.
2016-03-17 23:19:44	@rocx	the few that _do_ have coding experience in here did mostly python.
2016-03-17 23:19:52	@rocx	that would definitely explain.

2016-03-18 03:15:14	L8D	greduan: Elixir is just good at marketing
2016-03-18 03:15:31	L8D	"functional" programming and "zero-cost abstractions" my ass
2016-03-18 03:19:07	greduan	L8D: have you used it?
2016-03-18 03:21:01	L8D	greduan: yeah and it sucks. Very few ways to distinguish between implementation and interface
2016-03-18 03:21:17	L8D	Meaning fewer ways to abstract systems and invert the dependency tree
2016-03-18 03:21:36	L8D	Almost everything, from the database connection to application configuration is canonically global
2016-03-18 03:21:59	L8D	it's not considered a problem because "it's all concurrent and atomic and stuff" but that's not that point
2016-03-18 03:22:28	L8D	The point is about maintainability and re-usability. And when one system hard-codes a reference to the implementation of another system, you cannot re-use that system with an alternative or abstracted implementation
2016-03-18 03:22:40	L8D	it makes it harder and harder to introduce new features and keep systems well-separated
2016-03-18 03:23:12	L8D	not to mention the fact that all the functions are put under the scope of their module or process, and it almost completely destroys context encapsulation
2016-03-18 03:23:22	greduan	You mean how you can have like String, HashDict, etc. etc. without having to import it first
2016-03-18 03:23:22	L8D	s/put/percieved
2016-03-18 03:23:36	greduan	?
2016-03-18 03:23:39	L8D	greduan: that part is unimportant and trivial
2016-03-18 03:23:46	greduan	ok
2016-03-18 03:24:14	L8D	greduan: I'm talking about how most apps canonically have a global process for a shared resource
2016-03-18 03:24:32	greduan	Like for example?
2016-03-18 03:24:38	L8D	where any system that needs access to it just references the global process 
2016-03-18 03:24:44	L8D	for example, say you have a database with some data in it
2016-03-18 03:24:48	greduan	OK
2016-03-18 03:25:09	L8D	and you have a system responsible for searching a table in that database and sorting the results by a priority ranking or something
2016-03-18 03:25:17	greduan	OK
2016-03-18 03:26:26	L8D	So this System A needs to access the database. Because it's not OOP where there is a difference between where you construct/instantiate System A with say the database connection, in Elixir everything is just a function with access to it's parameters and the global scope
2016-03-18 03:26:44	L8D	so you can implement System A where it accesses some global Ecto module that is your database connection
2016-03-18 03:27:00	L8D	and then System B, which needs the search results from System A, doesn't need to care that System A uses the database
2016-03-18 03:27:24	greduan	What does it do?
2016-03-18 03:27:26	L8D	In this case, because System A uses a global variable, it abstracts away the fact it connects to the database
2016-03-18 03:27:42	L8D	The alternative is to have System B pass in the database connection as an argument
2016-03-18 03:27:55	L8D	and that means System A can be re-used with different database connections and such
2016-03-18 03:28:04	L8D	but it also means that System A's implementation is a leaky abstraction
2016-03-18 03:28:17	L8D	the database connection is an implementation detail that should be abstracted away
2016-03-18 03:28:35	greduan	FYI you still haven't made a good point, for me, of how all of this is bad. lol
2016-03-18 03:28:42	L8D	but it isn't because System B would know that System A accesses the database because it has to take a database connection as an argument
2016-03-18 03:28:47	L8D	so both of those solutions suck
2016-03-18 03:28:54	L8D	and both are canonical for Elixir
2016-03-18 03:29:12	L8D	If there was a way to distinguish between the implementation of a system and the interface of a system
2016-03-18 03:29:19	greduan	System B not caring about how System A gets its data is good
2016-03-18 03:29:32	L8D	Where System B only knows that System A gives search results and doesn't care how it got them
2016-03-18 03:29:49	greduan	That's good
2016-03-18 03:30:02	L8D	yeah but that's only achievable with global variables in Elixir
2016-03-18 03:30:05	L8D	which is what I'm saying
2016-03-18 03:30:10	L8D	with OOP, System A would be a class
2016-03-18 03:30:22	L8D	System B would depend on System A's interface, and not know how System A's instance is constructed
2016-03-18 03:30:31	L8D	then System A could have the database connection passed in through the constructor
2016-03-18 03:30:40	L8D	and the fact that System A uses the database remains abstract
2016-03-18 03:30:59	L8D	some other point in the application you still have to construct an instance of System A and provide a database connection
2016-03-18 03:31:13	L8D	but System A and System B remain re-usable and configurable
2016-03-18 03:31:19	L8D	and neither would depend on a global variable
2016-03-18 03:31:33	L8D	It's very hard to abstract things away in that manner in a language like Elixir
2016-03-18 03:31:45	L8D	You can create a process that recieves messages and responds and stuff
2016-03-18 03:31:49	greduan	See where I work, unless you need one DB connection for each request (for some reason), the DB is global.
2016-03-18 03:32:02	greduan	Because in a monolith with only one DB, a global only makes sense.
2016-03-18 03:32:04	L8D	but that only applies on a per-process level and Elixir has no idioms to support that on a basic programming level
2016-03-18 03:32:34	greduan	It seems to me that you have a big problem with globals, right?
2016-03-18 03:32:54	L8D	yeah I have a big problem with globals
2016-03-18 03:33:06	L8D	They make things more coupled and harder to re-use
2016-03-18 03:33:10	greduan	In a monolith, a global to the DB is not bad.
2016-03-18 03:33:14	greduan	In fact I'd argue it's good
2016-03-18 03:33:30	greduan	Since you're not reopening a connection to the DB every time you need something from the DB.
2016-03-18 03:33:52	L8D	greduan: the implementation of how you establish a connection to the database is irrelevant
2016-03-18 03:34:03	L8D	you can connect to the database and pass around the connection and achieve the same thing
2016-03-18 03:34:26	L8D	the fact that it is or is not a global variable doesn't dictate how you establish a connection
2016-03-18 03:35:02	L8D	if anything, being a global variable is *more* restrictive in that case, becuase maybe that database connection module needs to initialize when the application starts up
2016-03-18 03:35:07	L8D	and it can do that in a number of ways
2016-03-18 03:35:33	L8D	it can establish a connection when the module loads, which means resources can leak and it would be done unnecessarily when say, you're running unit tests
2016-03-18 03:35:41	greduan	OK so the big problem is that it likes to use globals. So you don't like a whole lang because one of the best ways to solve problems in it is using globals.
2016-03-18 03:35:49	L8D	or you can have a line in your entry point that deliberately starts the connection
2016-03-18 03:36:08	L8D	both are bad, and starting the connection in your entry point in such a disjointed fashion is just asking for bad things to happen
2016-03-18 03:36:35	L8D	greduan: yeah. It encourages the use of globals and discourages intellegent and powerful abstraction
2016-03-18 03:36:54	greduan	But System B doesn't have to know that System A uses the DB. That's abstraction.
2016-03-18 03:36:57	L8D	greduan: and it means you can end up with Elixir/Erlang code that is just god-awful and hard to maintain because everything is either tightly coupled or globalized
2016-03-18 03:37:15	L8D	greduan: In Elixir that abstraction can only happen if you use globals
2016-03-18 03:37:37	L8D	greduan: with OOP, or other languages with ways of inverting the dependency tree (like Haskell) then you can provide that abstraction without using global variables
2016-03-18 03:37:46	greduan	OK
2016-03-18 03:37:48	greduan	I see
2016-03-18 03:37:51	L8D	greduan: and you can leverage those types of abstractions to reduce bloat and duplication
2016-03-18 03:38:05	greduan	Quick question: What do you usually program in?
2016-03-18 03:38:10	L8D	in Elixir, you can make up for it with metaprogramming but that's not solving the original problem and it frustrates the hell out of me
2016-03-18 03:38:19	L8D	greduan: I write JavaScript by day and Haskell by night
2016-03-18 03:38:32	greduan	JS bro :D
2016-03-18 03:38:53	L8D	:D
2016-03-18 03:39:09	greduan	I write JS by day and night but soon Elixir by night and some hours of the day. Our CTO wants to move on to something that isn't JS for the back end. He is not convinced JS is good for the back end.
2016-03-18 03:39:20	greduan	Note he's been writing JS for the back for a couple years.
2016-03-18 03:39:37	greduan	Which is why I'm learning Elixir
2016-03-18 03:40:04	greduan	And I agree, JS somehow is not suitable for the back end.
2016-03-18 03:41:12	greduan	And since most of the time we write with globals (because of the lib we use for classes, which comes from the CTO's old company he worked at), I really do not think he'd find a problem with Elixir's handling of globals.
2016-03-18 03:41:17	L8D	I mean node.js is a great platform for microservice architecture and general network programming with streams and stuff
2016-03-18 03:41:30	greduan	Oh BTW, note, in Elixir you can do factory functions, yeah?
2016-03-18 03:41:45	greduan	So you can actually abstract System A like you wanted to, without globals.
2016-03-18 03:41:46	L8D	but node.js sucks for monolithic cloud/node architectures and it's even worse at computing
2016-03-18 03:42:01	L8D	greduan: you can, but it's not canonical and it gets weird
2016-03-18 03:42:15	L8D	like you'd be passing around a bunch of named records with key -> function shapes
2016-03-18 03:42:21	greduan	It's not canonical? A function is a closure so it is canonical.
2016-03-18 03:42:24	L8D	and in that case you're just re-implementing objects in Elixir
2016-03-18 03:42:29	L8D	and people look at you weird
2016-03-18 03:42:33	greduan	lol
2016-03-18 03:44:24	greduan	The System factory could return a bunch of models and you interact with those models normally
2016-03-18 03:44:30	greduan	System A
2016-03-18 03:44:31	greduan	*
2016-03-18 03:45:17	greduan	That it can be done without globals, it can be done. You're just adamant about the globals being bad thing. lol
2016-03-18 03:45:30	L8D	greduan: by factory, do you mean something that starts a bunch of child processes?
2016-03-18 03:45:37	greduan	No?
2016-03-18 03:45:46	L8D	oh
2016-03-18 03:45:57	greduan	Factory is literally a function that returns an instance of something.
2016-03-18 03:46:05	greduan	The functional equivalent of Class instances
2016-03-18 03:46:20	greduan	Only work of if the lang does closures for each function
2016-03-18 03:46:48	greduan	so for example SystemA(dbSettings) returns an instance of the DB with those settings. As an example.
2016-03-18 03:47:13	greduan	Instead of new SystemA(dbSettings) returning an instance of the class which holds an instance of the DB
2016-03-18 03:47:42	L8D	greduan: but then, how do you call methods on that database connection?
2016-03-18 03:47:52	L8D	greduan: are you doing, DatabseConnection.query(conn, ...) ?
2016-03-18 03:47:57	L8D	because that's how Ecto works
2016-03-18 03:48:09	L8D	and it sort of works but it still means you're hard-referencing the implementation
2016-03-18 03:48:16	L8D	and there isn't any polymorphism
2016-03-18 03:48:18	greduan	Learn you knub https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImwrezYhw4w
2016-03-18 03:55:30	greduan	have you learnt?:
2016-03-18 03:58:37	greduan	Anonymous functions have closures in Elixir. Thus you have factory functions. Thus you have, to an extent, OOP. At least in terms of instances and that stuff.
2016-03-18 03:58:57	@xero	well that wasnt fun
2016-03-18 03:59:03	@xero	google's dns just shit the bed
2016-03-18 03:59:10	@xero	20-40ms responce times :S
2016-03-18 03:59:19	greduan	response* right?
2016-03-18 03:59:25	@xero	had to switch 400+ servers to use opendns
2016-03-18 03:59:28	@xero	greduan: yes. i cannot spell
2016-03-18 03:59:36	greduan	you are not a wizard
2016-03-18 03:59:40	greduan	as you once made me think
2016-03-18 03:59:53	greduan	congrats on figuring that out though
2016-03-18 04:00:02	greduan	glad I'm not a sysadmin lol
2016-03-18 04:00:12	@xero	was it wizardly that i wrote a shell script to do all the updates for me?
2016-03-18 04:00:18	@xero	i just had to check them afterwords?
2016-03-18 04:00:41	greduan	nah
2016-03-18 04:00:42	+fyr	xero,tell me about it
2016-03-18 04:00:44	greduan	you said you can't spell
2016-03-18 04:00:48	greduan	thus you'er not a wizard
2016-03-18 04:00:52	+fyr	my isp is dying
2016-03-18 04:00:56	@xero	oh KEKL
2016-03-18 04:01:02	@xero	puns
2016-03-18 04:01:10	greduan	thx for laughing
2016-03-18 04:01:21	irc-5225225	xero: Isn't that what you're meant to do if you have to do something on 400+ servers
2016-03-18 04:01:22	greduan	L8D: have you learnt about factory funcs?
2016-03-18 04:01:34	@xero	irc-5225225: yup
2016-03-18 04:01:43	@xero	but that doesnt mean people do
2016-03-18 04:01:55	@xero	i have to update all out chef cookbooks now to have the same change
2016-03-18 04:02:05	@xero	for when they all run at the top of the next hour
2016-03-18 04:02:14	greduan	chef is Ruby, right?
2016-03-18 04:02:24	L8D	greduan: "factory function" is a very ambigious term
2016-03-18 04:02:32	L8D	sometimes it means higher-order function, sometimes it means constructor
2016-03-18 04:02:39	greduan	lol
2016-03-18 04:02:43	irc-5225225	As part of school, we had to do a week of work experience. (Where we basically went somewhere and "worked" with them).
2016-03-18 04:02:45	greduan	factory function pattern is a very clear term.
2016-03-18 04:02:47	L8D	sometimes constructor means the constructor
2016-03-18 04:02:52	L8D	sometimes it means "something that constructs"
2016-03-18 04:02:55	@xero	greduan: yes. and i hate ruby so much
2016-03-18 04:03:03	irc-5225225	I went with the school's IT department, and my job was both installing printers and checking laptops. I was the shell script.
2016-03-18 04:03:03	greduan	xero: what's up?
2016-03-18 04:03:21	greduan	L8D: did you watch the vid?
2016-03-18 04:03:28	@xero	>greduan │ chef is Ruby, right?
2016-03-18 04:03:38	@xero	yes it is. and i hate ruby so much
2016-03-18 04:03:39	greduan	xero: I know, I mean why do you hate it?
2016-03-18 04:03:42	@xero	oh
2016-03-18 04:03:48	@xero	the syntax and the assumptions
2016-03-18 04:03:53	greduan	which ones?
2016-03-18 04:03:56	L8D	greduan: not yet
2016-03-18 04:04:03	greduan	fucking watch it. lol
2016-03-18 04:04:12	greduan	once you watch it ping me so we can continue this conversation
2016-03-18 04:04:16	@xero	i hate white space centric langs for starters
2016-03-18 04:04:24	greduan	xero: it's got blocks though?
2016-03-18 04:04:33	@xero	and i'm not a fan of "magic" langugaes that write a lot of code for you
2016-03-18 04:04:35	greduan	all those `end`s should be proof. lol
2016-03-18 04:04:58	@xero	most chef stuff is erb templates
2016-03-18 04:05:03	@xero	with are _LAME_
2016-03-18 04:05:45	L8D	looks like xero has a lisp
2016-03-18 04:05:49	L8D	I mean lithp
2016-03-18 04:06:23	greduan	xero: so Ruby isn't bad, it's the ERB templates
2016-03-18 04:06:45	L8D	Ruby still has a ton of meta-programming and magic
2016-03-18 04:06:52	@xero	nah, they're both lame
2016-03-18 04:07:13	@xero	i saw ruby ruin a locally company
2016-03-18 04:07:26	@xero	they did everything in ruby, including all their db stuff
2016-03-18 04:07:35	@xero	which was a meta-magic
2016-03-18 04:07:45	@xero	and it didnt scale for shit
2016-03-18 04:08:01	greduan	I mean every lang can ruin someone if used incorrectly
2016-03-18 04:08:03	@xero	they got really popular and it wrecked their infrastructure
2016-03-18 04:08:23	@xero	and they didnt have the capatol to re-engeneer everything
2016-03-18 04:08:44	L8D	greduan: yeah, so in many cases the choice of language doesn't matter
2016-03-18 04:08:58	L8D	it only matters how much discipline you have and how much you can enforce on others
2016-03-18 04:08:59	greduan	L8D: in most cases yeah
2016-03-18 04:09:12	L8D	it's really nice when a language disciplines you for you
2016-03-18 04:09:16	L8D	like Haskell, or C++
2016-03-18 04:09:20	greduan	Or Clojure
2016-03-18 04:09:22	greduan	:3
2016-03-18 04:09:51	greduan	Shit makes you allergic to complexity
2016-03-18 04:10:05	L8D	there are so many ways you can shoot yourself in the foot with C++ that people are forced to pay attention to how they build things because it really matters in the short-term and it pays off in the long-term
2016-03-18 04:10:29	 > 	tudurom (tudurom@B5334C93.112ED6.81F69A13.IP) has joined #nixers
2016-03-18 04:10:37	greduan	fuck I just came up with an awesome name for `git fetch ; git merge`, `git metch`
2016-03-18 04:10:38	L8D	with languages that let you hack stuff together and be "productive" there is no discipline and you end up with a fucking mess
2016-03-18 04:10:41	greduan	I just typed that by accident
2016-03-18 04:10:59	L8D	and Haskell just doesn't let you do bad things to begin with, which means it's a lot harder to get right and learn from the start
2016-03-18 04:11:05	greduan	yup
2016-03-18 04:11:33	L8D	with C++ you can learn with trial by fire and just learn as you fail and progress pretty quickly
2016-03-18 04:11:57	L8D	greduan: isn't git fetch && git merge the same as git pull?
2016-03-18 04:12:07	L8D	and git fetch && git rebase is the same as git pull --rebase
2016-03-18 04:12:52	L8D	it's counter intuitive of course, because plenty of C++ programmers will learn Python or something and be like "where has this been all my life this is amazing"
2016-03-18 04:13:08	L8D	and they can do everything in just a few lines and not worry about types and all the things
2016-03-18 04:13:35	L8D	but when there are no short-term downsides to writing bad code, you're much more likely to write bad code :(
2016-03-18 04:13:54	greduan	L8D: they are not the same
2016-03-18 04:14:00	greduan	git pull adds some magic
2016-03-18 04:14:11	greduan	also with git fetch + git merge you get to review the changes before merging them
2016-03-18 04:14:48	L8D	greduan: ok but you shouldn't be doing git fetch + git merge or git pull anyways
2016-03-18 04:14:57	greduan	what should you be doing?
2016-03-18 04:15:00	greduan	those are the only ways
2016-03-18 04:15:08	L8D	you should be working on separate branches on a per-person basis so the origin doesn't update without you
2016-03-18 04:15:17	L8D	only one person should be commiting to a branch at a time
2016-03-18 04:15:30	L8D	and then, even if you have multiple people working on the same branch, you should to git pull --rebase
2016-03-18 04:15:33	greduan	sorry but we have a sprint branch off of which we branch out, and to which working changes are merged.
2016-03-18 04:15:41	L8D	and just rewrite your local history instead of constantly doing merges
2016-03-18 04:15:58	greduan	each person only works on one branch at a time
2016-03-18 04:16:10	greduan	when their changes are ready they're tested, reviewed and merged back to the sprint branch
2016-03-18 04:16:15	greduan	new branches come off from the sprint branch
2016-03-18 04:16:32	L8D	then you shouldn't be having to "git pull" in most cases
2016-03-18 04:16:38	greduan	(so as to have the latest changes and test your new changes along with the previous changes, for integration purposes)
2016-03-18 04:16:44	greduan	only when I branch out
2016-03-18 04:16:51	greduan	do I do a git fetch and git merge
2016-03-18 04:16:53	L8D	oh in that case you should be rebasing your feature branch
2016-03-18 04:16:59	L8D	whenever the master/sprint branch changes
2016-03-18 04:17:04	L8D	instead of merging it back in
2016-03-18 04:17:17	greduan	master != sprint
2016-03-18 04:17:57	L8D	http://www.bitsnbites.eu/?p=221
2016-03-18 04:18:06	greduan	master is production, development is staging, sprint-DATE is sprint branch, what changes are merged to during the sprint. Sprint finishes and you merge sprint into development and you test shit. Once that's done you merge sprint into master
2016-03-18 04:18:11	greduan	is that famous flow?
2016-03-18 04:18:12	L8D	greduan: same idea though, the sprint branch is what all the feature branches come off of
2016-03-18 04:18:38	greduan	read later: new link
2016-03-18 04:18:58	L8D	greduan: there are different flows, for tighter release cycles teams will just have a master branch and small feature branches
2016-03-18 04:19:27	L8D	because there isn't a real reason to have a staging and a master branch if master only follows staging
2016-03-18 04:19:54	greduan	sorry missed a step
2016-03-18 04:20:11	greduan	staging is where you merge your feature branches to test it before merging into sprint
2016-03-18 04:20:30	greduan	development NEVER goes to master because it's messy as fuck.
2016-03-18 04:20:35	greduan	only sprint branches go into master.
2016-03-18 04:20:43	L8D	if you're doing things in JavaScript, why do you need to push to staging to test anything?
2016-03-18 04:20:54	greduan	because it's in JS?
2016-03-18 04:20:55	greduan	lol
2016-03-18 04:20:56	L8D	why not just run a CI server on every branch?
2016-03-18 04:21:11	greduan	shush we're evolving. latest project we've got CI for the whole back.
2016-03-18 04:21:15	greduan	front end has no tests though
2016-03-18 04:21:38	greduan	so you need a staging to test all the integration
2016-03-18 04:21:55	L8D	well if you're team is reliant on a slow and builky staging environment to be properly reviewed then you are headed for disaster IMO
2016-03-18 04:22:08	L8D	I guess if you have intergration problems then maybe not
2016-03-18 04:22:49	L8D	but you're infrustructre should be simple enough that other developers can quickly check out a branch and test things locally. And then for release cycles you can do a big all-in-one test with the staging environment and after confirming the integration works just promote it to production
2016-03-18 04:23:02	greduan	I know you do JS, but what's your job? lol
2016-03-18 04:23:18	greduan	we know shit is wrong.
2016-03-18 04:23:23	greduan	which is why we fix it.
2016-03-18 04:23:25	L8D	ah
2016-03-18 04:23:39	L8D	I'm a JavaScript developer, if that's what you're asking?
2016-03-18 04:23:43	greduan	ye
2016-03-18 04:23:46	L8D	my title is just "software engineer" though
2016-03-18 04:23:49	greduan	but like, what sort of company?
2016-03-18 04:24:04	L8D	oh, this startup: https://www.goodybag.com/
2016-03-18 04:24:23	greduan	nice
2016-03-18 04:24:30	greduan	I work at http://empathia.agency
2016-03-18 04:25:15	L8D	well you're front page certainly looks really nice
2016-03-18 04:25:18	L8D	A+ on that design
2016-03-18 04:25:29	greduan	will let our designers know. :)
2016-03-18 04:25:40	greduan	looks really good though cause our front end guy is a perfectionist
2016-03-18 04:26:04	greduan	he'll do shit pixel per pixel to the design, as long as he doesn't have a major problem with the design.
2016-03-18 04:26:13	greduan	even then after some grumbling he'll do it perfect.
2016-03-18 04:26:21	greduan	oh in the about us you can see me. :3
2016-03-18 04:26:31	greduan	I was skinnier then though
2016-03-18 04:29:00	tudurom	i'm impressed of how fast the website loads
2016-03-18 04:30:10	greduan	the whole website is loaded once I think, the pages are just front end routing
2016-03-18 04:30:24	tudurom	impressed++
2016-03-18 04:30:26	greduan	nuestro front end es una verga
2016-03-18 04:30:45	greduan	translation: our front end is fucking awesome
2016-03-18 04:30:51	tudurom	indeed
2016-03-18 04:31:04	tudurom	but i don't even know if that's portuguese of spannish
2016-03-18 04:31:07	greduan	verga means dick BTW, bad word. But if you're a verga it means you're great.
2016-03-18 04:31:11	greduan	Spanish
2016-03-18 04:31:20	greduan	Mexican Spanish specifically
2016-03-18 04:31:32	tudurom	strange...
2016-03-18 04:31:35	greduan	lol
2016-03-18 04:31:56	greduan	we just say things differently
2016-03-18 04:32:04	greduan	like
2016-03-18 04:32:05	%adam	whats fucking in spanish?
2016-03-18 04:32:08	tudurom	from now on, if someone makes me a dick, i will tell them that that means great
2016-03-18 04:32:16	greduan	tudurom: context. lol
2016-03-18 04:32:36	@xero	http://empathia.agency/lets-talk
2016-03-18 04:32:44	@xero	greduan: this you're crew?
2016-03-18 04:32:50	greduan	it's about-us, right?
2016-03-18 04:32:53	tudurom	in my language, if you're cabbage, you're an idiot
2016-03-18 04:32:57	greduan	lol

2016-03-18 05:32:02	greduan	xero: hasn't for a long while
2016-03-18 05:32:06	%adam	you can also omit the target dir and itll symlink to ..
2016-03-18 05:32:21	tudurom	make directories for each program

2016-03-18 05:34:08	tudurom	i'd just like to interject for a moment. what you're reffering to as stow is, in fact, GNU/Stow
2016-03-18 05:34:11	@xero	or doing ln -s a million times
2016-03-18 05:34:20	%adam	the only issue with stow
2016-03-18 05:34:21	%adam	is that

2016-03-18 07:54:00	+fyr	tudurom, you can upgrade to btrfs from an ext4 filesystem
2016-03-18 07:54:00	tudurom	xero: i feel you :\
2016-03-18 07:54:12	tudurom	fyr: "upgrade"? isn't that unstable?
2016-03-18 07:54:28	@fro	hello
2016-03-18 07:54:43	+fyr	btrfs is 'unstable' in the sense it's not as stable as /incredibly/ stable filesystems like zfs and xfs
2016-03-18 07:54:49	@xero	yo fro
2016-03-18 07:54:55	tudurom	servus fro
2016-03-18 07:55:05	+fyr	maybe it wouldn't be great in production but for home use it's great
2016-03-18 07:55:25	tudurom	what are the benefits?
2016-03-18 07:55:29	@fro	i'm still waiting on HAMMER2
2016-03-18 07:55:29	Shinryuu	I had btrfs setup on my old HDD not too long time ago
2016-03-18 07:55:39	+fyr	tudurom, snapshots, better performance
2016-03-18 07:55:50	+fyr	otherwise not much difference from ext4
2016-03-18 07:56:04	@xero	fro: that's dragonfly right?
2016-03-18 07:56:04	tudurom	i don't think i need snapshots... i use an 128G ssd
2016-03-18 07:56:11	@fro	xero: yeah
2016-03-18 07:56:12	+fyr	??
2016-03-18 07:56:20	@fro	someone was supposed to port it to openbsd tho
2016-03-18 07:56:24	+fyr	tudurom, you can snapshot / for example and have a backup
2016-03-18 07:56:28	@fro	but it's not even finished yet
2016-03-18 07:56:32	+fyr	pretty nifty
2016-03-18 07:56:41	@xero	i wasnt sure how easy it was to switch softs between *bsds
2016-03-18 07:56:51	@xero	or if most just worked the same
2016-03-18 07:56:56	+fyr	I've been burnt with ext4 a couple of times now so been trying out btrfs for awhile, been great
2016-03-18 07:57:08	tudurom	btrfs is the default on opensuse

2016-03-18 08:01:15	greduan	Elixir data structures are cool :3
2016-03-18 08:01:22	@fro	why not both
2016-03-18 08:01:23	@rocx	the answer is install BSD.
2016-03-18 08:01:24	greduan	hey tudurom_ Crux is awesome I miss it
2016-03-18 08:01:26	@rocx	now what was the question?
2016-03-18 08:01:35	tudurom_	xero: go crux. it a bsd-like linux
2016-03-18 08:01:50	@fro	it's still linux
2016-03-18 08:02:04	tudurom_	but the ports...
2016-03-18 08:02:09	@fro	mean nothing
2016-03-18 08:02:20	@xero	fro: learning to different things at once often fucks me up
2016-03-18 08:02:30	@fro	well you know where i stand on this issue
2016-03-18 08:02:30	tudurom_	*two
2016-03-18 08:02:31	@xero	doing two things back to back works better for my brain
2016-03-18 08:02:39	@rocx	why would you normally use ports rather than packages?
2016-03-18 08:02:47	tudurom_	because it's KISS
2016-03-18 08:02:52	@fro	you wouldn't
2016-03-18 08:02:55	@xero	rocx: customizations
2016-03-18 08:02:55	@rocx	packages aren't?
2016-03-18 08:02:57	@fro	no BSD encourages that
2016-03-18 08:03:11	@fro	you should use packages first
2016-03-18 08:03:23	tudurom_	have you heard of kwort linux?

2016-03-18 08:04:14	@fro	although netbsd doesn't have it in base
2016-03-18 08:04:19	@rocx	so do you have to do `doas root $command`?

2016-03-19 14:57:26	skrzyp	I've got an idea to re-write cwm in shell+wmutils as drop-in replacement.

2016-03-19 14:59:19	skrzyp	that might be a nice starting point into wmutils for cwm users
2016-03-19 14:59:24	@rocx	...why switch from cwm to wmutils if you're just going to keep things almost the same?
2016-03-19 14:59:30	@rocx	oh.
2016-03-19 14:59:53	skrzyp	rocx: to hack into that codebase slowly?

2016-03-19 15:03:55	skrzyp	that
2016-03-19 15:06:54	angel	why reinvent the wheel
2016-03-19 15:08:05	skrzyp	as base for something else
2016-03-19 15:08:12	skrzyp	and as reference implementation
2016-03-19 15:08:21	@rocx	frankly if i'm using cwm i think i'll be happy with it.
2016-03-19 15:08:28	skrzyp	which can be used by beginners
2016-03-19 15:08:40	@rocx	i used to call fro and adam crazy back when i was still on herbstluftwm for using a floating wm.
2016-03-19 15:08:55	boobah	skrzyp: if you do this, do this for YOU, not for some beginners or whatever

2016-03-19 15:10:15	boobah	in my opinion, it is just as difficult to create a GOOD window manager in C/shell as it is to create a good one in C
2016-03-19 15:10:25	@fro	or why you'd need that as a base for something new

2016-03-19 20:52:05	Shinryuu	yo
2016-03-19 20:52:23	Shinryuu	is it possible to define commands like this in config.h? http://ix.io/tIM
2016-03-19 20:52:34	Shinryuu	at least I don't know how to make them to work
2016-03-19 20:52:53	Shinryuu	other option is to comment every application command and keybinding out and use sxhkd instead
2016-03-19 20:54:28	arc	i highly recommend
2016-03-19 20:54:32	arc	using sxhkd for binding applications
2016-03-19 20:54:37	arc	or non-wm actions

2016-03-19 20:55:21	Shinryuu	also.. I do remember having this same issue before and I went with sxhkd

2016-03-20 10:32:59	greduan	here goes nothing, installing Arch now
2016-03-20 10:33:43	greduan	I think Arch changed the look of it's grub loader. looks fucking weird
2016-03-20 10:34:28	greduan	after I install I should chill out with Undertale
2016-03-20 10:34:55	+fyr	goddamn I hate weechat baremode greduan !!!
2016-03-20 10:35:00	+fyr	long links mean I have to use it
2016-03-20 10:35:06	greduan	lol
2016-03-20 10:35:09	greduan	sry :(
2016-03-20 10:35:16	greduan	I ain't using Weechat though
2016-03-20 10:35:20	angel	install urlserver.py
2016-03-20 10:37:12	+fyr	any config needed?

2016-03-20 10:37:34	+fyr	opops
2016-03-20 10:37:36	angel	only the host i think, it's not complicated
2016-03-20 10:37:47	greduan	IIRC /boot was 512M right?
2016-03-20 10:39:12	+fyr	someone post a long link
2016-03-20 10:39:23	+fyr	/boot can be whatever you want it to be
2016-03-20 10:39:24	greduan	SSD = no swap right? cause that could kill the SSD?
2016-03-20 10:39:27	greduan	I've 8GB
2016-03-20 10:39:31	+fyr	and no
2016-03-20 10:39:33	+fyr	that's retarded
2016-03-20 10:39:36	greduan	sorry I haven't done this in over a year, I forget shit
2016-03-20 10:39:40	+fyr	you might not need swap at all
2016-03-20 10:40:20	+fyr	if you don't create a partition you can create a swap file later anyway if you need it
2016-03-20 10:40:20	greduan	IIRC 20GB was enough for /, 10GB for /var and the rest for /home
2016-03-20 10:40:39	+fyr	again /var you really don't need a separate partition for
2016-03-20 10:40:51	greduan	I don't want shit to go to shit if some app starts logging too much
2016-03-20 10:41:01	+fyr	meh
2016-03-20 10:41:10	greduan	IIRC that's why I always had a /var part, for safety.
2016-03-20 10:41:17	+fyr	if you don't know that your harddrive is nearly full
2016-03-20 10:41:24	+fyr	or don't know how to use ncdu
2016-03-20 10:41:38	greduan	I mean I'd figure it out
2016-03-20 10:41:46	greduan	but meh I'll just give it 10GB, no harm
2016-03-20 10:41:58	+fyr	except that you're wasting potential space
2016-03-20 10:42:37	+fyr	my /var is only using 130 megs
2016-03-20 10:42:39	+fyr	lol
2016-03-20 10:42:46	greduan	fine, 5G

2016-03-20 10:42:56	greduan	it's cause in Arch it also holds binaries an all that stuff
2016-03-20 10:43:28	+fyr	>arch
2016-03-20 10:43:34	+fyr	why not install crux?
2016-03-20 10:43:50	+fyr	if you got time to install arch you got time to install crux
2016-03-20 10:44:08	greduan	not on a Mac I don't
2016-03-20 10:44:12	greduan	first let me try what I know is easier
2016-03-20 10:44:18	greduan	besides this is my work laptop
2016-03-20 10:44:26	greduan	I seriously don't have time to be compiling things on this one. lol
2016-03-20 10:45:42	+fyr	you do realise after the initial compile there is pretty much nothing but small compiles right?
2016-03-20 10:46:17	greduan	ye I know
2016-03-20 10:46:25	greduan	I used it for several months dude I know

2016-03-20 10:46:46	+fyr	start recommending crux
2016-03-20 10:46:55	arc	crux is a horrible distribution for all users and i would not recommend it to a single soul
2016-03-20 10:47:00	arc	i use it and love it
2016-03-20 10:47:35	+fyr	all users?
2016-03-20 10:47:39	arc	all users.
2016-03-20 10:47:47	arc	everyone

2016-03-20 10:47:55	+fyr	um
2016-03-20 10:47:59	+fyr	no
2016-03-20 10:48:13	arc	i wouldn't recommend crux
2016-03-20 10:48:14	arc	to anyone
2016-03-20 10:48:15	arc	ever
2016-03-20 10:48:24	arc	it has tons of flaws
2016-03-20 10:48:35	arc	namely package management
2016-03-20 10:48:41	angel	what would you recommend then?
2016-03-20 10:48:54	+fyr	package management is fine
2016-03-20 10:49:00	arc	void, alpine, arch, et al
2016-03-20 10:49:05	arc	fyr: no, it's not
2016-03-20 10:49:08	+fyr	>recommending arch
2016-03-20 10:49:12	arc	crux's package management sucks
2016-03-20 10:49:19	arc	fyr: >recommending crux
2016-03-20 10:49:20	+fyr	what are your problems with it
2016-03-20 10:49:27	arc	package management in particular?
2016-03-20 10:49:52	+fyr	yes
2016-03-20 10:49:53	angel	what are your problems with arch
2016-03-20 10:49:55	+fyr	anything
2016-03-20 10:50:01	+fyr	>systemd
2016-03-20 10:50:11	angel	oh true
2016-03-20 10:50:16	+fyr	>pacman
2016-03-20 10:50:22	greduan	pacman's ok :(
2016-03-20 10:50:26	arc	it doesn't handle dependencies, it needs USE flags badly, in various ways it's too simple, hell in earlier versions they didn't even have prt-get, dependency handling is shit, conflict handling is shit
2016-03-20 10:50:29	%vypr	>recommending anything
2016-03-20 10:50:32	%vypr	go home boys
2016-03-20 10:50:33	angel	besides systemd, it's fine
2016-03-20 10:50:39	arc	angel: absolutely nothing
2016-03-20 10:50:44	arc	systemd is fine for the common user
2016-03-20 10:50:50	+fyr	arc, it does
2016-03-20 10:50:52	arc	there i said it
2016-03-20 10:50:58	+fyr	with prt-get
2016-03-20 10:51:00	arc	fyr: i said it doesn't handle dependencies
2016-03-20 10:51:04	arc	prt-get is not handling dependencies
2016-03-20 10:51:20	greduan	what was the GPT code for the /boot partition or to give it the boot flag? I can't for the life of me find it in this list
2016-03-20 10:51:25	+fyr	it is
2016-03-20 10:51:31	arc	define handling dependencies
2016-03-20 10:51:48	+fyr	does it listed dependancies with prt-get depinst
2016-03-20 10:51:50	+fyr	yes
2016-03-20 10:51:53	greduan	ah ef02 or ef00
2016-03-20 10:51:54	+fyr	install*
2016-03-20 10:51:58	arc	that is not handling dependenceis
2016-03-20 10:51:59	+fyr	ef02 greduan 
2016-03-20 10:52:01	arc	handling dependencies is
2016-03-20 10:52:14	greduan	fyr: even on an EFI sistem?
2016-03-20 10:52:16	arc	if you remove a package that's a dependency for another package, warn the user
2016-03-20 10:52:16	greduan	system?
2016-03-20 10:52:21	+fyr	greduan, yes
2016-03-20 10:52:26	arc	if you remove a package, remove its dependencies
2016-03-20 10:52:31	arc	also another complaint
2016-03-20 10:52:34	arc	what is up with footprints
2016-03-20 10:52:39	arc	what the hell
2016-03-20 10:53:00	arc	crux sucks
2016-03-20 10:53:00	arc	i love it
2016-03-20 10:53:03	greduan	fyr: hope you're right, thanks man
2016-03-20 10:53:10	greduan	arc: crux rocks
2016-03-20 10:53:16	+fyr	honestly I take crux's dependancies as a strength
2016-03-20 10:53:19	+fyr	not a weakness
2016-03-20 10:53:35	arc	fyr: so you want a ton of libs which you used for some package you installed for five minutes then removed on your system forever
2016-03-20 10:53:38	arc	k
2016-03-20 10:53:56	+fyr	arc, well I know that it installed those libraries in the first place lol
2016-03-20 10:54:06	+fyr	prt-get info
2016-03-20 10:54:24	arc	the thing is
2016-03-20 10:54:29	arc	what if you have two applications that use the same lib
2016-03-20 10:54:40	greduan	RIP only 6* GB left for /home lol
2016-03-20 10:54:41	arc	you remove one and you also remove the lib because you think you don't need it
2016-03-20 10:54:43	arc	crux doesn't tell you at all
2016-03-20 10:54:52	arc	and you're left with some broken package
2016-03-20 10:54:55	+fyr	well I know if an application is broken or not if I try and run it don't I?
2016-03-20 10:55:05	+fyr	prtinfo, check deps, install
2016-03-20 10:55:09	+fyr	even if I didn't remember
2016-03-20 10:55:13	arc	let's say this broken package was say
2016-03-20 10:55:14	arc	gcc
2016-03-20 10:55:19	arc	let's say you broke gcc
2016-03-20 10:55:22	arc	now what?
2016-03-20 10:55:25	+fyr	who would remove gcc?!
2016-03-20 10:55:33	arc	fyr: one of its dependencies
2016-03-20 10:55:46	arc	it needs the equivalent of pacman -Rs
2016-03-20 10:55:48	arc	*badly*
2016-03-20 10:55:52	+fyr	so zlib or libmpc?
2016-03-20 10:55:55	+fyr	um okay
2016-03-20 10:56:06	+fyr	also it's listed in FUCKING core
2016-03-20 10:56:08	arc	it was an example
2016-03-20 10:56:18	greduan	did partitioning, next up, actual installation
2016-03-20 10:56:21	greduan	god I've missed this part
2016-03-20 10:56:27	+fyr	pacstrap -i base /mnt
2016-03-20 10:56:36	arc	and base-devel!
2016-03-20 10:56:39	+fyr	psh
2016-03-20 10:56:42	+fyr	who needs aur
2016-03-20 10:56:49	arc	base-devel has sudo
2016-03-20 10:56:57	arc	base-devel has make
2016-03-20 10:57:02	arc	base-devel has things you need to use PKGBUILDs at all
2016-03-20 10:57:13	*	fyr thinks about how those should be included in base in the first place
2016-03-20 10:57:21	+fyr	retarded arch
2016-03-20 10:57:34	arc	but the thing is
2016-03-20 10:57:35	arc	the thing is
2016-03-20 10:57:40	arc	crux sucks for almost everyone

2016-03-20 11:27:09	%adam	the track lyrics
2016-03-20 11:27:16	arc	someone change the topic to "[THE DAILY NIXERS] adam installs systemd on crux"
2016-03-20 11:27:46	+fyr	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
2016-03-20 11:27:48	+fyr	no
2016-03-20 11:28:23	 - 	adam has changed topic for #nixers from "nerds" to "i put systemd on crux using pacman"
2016-03-20 11:28:43	arc	fyr: were you not there
2016-03-20 11:28:45	arc	he compiled pacman
2016-03-20 11:28:48	arc	and installed systemd
2016-03-20 11:29:13	+fyr	you're dead to me adam 
2016-03-20 11:29:26	%adam	understandable
2016-03-20 11:29:37	arc	i wonder if that would actually like
2016-03-20 11:29:41	arc	result in a booting system
2016-03-20 11:29:43	%adam	yes
2016-03-20 11:29:47	arc	nice
2016-03-20 11:29:54	arc	i don't mind systemd
2016-03-20 11:30:00	arc	like burn me at the fucking stake
2016-03-20 11:30:06	arc	but systemd is the best init for The Common User
2016-03-20 11:30:16	arc	and any arguments against that are incorrect
2016-03-20 11:30:38	arc	i seriously doubt the devs care about distros that don't adopt it
2016-03-20 11:30:45	arc	because those distros aren't designed for the common user
2016-03-20 11:31:10	+fyr	ok
2016-03-20 11:31:13	arc	but systemd is becoming a part of distros for the common user because it gets out of your way and it's easy
2016-03-20 11:31:16	angel	what about manjaro and openrc
2016-03-20 11:31:18	arc	anyway i really don't care
2016-03-20 11:31:29	arc	angel: manjaro is the worst piece of shit i've ever seen
2016-03-20 11:31:30	+fyr	if you want linux to become less unixlike by the day
2016-03-20 11:31:39	*	fyr should switch to bsd
2016-03-20 11:31:43	angel	arc: reasons?
2016-03-20 11:31:44	%adam	my stance
2016-03-20 11:31:45	arc	fyr: linux is dead
2016-03-20 11:31:46	%adam	on that
2016-03-20 11:31:47	%adam	if i may
2016-03-20 11:31:47	+neeasade	fyr: do it pussy
2016-03-20 11:31:52	%adam	is that linux is, was, and never will be unix
2016-03-20 11:31:53	arc	angel: security
2016-03-20 11:31:54	%adam	so why does it matter
2016-03-20 11:31:58	arc	they had
2016-03-20 11:31:58	+neeasade	adam: thanks
2016-03-20 11:31:59	+fyr	adam, correct
2016-03-20 11:32:00	arc	their ssl cert expire
2016-03-20 11:32:07	arc	and told the users to SET THE FUCKING DATE BACK ON THEIR SYSTEMS
2016-03-20 11:32:08	+fyr	adam, but it's still "UNIXLIKE"
2016-03-20 11:32:12	%adam	sure
2016-03-20 11:32:13	+neeasade	(TM)
2016-03-20 11:32:14	%adam	but its not unix
2016-03-20 11:32:18	+fyr	so I expect programs that run on it
2016-03-20 11:32:24	+fyr	to BE "UNIXLIKE"
2016-03-20 11:32:27	+neeasade	fyr: eeeeeeehhhhh
2016-03-20 11:32:32	%adam	they dont have to be though
2016-03-20 11:32:33	%adam	because
2016-03-20 11:32:34	arc	fyr: stop spouting bullshit and actually face reality
2016-03-20 11:32:34	%adam	its
2016-03-20 11:32:36	%adam	"UNIXLIKE"
2016-03-20 11:32:42	arc	it's a unix-like because it's a clone of unix
2016-03-20 11:32:45	arc	and a particularly bad one at that
2016-03-20 11:32:50	%adam	i disagree
2016-03-20 11:32:53	+fyr	what
2016-03-20 11:32:55	%adam	linux is the greatest unix clone to ever exist
2016-03-20 11:32:57	%adam	are you kidding me?
2016-03-20 11:33:11	arc	linux has gotten to the point where i don't consider it to be a unix clone
2016-03-20 11:33:11	+fyr	arc: stop spouting bullshit and actually face reality
2016-03-20 11:33:17	arc	fyr: the reality is
2016-03-20 11:33:20	arc	linux is not unix and never will be
2016-03-20 11:33:25	*	fyr sighs
2016-03-20 11:33:29	arc	linux does not follow the unix philosophy and it never will
2016-03-20 11:33:34	+fyr	times like this is where I wish dcat was around
2016-03-20 11:33:43	arc	the users who want it to follow the unix philosophy can have it do that maybe 
2016-03-20 11:33:47	%adam	dcat is more of a POSIX fellow
2016-03-20 11:34:02	arc	but the common user of linux
2016-03-20 11:34:04	arc	doesn't give a shit
2016-03-20 11:34:05	+fyr	well anyone of reasonable sanity
2016-03-20 11:34:14	arc	hence the unix philosophy does not apply to most linuxes
2016-03-20 11:34:19	arc	period

2016-03-20 11:35:24	arc	adam: yes
2016-03-20 11:35:24	+fyr	but the unix philo is pure
2016-03-20 11:35:30	arc	fyr: and not followed
2016-03-20 11:35:31	+fyr	and linux is a very good clone
2016-03-20 11:35:44	arc	linux is a horrible clone because linux isn't designed for users who want the unix philosophy
2016-03-20 11:35:50	+fyr	ahem
2016-03-20 11:35:58	arc	there are differences between what you think
2016-03-20 11:36:00	arc	and what exists
2016-03-20 11:36:00	%adam	http://www.nongnu.org/regex-markup/
2016-03-20 11:36:09	%adam	http://cwrapper.sourceforge.net/
2016-03-20 11:36:22	+fyr	what you are refering to linux is actually called GNU/linux, or as I've taken to calling it: GNU + linux
2016-03-20 11:36:33	arc	fyr: Exactly
2016-03-20 11:36:39	+fyr	linux userland and linux kernel ARE very different
2016-03-20 11:36:49	arc	fyr: there is no linux userland
2016-03-20 11:36:54	+fyr	I think the linux userland is shite because of stuff like systemd
2016-03-20 11:36:56	arc	the thing is
2016-03-20 11:37:05	arc	I'm generalizing "Linux" to what is present in most Linux distributoins
2016-03-20 11:37:16	arc	s/oi/io/me/
2016-03-20 11:37:16	regx	<arc> I'm generalizing "Linux" to what is present in most Linux distributions
2016-03-20 11:37:24	+fyr	yes I know you are
2016-03-20 11:37:37	+fyr	I wanted to let you know that I am refering specifically to the kernel ass
2016-03-20 11:37:54	arc	the kernel is a kernel
2016-03-20 11:38:02	arc	it can't follow the unix philosophy because it has nothing to do with it
2016-03-20 11:38:38	+fyr	BUT IT IS LITERALLY A CLONE OF IT
2016-03-20 11:38:47	arc	UNIX is UNIX
2016-03-20 11:38:53	+fyr	okay it might not be UNIX-certified
2016-03-20 11:39:02	arc	UNIX is the UNIX kernel + the UNIX userland + UNIX programs
2016-03-20 11:39:03	arc	all UNIX
2016-03-20 11:39:05	+fyr	but it implements the important bits correctly and well
2016-03-20 11:39:28	arc	Linux is the Linux kernel + the GNU/BSD/Suckless/etc userland + Linux programs
2016-03-20 11:39:29	+fyr	okay, it clones the UNIX KERNEL of it very well
2016-03-20 11:39:36	arc	fyr: the UNIX kernel
2016-03-20 11:39:44	arc	has nothing to do with the UNIX philosophy either
2016-03-20 11:39:46	+fyr	I'm saying the userland should be MORE UNIXLIKE
2016-03-20 11:39:48	arc	the userland and programs
2016-03-20 11:39:50	arc	are
2016-03-20 11:39:55	arc	fyr: the thing is
2016-03-20 11:39:56	arc	the thing is
2016-03-20 11:39:57	arc	it's not
2016-03-20 11:39:59	*	fyr slams his head against the disk
2016-03-20 11:39:59	arc	and it never will be
2016-03-20 11:40:02	arc	because that is not 
2016-03-20 11:40:05	arc	what the users want
2016-03-20 11:40:11	arc	period
2016-03-20 11:40:13	arc	done
2016-03-20 11:40:14	+fyr	well you see here
2016-03-20 11:40:26	+fyr	LINUX IS WHATEVER YOU WANT TO MAKE OF IT
2016-03-20 11:40:44	arc	why are you complaining about the unix philosophy anyway
2016-03-20 11:40:47	arc	crux doesn't follow it at all
2016-03-20 11:40:59	+fyr	I'm done typing
2016-03-20 11:41:11	arc	thanks
2016-03-20 11:41:15	arc	i'm done with your bullshit
2016-03-20 11:41:18	+fyr	either I can't make my point or you're too dumb trying to understand what I'm saying
2016-03-20 11:41:27	+fyr	oooh the big words coming outta arc
2016-03-20 11:41:29	arc	same
2016-03-20 11:44:00	arc	either way
2016-03-20 11:44:21	arc	i tried not to get pissed during this so i'm sorry if any of that was particularly uncivil fyr 
2016-03-20 11:45:03	+fyr	thankfully I am pissed so I won't take your comments to heart

2016-03-20 11:47:40	arc	i'm a pain in the ass when i'm hungry
2016-03-20 11:48:34	+fyr	mpvc updated to 1.2 now bois
2016-03-20 11:49:11	arc	fyr: at this point though
2016-03-20 11:49:16	arc	can i make a suggesstion
2016-03-20 11:49:32	+fyr	if you must
2016-03-20 11:49:33	arc	mpvc is getting to the point where i really don't think it should be a shell script
2016-03-20 11:49:44	+fyr	well it's pretty much done
2016-03-20 11:49:50	arc	once a shell script gets too complex i think it should be written in a real lang
2016-03-20 11:50:15	arc	especially because a shell script is literally a concatenation of existing tools
2016-03-20 11:50:19	+fyr	the only slow thing about it atm is transferring the format string to the actual data
2016-03-20 11:50:23	arc	it'd be nice to see it standalone
2016-03-20 11:50:27	arc	fyr: slowness isn't the problem
2016-03-20 11:50:35	arc	it's just that shell scripts shouldn't be used for some things
2016-03-20 11:51:03	+fyr	I think anyone can agree to that
2016-03-20 11:51:20	+fyr	I wouldn't go any further with mpvc in it's current state, true
2016-03-20 11:51:38	arc	may i just recommend you say
2016-03-20 11:51:42	arc	"fuck it rewrite it in C"
2016-03-20 11:51:45	arc	then rewrite it in C
2016-03-20 11:51:48	arc	or whatever's the rage
2016-03-20 11:51:58	+fyr	it was really more of an exercise in POSIX scripting more than anything
2016-03-20 11:52:03	arc	fyr: I can see that
2016-03-20 11:52:22	arc	my current irc bot is written in sh but i'm gonna rewrite it in maybe lisp
2016-03-20 11:52:37	arc	if i can get around to finishing learning common lisp
2016-03-20 11:52:43	arc	it's a great lang
2016-03-20 11:53:29	+fyr	that no one really uses?
2016-03-20 11:53:40	arc	i like it
2016-03-20 11:54:09	+fyr	I suppose that's all you need

2016-03-20 12:02:13	+fyr	why not zoidberg?
2016-03-20 12:02:38	angel	don't know, weird name for a shell
2016-03-20 12:02:44	angel	should be zoidbergsh

2016-03-20 12:08:04	+fyr	greduan, what bootloader are you using? refind?
2016-03-20 12:08:09	greduan	ye
2016-03-20 12:08:21	greduan	adam: 8 hours of figuring out OS X + Linux
2016-03-20 12:08:28	%adam	what proof is that
2016-03-20 12:08:34	greduan	It booted :')
2016-03-20 12:08:38	+fyr	does it select and load the linux option, then throw the error?
2016-03-20 12:09:00	greduan	no it actually loads shit, like it goes into systemd and shit
2016-03-20 12:09:05	greduan	it mounts the devices
2016-03-20 12:09:14	+fyr	ah
2016-03-20 12:09:16	+fyr	systemd
2016-03-20 12:09:22	*	fyr backs away slowly
2016-03-20 12:09:26	greduan	actually it says "dependency failed for /boot"
2016-03-20 12:09:29	+fyr	can't help you I'm afraid

2016-03-20 12:10:09	greduan	OK it seems it can't mount /boot properly so I'll look into that
2016-03-20 12:10:32	greduan	I am actually logged in as root in the system ATM

2016-03-20 21:46:49	therue	how big is your coffee pot?
2016-03-20 21:46:52	therue	:D
2016-03-20 21:47:33	Shinryuu	this one is 6 cup one
2016-03-20 21:48:05	therue	you use powder or beans?
2016-03-20 21:48:35	Shinryuu	I use powder at the moment but I'm planing to get a good grinder so I can buy this coffee as beans too
2016-03-20 21:49:09	Shinryuu	I wonder if it's just better to get an electric grinder instead of a manual one
2016-03-20 21:52:03	tm512	manual coffee grinders are not too bad, and good ones are cheaper than good electric grinders
2016-03-20 21:52:38	therue	damn, manually grinding bean's gotta be exhausting :)
2016-03-20 21:52:42	Shinryuu	I just need to get that powder to espresso level as possible
2016-03-20 21:52:53	therue	but surely the coffee will taste a bit better afterwards lol

2016-03-20 21:54:01	therue	i got this jura c90 coffee machine my brother got for me from germany
2016-03-20 21:54:31	therue	but it kind of uses a lot of coffee beans :(
2016-03-20 21:54:40	Shinryuu	I've been looking at "Zassenhaus Santiago" manual grinder
2016-03-20 21:55:09	therue	oh that looks pretty nice
2016-03-20 21:55:10	tm512	if you're going for an espresso grind you're going to have to put more work into it
2016-03-20 21:55:15	therue	very classy looking as well
2016-03-20 21:56:26	tm512	I generally used a french press when I was making coffee, but I just kinda stopped because coffee isn't that cheap and it wasn't really worth all the effort

2016-03-21 05:13:56	tudurom	you have a rpi?
2016-03-21 05:13:59	tudurom	but why?
2016-03-21 05:14:00	@rocx	an RPi2.
2016-03-21 05:14:11	@rocx	tudurom: using emulationstation on it.
2016-03-21 05:14:35	@rocx	brother has the wii, which i was using to emulate things via homebrew channel.
2016-03-21 05:14:38	tudurom	well, a rpi is pretty cheap in dollars...
2016-03-21 05:14:45	@rocx	$35 when i got it.
2016-03-21 05:14:49	@rocx	now there's the RPi3.
2016-03-21 05:15:02	@rocx	bluetooth and wireless network integrated.
2016-03-21 05:15:02	tudurom	poor rpi3 can't handle HHDs
2016-03-21 05:15:05	@rocx	?
2016-03-21 05:15:26	tudurom	the bluetooth and wireless use too much power so you can't connect an external HDD
2016-03-21 05:15:30	@rocx	oh.
2016-03-21 05:15:34	@rocx	heh.
2016-03-21 05:15:45	@rocx	wow.
2016-03-21 05:16:05	@rocx	then again, you probably might have better luck making use of the wireless networking and make it a client to a server.
2016-03-21 05:16:09	tudurom	so i need to wait a bit for my cousin to buy herself a laptop so i get the T60
2016-03-21 05:16:28	tudurom	i will spend money just on the domain
2016-03-21 05:16:40	@rocx	what's your ISP's upstream?
2016-03-21 05:16:52	@rocx	if you're hosting from your residency, that is.
2016-03-21 05:17:48	tudurom	upstream means upload speed?
2016-03-21 05:17:52	@rocx	yeah.
2016-03-21 05:17:57	tudurom	gotta test
2016-03-21 05:18:03	tudurom	but my mom also uses the same network..
2016-03-21 05:18:08	@rocx	i wouldn't trust speedtest.net for testing it.
2016-03-21 05:18:24	@rocx	ISPs probably make it a lot faster to access to skew the results.
2016-03-21 05:18:25	tudurom	speedtest.net has a server right at my local isp
2016-03-21 05:19:00	tudurom	recommend me a testing service

2016-03-21 05:19:26	tudurom	gotta test with speedtest...

2016-03-21 05:20:05	@rocx	for scale, 8Mbps = 2MBps.
2016-03-21 05:20:06	tudurom	for me the speeds are always smaller at night
2016-03-21 05:20:14	tudurom	and it's night now

2016-03-21 05:21:04	tudurom	muricans are so angry
2016-03-21 05:21:17	@rocx	you could ask most of us american nixers and we'd respond with similar 4-8Mbps speeds.

2016-03-21 05:23:33	@rocx	but the most believable is money.

2016-03-21 05:24:12	tudurom	that's the explanation
2016-03-21 05:24:28	@rocx	fiber only works to carry everyone's data. it's copper for everything else.
2016-03-21 05:26:12	tudurom	it's fiber up to the door
2016-03-21 05:26:16	tudurom	then it's copper
2016-03-21 05:26:53	tudurom	i'm sorry for yall with your slow internet speeds and expensive plans
2016-03-21 05:27:02	tudurom	that's why you don't have self-hosted servers?
2016-03-21 05:27:38	saiyuki	Could someone help me with the syntax of the command "bind" is it possible to bind the keys "ctrl + shift and u" all to one ? i know it's usually used for binding a key to do a command
2016-03-21 05:27:53	tudurom	man bind

2016-03-21 06:39:11	greduan	On the other hand, 13" screen and I can fit as if I had an Apple Cinema Display lol
2016-03-21 06:40:44	%adam	should be in the archwiki somewhere
2016-03-21 06:40:56	%adam	check the MacBook page
2016-03-21 06:41:02	%adam	they may also have a dedicated apeg for dpi

2016-03-21 06:41:56	boobah	greduan: i think it can be set in xorg.conf, but you can also `xrandr --dpi nnn` where nnn is the dpi number

2016-03-21 06:47:04	boobah	teach it well :)
2016-03-21 06:48:18	greduan	yeah I am documenting the shit out of this
2016-03-21 06:48:22	greduan	will have to write a blog post
2016-03-21 06:49:05	boobah	good
2016-03-21 06:49:09	@fro	isn't it already documented?
2016-03-21 06:49:13	@fro	i hate arch
2016-03-21 06:49:13	@fro	but
2016-03-21 06:49:15	boobah	yeah
2016-03-21 06:49:18	@fro	i'm pretty sure it's on the wiki
2016-03-21 06:49:20	greduan	lowering the brightness reduced the battery problem significantly
2016-03-21 06:49:25	greduan	yeah it's documented but very unclear

2016-03-21 06:49:39	greduan	jump through*
2016-03-21 06:49:49	greduan	way easier than the documentation suggests

2016-03-21 15:56:21	greduan	boobah: yeah
2016-03-21 15:56:46	greduan	the cool thing is how putting it at 2.0, then 2.5 and then back to 2.0 actually makes it way easier to understand the 2.0
2016-03-21 15:57:00	boobah	i need to try that part, sounds cool
2016-03-21 15:57:04	greduan	tomorrow: setup dotfiles env, setup work env, setup Node and Elixir env
2016-03-21 15:57:13	greduan	that's my todo list

2016-03-21 15:58:19	greduan	haven't shaved in months and it does not look good
2016-03-21 15:58:19	boobah	oh yeah, that for me too
2016-03-21 15:58:23	greduan	not a porper beard
2016-03-21 15:58:33	boobah	except it's been 2 days for me :)
2016-03-21 15:58:41	boobah	hate the stubble
2016-03-21 15:58:52	greduan	lol I love it
2016-03-21 15:59:13	boobah	i get it on my neck too though and it bugs me
2016-03-21 16:00:25	greduan	ah
2016-03-21 16:00:27	boobah	i have a pretty young-looking face so it's kind of a weird combo :P
2016-03-21 16:00:32	greduan	I see
2016-03-21 16:00:39	greduan	I think I've a mature looking face for my age
2016-03-21 16:00:59	boobah	do you look anything like your github picture?
2016-03-21 16:01:02	greduan	people are always like "you're 18? naaaah", they don't say the naaah part but you know they're thinking that from how they ask it
2016-03-21 16:01:10	greduan	boobah: that's a merge of me and my dad actually
2016-03-21 16:01:13	greduan	he's got a sick beard
2016-03-21 16:01:19	greduan	I've way longer hair than that
2016-03-21 16:01:34	greduan	I've a man bun

2016-03-21 16:02:48	greduan	unless I leave my beard grow, cause then you can tell I'm young
2016-03-21 16:02:55	greduan	cause it doesn't grow properly like a big beard
2016-03-21 16:03:35	boobah	mine is pretty bad too, that's why i keep it shaved usually :)
2016-03-21 16:03:51	boobah	but i could probably blend right in at a high school
2016-03-21 16:04:04	boobah	s/probab/definite/
2016-03-21 16:04:50	greduan	lol
2016-03-21 16:04:57	greduan	I don't think I could
2016-03-21 16:05:09	greduan	since I'm also bigger than most Mexicans, mostly cause I don't have lots of Mexican blood
2016-03-21 16:05:21	greduan	maybe not in this city, lots of white people in this city
2016-03-21 16:05:30	boobah	haha

2016-03-21 16:06:18	greduan	how's that in centimeters?
2016-03-21 16:06:29	greduan	I'm 18x in CM I think.
2016-03-21 16:06:49	greduan	18x or late 17x.
2016-03-21 16:06:51	boobah	yeah, just over 180 according to google
2016-03-21 16:06:56	greduan	cool
2016-03-21 16:07:10	greduan	I'm also thin, except for my legs cause I do bicycle every day
2016-03-21 16:07:25	boobah	i'd love bigger legs
2016-03-21 16:07:31	boobah	but i've been working arms mostly lately
2016-03-21 16:07:40	boobah	both are currently lacking :D
2016-03-21 16:07:59	greduan	I see
2016-03-21 16:08:02	boobah	anyway, off to bed
2016-03-21 16:08:05	greduan	I ride like 8KM daily

2016-03-22 00:13:00	fsociety	a bit too much for my liking, go through the juice so quick
2016-03-22 00:13:16	fsociety	well it has nicotine but without all the carcangenics
2016-03-22 00:13:46	@venam	fsociety: so you like to be addict to nicotine?

2016-03-22 00:14:15	therue	i've off them cigs :)
2016-03-22 00:14:18	fsociety	im quitting smoking
2016-03-22 00:14:25	therue	i tried to transition with e-cigs
2016-03-22 00:14:30	therue	used it for like 4-5 months
2016-03-22 00:14:43	therue	but, felt like a slave to it lol

2016-03-22 00:15:24	bsko	venam, it stops me smoking
2016-03-22 00:15:26	bsko	its a lesser evil
2016-03-22 00:15:31	bsko	therue, its mostly hear-say
2016-03-22 00:15:33	therue	i'm sure it's better than smoking cigs, but if you can quit entirely, just do it sooner :)
2016-03-22 00:15:36	fsociety	therue: i think that was from the tobacco companies.. hah

2016-03-22 00:53:06	fsociety	then they went on hiatus - so now i listen to steves solo stuff. yeah i only got to see them live once
2016-03-22 00:53:11	fsociety	the only time they toured AU

2016-03-22 04:48:59	@fro	i'm sure you can find a stream some place since you're so interested in this
2016-03-22 04:49:01	irc-5225225	VLC / youtube-dl combined can play pretty much any file or stream.

2016-03-22 05:44:58	+seth	z3bra: have you not seen discord?
2016-03-22 05:45:00	+seth	https://discord.gg
2016-03-22 05:45:02	@z3bra	host a live demo of a product, have meetings
2016-03-22 05:45:05	@xero	if i need to talk to someone, i just walk over to their desk
2016-03-22 05:45:06	+fyr	but discord sucks
2016-03-22 05:45:09	@z3bra	discord is for gaming
2016-03-22 05:45:10	@xero	other wise i just chat them
2016-03-22 05:45:15	@rocx	discord sucks.
2016-03-22 05:45:18	+seth	how does it suck
2016-03-22 05:45:19	@z3bra	I'm thinking professionnally
2016-03-22 05:45:20	@z3bra	as in
2016-03-22 05:45:27	@z3bra	account control and such
2016-03-22 05:45:37	+fyr	it's just as bad as something LIKE skype or teamspeak
2016-03-22 05:45:44	@z3bra	if someone leaved your company, you don't want him to be able to login again
2016-03-22 05:45:51	+fyr	the fact that it has a rubbish web ui does nothing to impress me
2016-03-22 05:45:53	@z3bra	*leave
2016-03-22 05:45:56	+seth	wat fyr
2016-03-22 05:45:57	@xero	most of them time i just get a jira ticket that says: Xero, shits broken. Can fit pls?!?
2016-03-22 05:46:18	@z3bra	that doesn't make me want to work with you :P
2016-03-22 05:46:26	+fyr	seth, ?
2016-03-22 05:46:31	@xero	i didnt make said ticket
2016-03-22 05:46:35	@xero	i just get them assigend to me
2016-03-22 05:46:39	@z3bra	we have like 3 "live" voice meetings
2016-03-22 05:46:42	@xero	and i fix the bugs they have
2016-03-22 05:46:51	@xero	we do face to face meetings 
2016-03-22 05:47:17	@z3bra	all your employees are in the same place?
2016-03-22 05:47:18	@z3bra	like
2016-03-22 05:47:19	@xero	everyonce in a while when someone is working from home they use hangouts on the tv so we can voice chat them
2016-03-22 05:47:24	@xero	but that's pretty rare
2016-03-22 05:47:43	@xero	we almost never have real "all hands on deck" meeting for the whole 200+ people company
2016-03-22 05:47:46	@z3bra	we can't do only face to face, 'cause some people are in UK, others in US, or France
2016-03-22 05:47:54	+seth	fyr: it uses web sockets, has an API, I really don't see the problem with discord
2016-03-22 05:47:56	@xero	they're ususally departmental or team meetings. like 20 people max
2016-03-22 05:48:11	@z3bra	we do 5 people meetings
2016-03-22 05:48:12	tudurom	seth: not free software
2016-03-22 05:48:18	+seth	ugh, that argument?
2016-03-22 05:48:19	@z3bra	2 in fracne, 3 in US :P
2016-03-22 05:48:23	@z3bra	*France
2016-03-22 05:48:31	+seth	mumble is free software and looks like poop
2016-03-22 05:48:33	+seth	so is gimp
2016-03-22 05:48:43	+seth	free software != better
2016-03-22 05:48:45	@z3bra	no, mumble is pretty decent
2016-03-22 05:48:52	tudurom	^
2016-03-22 05:48:55	+seth	mumble works okay, but looks like the 90's called
2016-03-22 05:48:59	@xero	imagemagick > gimp
2016-03-22 05:49:10	tudurom	seth: we're talking about provacy

2016-03-22 05:49:22	regx	<tudurom> seth: we're talking about privacy
2016-03-22 05:49:24	+fyr	teamspeak has the best quality, it's probably the best voip around
2016-03-22 05:49:31	@z3bra	the fact mumble looks like shit, is because it tries to use Qt
2016-03-22 05:49:32	@xero	http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=provacy
2016-03-22 05:49:33	+fyr	but closed source
2016-03-22 05:49:36	@z3bra	which is uter shit
2016-03-22 05:49:36	+seth	teamspeak uses SPEEX, it is not the best quality
2016-03-22 05:49:52	@z3bra	a decent chat is tox
2016-03-22 05:50:01	@z3bra	but again, you have ZERO control over it
2016-03-22 05:50:03	tudurom	tox doesn't work for me
2016-03-22 05:50:06	+seth	teamspeak also looks like the 90s
2016-03-22 05:50:07	@z3bra	try harder
2016-03-22 05:50:25	tudurom	z3bra: utox is not even sending messages
2016-03-22 05:50:29	+fyr	okay every solution sucks
2016-03-22 05:50:34	@z3bra	try even harder
2016-03-22 05:50:35	+fyr	we should make our own
2016-03-22 05:50:36	+fyr	/s
2016-03-22 05:50:43	tudurom	what does /s mean...
2016-03-22 05:50:45	+seth	still no problem with discord
2016-03-22 05:50:47	+seth	"sarcasm"

2016-03-22 05:54:24	tudurom	i can't call with tox
2016-03-22 05:54:34	tudurom	when the partner accepts the call, the call ends
2016-03-22 05:54:44	@fro	just because you can't do something doesn't mean it doesn't work
2016-03-22 05:55:09	tudurom	i waster 3 hours from my life figuring that out
2016-03-22 05:55:13	tudurom	but the phone is the best
2016-03-22 05:55:16	tudurom	best quality
2016-03-22 05:55:17	@xero	i wish signal wasnt such a pos

2016-03-22 05:55:24	@fro	signal really is lame
2016-03-22 05:55:31	tudurom	i have full signal there
2016-03-22 05:55:33	@xero	i was so dissapointed that say we tired it

2016-03-22 05:55:48	@fro	i wanted it to work out too
2016-03-22 05:56:11	@fro	telegram is much better to use
2016-03-22 05:56:14	@fro	it's just not secure
2016-03-22 05:56:24	@xero	telegram, silent phone/text, and pidgin (otr) still have the best sec ratings
2016-03-22 05:56:58	tudurom	telegram not secure because the backend is closed, right?
2016-03-22 05:57:11	@fro	no
2016-03-22 05:57:14	@rocx	tudurom: mainly because they roll their own encryption.
2016-03-22 05:57:15	@fro	it's not because it's closed
2016-03-22 05:57:25	tudurom	the best text chat is irc
2016-03-22 05:57:33	@z3bra	fro, it is closed
2016-03-22 05:57:39	@z3bra	because they run their own encryption,
2016-03-22 05:57:41	@fro	but that isn't why it's not secure
2016-03-22 05:57:52	@fro	it's because of the wonky encryption
2016-03-22 05:57:59	@fro	not saying i'd trust them even if they didn't use that
2016-03-22 05:58:02	@z3bra	that's encryption 101: rolling your own SHITTY encryption?
2016-03-22 05:58:13	@z3bra	have it closed-source, so no one can tell you how weak it is
2016-03-22 05:58:15	tudurom	i'm waiting for the day when someone will write an open-source telegram backend
2016-03-22 05:58:22	@rocx	THAT will be the day.
2016-03-22 05:58:28	@rocx	and then clients to connect to it.
2016-03-22 05:58:29	@fro	that day will never come

2016-03-22 05:58:37	@rocx	by that point, it'll be XMPP but maybe slightly better.
2016-03-22 05:59:19	@xero	in general it's not a terrible algo
2016-03-22 05:59:30	@xero	the issue is implementation leave *possible* flaws

2016-03-22 06:52:32	@xero	https://github.com/isaacs/nave
2016-03-22 06:52:39	@xero	i like it more than nvm
2016-03-22 06:52:48	@xero	but i still use n in our docker scripts
2016-03-22 06:56:21	greduan	What are its advantages over nvm?
2016-03-22 06:56:36	@xero	idk, they do the exact same thing
2016-03-22 06:56:44	@xero	but you can install this w/ npm
2016-03-22 06:57:19	greduan	so can you nvm iirc
2016-03-22 06:57:43	@xero	nah
2016-03-22 06:57:48	@xero	you have to use a shell script

2016-03-22 07:01:39	greduan	it does have a default one but you can set it per shell
2016-03-22 07:01:44	greduan	I know cause I've had trouble with that. lol
2016-03-22 07:02:43	@xero	node's versioning is worse than python's
2016-03-22 07:10:50	tudurom	ruby is worse
2016-03-22 07:12:36	@xero	if your lang needs a version manager you're doing it wrong
2016-03-22 07:19:10	L8D	node has a version manager?
2016-03-22 07:19:16	L8D	oh nvm
2016-03-22 07:19:26	L8D	I guess that's a problem but really I don't think many people use it
2016-03-22 07:19:31	@xero	nvm, nave, n... there are lots of them
2016-03-22 07:20:11	L8D	most people can install v4 or v5 and be just fine... Although upgrading minor releases is a pain because of how different OS's install node
2016-03-22 07:20:22	L8D	which is why there are version managers. Not much you can do :/
2016-03-22 07:20:34	L8D	but it's not a fault of a language, and not a problem many people have to deal with
2016-03-22 07:20:50	L8D	Node.js has very stable releases, unlike Ruby
2016-03-22 07:21:51	tudurom	ruby has many implementations

2016-03-22 07:31:16	L8D	Maybe Ruby is just more capitalistic

2016-03-22 08:45:26	@fro	suppose that depends really
2016-03-22 08:45:35	@fro	ksh on openbsd is being actively developed
2016-03-22 08:45:36	rocx`	mksh probably works better in interactive scenarios.
2016-03-22 08:45:47	@fro	i don't think whatever version is on most linux distros is
2016-03-22 08:45:51	ygstr	fro: cause i'm going to openbsd soon
2016-03-22 08:46:09	@fro	also mksh isn't in ports or packages on openbsd
2016-03-22 08:46:18	ygstr	so just use ksh
2016-03-22 08:46:23	@fro	up to you
2016-03-22 08:46:26	@fro	i use ksh
2016-03-22 08:46:28	@fro	works fine

2016-03-22 08:47:08	@xero	pdksh or ksh93
2016-03-22 08:47:09	rocx`	probably a thunkpad.

2016-03-22 08:54:43	@xero	^^
2016-03-22 08:54:48	@fro	so install cinammon on ubuntu

2016-03-22 08:54:56	%kirby	But Cinammon is good
2016-03-22 08:55:02	@xero	i like debian more than ubuntu

2016-03-22 08:56:27	@fro	but i mean
2016-03-22 08:56:37	@fro	if you're just gonna install it for the kid
2016-03-22 08:56:40	@fro	use debian

2016-03-22 08:56:50	@fro	i don't get it
2016-03-22 08:57:10	+fyr	i'll just go with mint

2016-03-22 08:59:09	@fro	why would there be inconsistencies?
2016-03-22 08:59:16	+fyr	because it's debian
2016-03-22 08:59:28	%kirby	Install both and come back and tell me yourself
2016-03-22 08:59:32	@fro	yeah no

2016-03-22 09:00:49	+fyr	debian won't do that as well as mint
2016-03-22 09:00:56	@fro	lots of distros work out of the box

2016-03-22 09:01:12	@fro	etc etc etc
2016-03-22 09:01:18	@fro	there's no more reason to use mint over those
2016-03-22 09:01:25	%kirby	Then the kid will go around saying "I use Fedora" and he'll be the world's youngest neckbeard
2016-03-22 09:01:52	@xero	buy him a red hat while you're at it

2016-03-22 09:53:58	irc-5225225	greduan: Should be Ctrl+Alt+F<something>
2016-03-22 09:54:14	irc-5225225	Though that does seem to be broken on my machine if X11 is running...
2016-03-22 09:54:33	greduan	irc-5225225: yeah problem is on a Macbook's keyboard the F keys are special keys by default (i.e. media keys and such)
2016-03-22 09:54:35	arc	rocx: it's okay so far
2016-03-22 09:54:36	arc	tryna rice
2016-03-22 09:55:04	arc	namely i need to get out of the habit of using it in the term
2016-03-22 09:55:11	arc	the theme i'm using grabs xres colors
2016-03-22 09:55:11	irc-5225225	Yeah, so it would be ctrl+alt+fn+F<something>,assuming you can even press that many keys.
2016-03-22 09:55:29	greduan	irc-5225225: yup it works
2016-03-22 09:55:35	greduan	forgot I had to press fn to reverse it. lol
2016-03-22 09:59:17	%kirby	Guys I want to make a crappy picture viewer in C, do I use Xlib or XCB?
2016-03-22 10:00:16	greduan	XCB
2016-03-22 10:00:19	greduan	j/k I dunno
2016-03-22 10:00:26	greduan	I hear XCB is quicker
2016-03-22 10:00:45	%kirby	Just reading the "why" sections of guides for both it sounds like XCB is better
2016-03-22 10:01:01	%kirby	The picture I think I'm seeing is "Xlib is pretty old and bloated".
2016-03-22 10:01:10	%kirby	Anyone here please correct me if I'm wrong.
2016-03-22 10:05:11	greduan	that's what I understand as well
2016-03-22 10:05:18	greduan	But xlib is better documented afaik
2016-03-22 10:16:14	%kirby	Oh
2016-03-22 10:16:43	%kirby	The xcb tutorial on their site just stops after making a connection with a big "TODO".

2016-03-22 12:23:30	lazr_	wtf baskerville
2016-03-22 12:23:37	lazr_	i liked that feature
2016-03-22 12:23:42	+fyr	but I've added a pr to add xmmv back to opt
2016-03-22 12:23:48	+fyr	hopefully dcat will merge it
2016-03-22 12:24:01	lazr_	ok well where can I find that
2016-03-22 12:24:13	+fyr	https://github.com/wildefyr/opt
2016-03-22 12:26:11	lazr_	thanks fyr
2016-03-22 12:28:06	halfwit	Fuck backwards compatibility, if the change makes the software much bbetter.
2016-03-22 12:30:58	lazr_	this is directly not better however
2016-03-22 12:31:10	lazr_	it was a feature that I was using that was removed...
2016-03-22 12:31:30	lazr_	normally I would agree but there are other considerations here
2016-03-22 12:31:44	lazr_	like make the thing without it a new version or something
2016-03-22 12:31:47	lazr_	SOMETHING
2016-03-22 12:35:20	lazr_	xmmv is good though
2016-03-22 12:35:24	lazr_	thanks fyr again
2016-03-22 12:35:40	+fyr	eh np

2016-03-22 14:18:59	@rocx	firefox knows this and won't allow me to activate the flash player.
2016-03-22 14:19:12	@fro	why would you even have that installed
2016-03-22 14:19:24	+fyr	if you need flash use the chrome binary
2016-03-22 14:19:24	@rocx	pearson, for a retarded reason, requires me to use the flash player in order to access the online book, the only one i have.

2016-03-22 14:20:44	@rocx	TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, THERE IS A QUIZ I HAVE TO DO WHICH REQUIRES LOOKING INTO THE BOOK.
2016-03-22 14:20:55	@rocx	thus, mozilla dictates whether or not i pass this quiz.

2016-03-22 14:21:21	@rocx	fyr: it was cheaper doing that than a physical book by a good bit.

2016-03-22 14:21:37	@fro	i seem to recall needing java installed for school
2016-03-22 14:21:42	@fro	that was horrible
2016-03-22 14:22:08	@rocx	fro: yeah. java course.
2016-03-22 14:22:28	@fro	nah i mean just the java plugin
2016-03-22 14:22:43	@fro	this wasn't a java class
2016-03-22 14:22:48	@rocx	oh.

2016-03-22 14:23:52	@fro	human geography
2016-03-22 14:24:34	@fro	i don't remember what it was
2016-03-22 14:24:46	@fro	maybe just my school email
2016-03-22 14:25:01	@fro	but something required java and it was a pain on lunix
2016-03-22 14:26:26	+fyr	but java is cross platform!
2016-03-22 14:26:38	@fro	yeah but it's shitty
2016-03-22 14:27:01	+fyr	doesn't stop companies using it though

2016-03-22 14:27:39	%adam	we had to use java for mymathlab last semester
2016-03-22 14:28:07	@rocx	i feel sorry for anyone having to use pearson's my____lab.
2016-03-22 14:28:33	%adam	yea there were times where my answer would be the exact correct answer

2016-03-22 16:33:17	+fyr	I could do with buying a new one

2016-03-22 16:33:40	@venam	and prepare a bunch of topics
2016-03-22 16:34:11	+fyr	hmm I'll try to think of some..
2016-03-22 16:42:40	+fyr	we should certainly have one on editors

2016-03-22 16:45:06	%vypr	haha

2016-03-24 00:53:07	fsociety	im on bspwm, but i think im ready to play with wmutils again for shits and giggles
2016-03-24 00:53:23	fsociety	just need to create a tiling script that doesn't have a master area
2016-03-24 00:54:29	@xero	fsociety: i pretty much have my set "work layout" that i swawn via a script
2016-03-24 00:54:47	@xero	on my personal machine it's more manual
2016-03-24 00:55:07	fsociety	xero: yeah that was the next option, but i want to see if i can immitate the bspwm binary thing using shell scripts
2016-03-24 00:55:35	fsociety	xero: another option was to write all the core elements in python or something like that as an academic exercise also
2016-03-24 00:55:59	@xero	nothing is stopping you from scripting wmutils in any lang
2016-03-24 00:56:20	fsociety	xero: oh yeah i know, its a good way to test languages i think

2016-03-24 01:09:06	greduan	xero: do you know how it behaves on multiple monitors?
2016-03-24 01:09:10	greduan	like do I get 20 workspaces?
2016-03-24 01:09:20	greduan	or 10 and whicehver monitor wins the workspaces is the one who gets to use it?
2016-03-24 01:09:24	@xero	you get as many workspaces as you define in your config
2016-03-24 01:09:38	@xero	each monitor can display a simple workspace
2016-03-24 01:09:49	@xero	and a workspace can be on any single monitor
2016-03-24 01:09:54	Shinryuu	I wonder what to modify today
2016-03-24 01:10:12	@xero	you can view any workspace on any monitor
2016-03-24 01:10:24	greduan	OK
2016-03-24 01:10:45	greduan	can I like sync the monitors to always be on the same workspaces? not actually the same workspace, just make the workspaces switch in pairs
2016-03-24 01:10:48	greduan	probs in Xmonad
2016-03-24 01:10:57	greduan	cause that's a flow I picked up in OS X and I liked it
2016-03-24 01:11:11	@xero	greduan: if you script it to. it doesnt do that ootb
2016-03-24 01:12:31	greduan	right
2016-03-24 01:12:33	greduan	k
2016-03-24 01:12:45	greduan	time to setup Xmonad and feel happy about myself. lol
2016-03-24 01:12:53	greduan	need to relearn Haskell, I knew the basics at some point

2016-03-24 09:53:22	greduan	From their project file to their CI
2016-03-24 09:53:25	greduan	everything is a mess
2016-03-24 09:54:13	greduan	and the businessman didn't even try the tests himself, he let the CI fail and told us there was something wrong in a specific part. spent hours trying to fix that. I go and check the CI, the step he was telling us to fix never actually failed, it was a later step which there is no way to fix atm.

2016-03-24 10:42:06	+fyr	no the window titles
2016-03-24 10:43:59	angel	so "chrome" is the window title of the last focused window of the group?
2016-03-24 10:44:56	+fyr	no it concatenates all window titles into a string
2016-03-24 10:45:00	+fyr	in a group*

2016-03-24 10:52:28	greduan	how hard do you think it would be to implement basic tiling?
2016-03-24 10:53:19	angel	adding "tile.sh" from contrib/ to focus watcher at window creation/destroy?
2016-03-24 10:53:46	+fyr	greduan, I already did once upon a time
2016-03-24 10:53:57	greduan	github.com/wildefyr/fyre
2016-03-24 10:54:20	greduan	cause I've a small screen so tiling is the way to go to get as much space as possible
2016-03-24 10:54:26	+fyr	mhm
2016-03-24 10:54:33	+fyr	it's on my todo list
2016-03-24 10:54:40	fsociety	fyr: do you not have your old tiling script anymore?
2016-03-24 10:54:52	+fyr	I do but it won't work because it's too old
2016-03-24 10:55:19	greduan	tiling and workspaces, though groups do that
2016-03-24 10:55:24	greduan	thing is that groups and tiling don't get along
2016-03-24 10:55:30	greduan	to do tiling you gotta do workspaces not groups
2016-03-24 10:55:45	+fyr	yeah it works better with workspaces for sure
2016-03-24 10:55:57	angel	cwm has tiling and groups
2016-03-24 10:56:05	angel	but it tiles per group
2016-03-24 10:56:11	greduan	ah
2016-03-24 10:56:24	greduan	so it uses workspaces basically lol
2016-03-24 10:56:33	greduan	can't have more than one group on screen at once
2016-03-24 10:56:46	greduan	unless you do a new thing where you say "this group can only appear on this half of the screen" kinda thing
2016-03-24 10:57:33	+fyr	yeah that's dumb

2016-03-24 11:57:31	fsociety	fyr: and very windows centric

2016-03-24 11:58:07	+fyr	I couldn't believe it when I watched it
2016-03-24 11:58:20	half	lol
2016-03-24 11:58:30	half	They started paying money.
2016-03-24 11:58:41	+fyr	they ssh'd into the box in the end to fix rofl

2016-03-24 12:07:59	half	Huh. Can't find the issue.
2016-03-24 12:08:17	half	fyr: I was all for it, until I got my hands really dirty. Things started to become more and more clear, and yeah. 
2016-03-24 12:08:25	half	fyr: It's not a step in the right direction.
2016-03-24 12:09:06	fsociety	i wait for all of our obscure window managers to support wayland. haha
2016-03-24 12:09:07	+fyr	agreed
2016-03-24 12:09:33	half	Erm
2016-03-24 12:09:35	half	They won't
2016-03-24 12:10:02	half	It's a big fucking job to write a compositor for wayland \o/
2016-03-24 12:10:17	fsociety	i'd imagine someone would at least fork someone, i know there is a big code rewrite.. but i'd imagine people would use initial design and rewrite the core
2016-03-24 12:10:19	half	Best bet is to use a thin client that acts as a plugin manager, and write whatever plugins you want based upon that.
2016-03-24 12:10:25	half	(Orbment is this, by the way)
2016-03-24 12:10:37	fsociety	yeah i remember looking at it back on github a while back
2016-03-24 12:10:39	+fyr	yeah, I think people are gonna have to agree on some kind of framework
2016-03-24 12:10:40	half	They have default plugins that give you a dwm-feeling 
2016-03-24 12:10:48	+fyr	but this is linux so they won't
2016-03-24 12:11:16	half	Wayland is nice for the big DE guys
2016-03-24 12:11:32	fsociety	but not for minimalist window managers

2016-03-24 12:11:58	+fyr	:/
2016-03-24 12:12:06	half	Any one-off thing such as that needs to be built in to the compositor proper.
2016-03-24 12:12:17	+fyr	well at least we know that wmutils will run on anything that supports a C compiler
2016-03-24 12:12:18	half	It's shit, but hopefully someone can make a sane plugin deal.

2016-03-24 12:16:30	+fyr	i'm lazy
2016-03-24 12:16:36	half	To lay out a basic window using those, it's like 50 LOC
2016-03-24 12:16:37	+fyr	that's why I wrote fyre in shell script
2016-03-24 12:16:40	half	\ol
2016-03-24 12:18:01	half	fyr: No judging. C is for tools that you script :p
2016-03-24 12:19:32	fsociety	if we are going to do it properly lets just write it in ASM. hahaha
2016-03-24 12:19:42	@rocx	> assembly
2016-03-24 12:19:44	@rocx	> properly
2016-03-24 12:20:21	@rocx	you want to disregard lord ritchie's invention to favor what he was trying to abstract?
2016-03-24 12:22:30	half	rocx: The past, who cares about the past?
2016-03-24 12:22:40	@rocx	assembly is fax piss.
2016-03-24 12:22:53	half	Writing full things in assembly will likely not result in faster programs.

2016-03-24 12:43:47	+fyr	it does

2016-03-24 12:55:45	half	Just bad.
2016-03-24 12:55:59	half	All bad. Boxer briefs are the only joy I've ever felt down there.

2016-03-25 02:36:56	%adam	they... well
2016-03-25 02:37:01	%adam	they really kinda took unix
2016-03-25 02:37:07	%adam	and warped it for their own hardware, own needs

2016-03-25 02:38:06	%adam	they were all like
2016-03-25 02:38:12	%adam	"Guys"
2016-03-25 02:38:16	%adam	"Shits getting kinda fucked rn"

2016-03-25 02:38:36	%adam	"UNIX wasnt made for this!"
2016-03-25 02:38:52	%adam	and so some other guys were like
2016-03-25 02:38:57	%adam	"Yeah yeah i feel ya i feel ya"
2016-03-25 02:39:00	%adam	"we should do this"
2016-03-25 02:39:01	%adam	"we should do this"
2016-03-25 02:39:05	%adam	"lets take UNIX"
2016-03-25 02:39:12	%adam	"and just do the best thing imaginable"
2016-03-25 02:39:19	%adam	"reinvent it."
2016-03-25 02:39:22	%adam	"make it better"
2016-03-25 02:39:27	%adam	Thus the idea of Plan 9
2016-03-25 02:39:28	%adam	was born
2016-03-25 02:39:44	%adam	Robert Pikerton was kinda already flowin some ideas in his mind
2016-03-25 02:39:55	%adam	you may know him from the greatest terminal to grace this earth, Blit
2016-03-25 02:40:12	%adam	now Rob had a thing for quite a few things
2016-03-25 02:40:14	%adam	thingy things
2016-03-25 02:40:21	%adam	graphical terminals, distributed applications

2016-03-25 02:40:23	%adam	CONCURRENCY
2016-03-25 02:40:28	%adam	so Rob was like

2016-03-25 02:42:17	%adam	"Yeah, I think we can pull some cool shit off for this new unix thing"
2016-03-25 02:42:18	%adam	and so ken goes
2016-03-25 02:42:20	%adam	ken goes
2016-03-25 02:42:22	%adam	and he said this
2016-03-25 02:42:24	%adam	this is true
2016-03-25 02:42:31	%adam	"damn straight, mothafucka."
2016-03-25 02:42:39	%adam	that is true
2016-03-25 02:42:40	%adam	i was there
2016-03-25 02:42:47	%adam	so all the dudes start just
2016-03-25 02:42:50	%adam	TEARING APART UNIX
2016-03-25 02:42:52	%adam	they were like
2016-03-25 02:42:55	%adam	"Yeah we can still use this"
2016-03-25 02:42:59	%adam	"Nah we cant use this"
2016-03-25 02:43:07	%adam	and then ken and rob kinda did some cooler shit

2016-03-25 02:43:10	%adam	ken and rob were kinda like
2016-03-25 02:43:13	%adam	doin som cool shit
2016-03-25 02:43:22	%adam	see rob also had this text editor
2016-03-25 02:43:23	%adam	called
2016-03-25 02:43:25	%adam	'sam'
2016-03-25 02:43:35	%adam	and sam really encompassed this plan 9 philosophy
2016-03-25 02:43:35	%adam	right
2016-03-25 02:43:41	%adam	sam is a graphical editor
2016-03-25 02:43:48	%adam	which uses similar grammar to ed
2016-03-25 02:43:54	%adam	really its more or less the successor to ed
2016-03-25 02:44:02	%adam	so rob had 8 1/2 and sam
2016-03-25 02:44:04	%adam	and he was like
2016-03-25 02:44:10	%adam	"yo these apps are mad trippin"
2016-03-25 02:44:16	%adam	"NETWORK TRANSPARENCY AND CONCURRENCY?"
2016-03-25 02:44:25	%adam	"damn i smoke a lotta weed"
2016-03-25 02:44:35	%adam	so the dudes were outlining what the system would do
2016-03-25 02:44:40	%adam	because they lived in a new era
2016-03-25 02:44:42	%adam	the future!

2016-03-25 02:45:04	%adam	"Yeah but these bitmap displays doe"
2016-03-25 02:45:17	%adam	so they make plan 9 completely network transparent

2016-03-25 03:35:09	mc68030	knife that open, another bubblemailer
2016-03-25 03:35:37	mc68030	knife that open, and there's osme of that thin pink foam stuff that you use to wrap static-sensitive devices in, and a CD-ROM drive under that
2016-03-25 03:36:00	mc68030	For a moment I felt like the eBay seller was Xzibit. 
2016-03-25 03:36:20	half	Yo dawg
2016-03-25 03:36:30	mc68030	yup.
2016-03-25 03:36:32	half	Pimp my xpresspost
2016-03-25 03:37:04	half	I did that for Christmas, with an Xbox 360
2016-03-25 03:37:25	half	Like 6 boxes of taped to shit cruelty,
2016-03-25 03:37:36	half	With plastic wrap in-between some layers
2016-03-25 03:37:58	mc68030	why would you confuse someone's emotions like that? :)
2016-03-25 03:38:13	half	The bitch had it coming.
2016-03-25 03:38:22	half	Girlfriends.
2016-03-25 03:38:27	mc68030	ah, ok.

2016-03-25 03:43:43	mc68030	rocx: have you had the opportunity to look at Riece? 
2016-03-25 03:43:52	@rocx	another irc client?
2016-03-25 03:44:00	mc68030	in elisp, yeah
2016-03-25 03:44:15	mc68030	I find it a little more complex than ERC in terms of user xperience, but it's pretty nifty
2016-03-25 03:44:22	@rocx	checking it out RIGHT NOW.
2016-03-25 03:44:34	@rocx	circe sucks, i can tell you that.
2016-03-25 03:44:48	half	Lol.
2016-03-25 03:44:53	half	Emacs running an IRC client.
2016-03-25 03:45:03	@rocx	it can be done.
2016-03-25 03:45:05	half	Because fuck sanity!
2016-03-25 03:45:11	@rocx	half: it's handy sometimes.
2016-03-25 03:45:33	half	rocx: For tunnelling especially
2016-03-25 03:45:39	half	I'd use the fuck out of it for that
2016-03-25 03:45:39	@rocx	like now, i just saved adam's conversation simply by C-x C-w and edited an ERC buffer like text.
2016-03-25 03:47:03	half	You could do that with a lot of them, so long as you don't have aggressive log rotation
2016-03-25 03:47:09	half	But I get what you mean.
2016-03-25 03:47:49	@rocx	heck, the main reason i switched to emacs was to streamline my workflow a bit better than a bazillion terminals.
2016-03-25 03:48:13	half	I did the same thing with wmutils, guess it's just a matter of which thing you want doing that
2016-03-25 03:49:04	half	And fuck chording \o/
2016-03-25 03:50:07	@rocx	there's a reason why a lot of people joke about many keyboards for emacs users.
2016-03-25 03:50:13	@rocx	because chording sucks unless it's short and memorable.
2016-03-25 03:50:22	half	Yep. Evil mode was ok
2016-03-25 03:50:35	@rocx	meant C-x C-f, C-x C-s, a couple of other ones.
2016-03-25 03:50:40	half	I just felt the whole overbearing feeling of "why am I using this, when I could do it simply without emacs?"
2016-03-25 03:50:42	@rocx	basically ones where you can keep holding control.
2016-03-25 03:51:15	@rocx	THANKFULLY RMS is no longer maintaining it so it should start getting less sucky from now.
2016-03-25 03:51:30	sbrg	emacs + evil-mode > vim
2016-03-25 03:51:33	sbrg	no need to use the insane defaults
2016-03-25 03:51:34	@rocx	next release, some features are going to be ELPA packages instead of out-of-the-box.
2016-03-25 03:51:43	@rocx	like org-mode.
2016-03-25 03:52:45	half	Shhh shhh shh sbrg.
2016-03-25 03:52:48	half	Let's not be sily now.
2016-03-25 03:53:18	@rocx	heck, i'm skeptical about C-{n,b,f,p} being a normal thing but rather as an incentive to get a user to tinker with the ecosystem and rebind those keys.
2016-03-25 03:53:20	half	masterful shell scripting + native tools + $EDITOR > an all in one editor solution doing the aforementioned
2016-03-25 03:53:34	sbrg	you can have both

2016-03-25 03:53:42	@rocx	not going to lie, i love that way, half. but terminals are just a thing of the past.
2016-03-25 03:53:47	sbrg	emacs doesn't automatically prevent you from doing whatever you did before

2016-03-25 03:54:52	%adam	^
2016-03-25 03:54:53	half	Duh.
2016-03-25 03:55:06	@rocx	you could still have a shell mode type thing but if a program could, BAM! it became a graphical program!
2016-03-25 03:55:23	%adam	each term also had its own namespace
2016-03-25 03:55:25	@rocx	if it became more popular instead of linux, someone would have no doubt written vi for it.
2016-03-25 03:55:26	%adam	which was really cool
2016-03-25 03:55:42	half	Don't extoll the grandness of Plan9 to me, sonny-Jim.
2016-03-25 03:56:01	%adam	just sayin yo
2016-03-25 03:56:12	half	rocx: Yeah. I assume that there would be keyboard controls all over like we have here, it was pretty fucking simple to write stuff for.
2016-03-25 03:56:29	@rocx	heck, you could also format text for those terminals with shell commands too.
2016-03-25 03:56:41	half	A billion less syscalls!
2016-03-25 03:56:59	half	I did what I could with Linux tools to get there, but it's like
2016-03-25 03:57:04	half	It's still a million miles away.
2016-03-25 03:57:42	half	Fucking Linux. Unix. Windows. Mac. Fuck everything but TempleOS.

2016-03-25 03:58:53	half	You know though

2016-03-25 04:04:22	half	Eh.
2016-03-25 04:04:27	half	I have that sorta I guess.
2016-03-25 04:04:32	@rocx	of course, spacemacs made it cool now. the editor wars are over. despite that spacemacs sucks.
2016-03-25 04:04:35	half	st external pipe patch

2016-03-25 04:07:48	half	echo has tenure.
2016-03-25 04:08:12	@xero	echo has too many conflicting implementations that are not posix
2016-03-25 04:08:13	fuyuki	rocx: good idea
2016-03-25 04:08:29	@rocx	exactly. echo hopefully will be deprecated from POSIX soon.
2016-03-25 04:08:52	@xero	if your echo has flags, it's doing it wrong

2016-03-25 16:25:58	greduan	that was actually clever and while sort of a deus ex machina, it completely makes sense within the context and this world

2016-03-25 18:18:25	beetle	i guess i could use nginx basic authentication
2016-03-25 18:18:26	@z3bra	yeah
2016-03-25 18:18:32	@z3bra	then don't share it?

2016-03-25 18:20:12	@z3bra	see
2016-03-25 18:21:29	@z3bra	then stagit is not an option
2016-03-25 18:21:50	@z3bra	as it generates static pages
2016-03-25 18:23:08	@z3bra	if you want to share it with the world, while keeping it for yourself, you need some sort of dynamic content, and authentication
2016-03-25 18:23:23	@z3bra	which stagit don't, and won't provide
2016-03-25 18:23:31	@z3bra	(this is by design)
2016-03-25 18:24:08	beetle	hmm i don't trust the other non-static git servers
2016-03-25 18:24:32	beetle	i could create two directories one public one private
2016-03-25 18:24:42	beetle	and configure nginx to use basic authentication
2016-03-25 18:24:59	@z3bra	why don't you trust them?
2016-03-25 18:25:56	beetle	its is more i don't trust myself to maintain a ruby on rails site
2016-03-25 18:26:12	@z3bra	who's talking about ruby on rails?
2016-03-25 18:26:24	beetle	gitlab

2016-03-25 20:32:33	mc68030	win98 -> winMe -> mandrake (kde 3) -> winXP -> CentOS (Gnome2) -> "it got complicated" 
2016-03-25 20:34:00	mc68030	"complicated" ended up being a whole mix of things at once, but sorta settled on me standardising on OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Gentoo :P

2016-03-25 20:49:12	Shinryuu	Gnome 2.0 -> *box (flux/open), dwm (fiddled with patches), dwm forks, monsterwm (for years), herbstluftwm (for years) and now I've been fiddling with 2bwm but no idea if this is going to be the main one, I might just fallback to herbstluftwm

2016-03-26 06:21:40	+seth	do you guys use multiple tmux sessions?
2016-03-26 06:21:46	+seth	I just started to do that, I like it a lot
2016-03-26 06:22:25	angel	yeah
2016-03-26 06:22:28	angel	it's useful
2016-03-26 06:22:31	Lola	how do you use them?
2016-03-26 06:22:33	tudurom	what do you mean by multiple tmux sessions?
2016-03-26 06:22:36	tudurom	i have one for every window
2016-03-26 06:22:45	+seth	hehe, that seems excessive
2016-03-26 06:22:50	+seth	I have one session for each monitor right now
2016-03-26 06:22:51	angel	you can have one window, and sessions like main, etc, fun, media
2016-03-26 06:22:55	greduan	seth: yeah
2016-03-26 06:23:02	greduan	one per project essentially
2016-03-26 06:23:16	Lola	I generally just use windows on the same session for all those things
2016-03-26 06:23:20	angel	and in that window you just press prefix + s and select sessions
2016-03-26 06:23:46	+seth	yeah, I use a window per project and a session per monitor
2016-03-26 06:24:07	tudurom	prefix + s this is black magic!
2016-03-26 06:24:20	+seth	I do prefix + ( for prev session and prefix + ) for next
2016-03-26 06:24:23	+seth	I believe that's default
2016-03-26 06:25:20	tudurom	yup
2016-03-26 06:25:21	angel	yeah, it's the default
2016-03-26 06:25:45	@xero	seth: i often do two sessions
2016-03-26 06:26:00	@xero	one for work, and one for system monitoring
2016-03-26 06:26:12	@xero	but they really could just be one
2016-03-26 06:26:45	Lola	I've changed my tmux keybindings to the point where they don't resemble the defaults whatsoever
2016-03-26 06:28:10	@xero	seth got me hooked on ` as the leader
2016-03-26 06:28:35	@xero	a lot nicer than a keychord imo
2016-03-26 06:29:08	tudurom	do you have long fingers?
2016-03-26 06:29:10	Lola	I use ^k, using my right hand as the prefix, and all the suffixes are centred around wsad
2016-03-26 06:29:26	angel	where does tmux read the default config from?
2016-03-26 06:29:29	Lola	which is pretty damn comfortable
2016-03-26 06:29:47	@xero	~/.tmux.conf
2016-03-26 06:29:52	angel	i once screwed up the bindings and had to set the defaults by hand
2016-03-26 06:30:16	angel	xero: i mean the defaults, system wide
2016-03-26 06:30:31	angel	man page says /etc/tmux.conf but doesn't exist
2016-03-26 06:31:22	Lola	I don't think there is a default file
2016-03-26 06:31:24	@xero	i dont think many distro ship a systemwide tmux conf
2016-03-26 06:31:27	Lola	you can just mae some and it'l read em
2016-03-26 06:31:46	angel	it's strange

2016-03-26 06:38:40	@xero	i'm away
2016-03-26 06:38:49	%adam	hey does anyone know go fairly well

2016-03-26 06:39:18	%adam	seth: do byte arrays hold newline characters?
2016-03-26 06:39:29	Lola	mort_ was using it. Not sure if he knows it well or was just experimenting though.
2016-03-26 06:39:40	+seth	0a is newline
2016-03-26 06:39:42	+seth	in golang?
2016-03-26 06:39:51	Lola	unless they replaced ascii
2016-03-26 06:39:53	Lola	probably
2016-03-26 06:39:55	fuyuki	tudurom: what client are you using
2016-03-26 06:39:56	%adam	yea
2016-03-26 06:39:57	+seth	byte array should hold any bytes you put into it
2016-03-26 06:40:06	%adam	okay so 
2016-03-26 06:40:17	mort_	I was using go ye
2016-03-26 06:40:25	%adam	if i read a file from ioutil and then store it into a []byte
2016-03-26 06:40:32	%adam	newlines are elements with 9a
2016-03-26 06:40:32	+seth	should be 1:1
2016-03-26 06:40:35	mort_	why shouldn't a byte array be able to hold newline chars?
2016-03-26 06:40:36	%adam	0a*
2016-03-26 06:40:40	+seth	yes, 0a is \n
2016-03-26 06:40:40	%adam	im just wondering
2016-03-26 06:40:42	mort_	after all, they're in ascii/unicode
2016-03-26 06:40:46	+seth	you can confirm with xxd
2016-03-26 06:40:48	+seth	$ xxd file
2016-03-26 06:41:08	@xero	isnt there a bufio.Scanner
2016-03-26 06:41:20	+seth	ioutil is a highlevel lib
2016-03-26 06:41:23	+seth	makes reading files ez
2016-03-26 06:41:27	@xero	or bufio.ReadLine()
2016-03-26 06:41:42	+seth	yeah, depends on his use-case. If you're reading configs and the like, ioutil will suffice
2016-03-26 06:41:56	mort_	I kind of love the io.Writer/io.Reader interface
2016-03-26 06:42:04	%adam	im reading yaml, technically
2016-03-26 06:42:05	+seth	they are really nice
2016-03-26 06:42:10	%adam	but its not really yaml
2016-03-26 06:42:14	%adam	it just looks like yaml
2016-03-26 06:42:56	%adam	i just want to have a variable that stores an entire line read from a byte array and was curious as to whether or notmy idea was correct
2016-03-26 06:42:59	greduan	nooo I want more political stuff from this anime :(
2016-03-26 06:43:08	+seth	you can just cast it to a string and split on newlines
2016-03-26 06:43:20	+seth	or split at the byte array level on 0a's
2016-03-26 06:43:27	%adam	oh yea thats actually easier
2016-03-26 06:43:34	%adam	i was gonna do the latter
2016-03-26 06:43:39	%adam	but the former works too
2016-03-26 06:43:50	+seth	whichever, it's rather fast at that sort of thing
2016-03-26 06:44:17	%adam	but why are newlines 0a instead of \n?
2016-03-26 06:44:46	mort_	0a is probably the hex code for the ascii line feed character
2016-03-26 06:44:57	%adam	oh
2016-03-26 06:44:59	%adam	duh
2016-03-26 06:45:10	@xero	http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/000A/index.htm
2016-03-26 06:45:11	%adam	SO REALLY
2016-03-26 06:45:17	%adam	i could just have used "\n" this whole time
2016-03-26 06:45:25	mort_	probably lol
2016-03-26 06:45:32	%adam	good job adam
2016-03-26 06:45:34	%adam	you fucking idiot
2016-03-26 06:45:42	@xero	you learned something in the process
2016-03-26 06:45:50	@xero	nothing lost, everything gained
2016-03-26 06:46:00	%adam	yea i know i know
2016-03-26 06:46:00	@xero	except some time
2016-03-26 06:46:26	mort_	but then again, time is the only truly finite resource in life
2016-03-26 06:46:43	%adam	i...
2016-03-26 06:46:45	%adam	is it though?
2016-03-26 06:47:11	%adam	nah i dont wanna talk about that
2016-03-26 06:47:13	%adam	i get what you mean mort
2016-03-26 06:47:17	mort_	probably not, but it sounds all fancy and philosophical
2016-03-26 06:47:45	+seth	https://play.golang.org/p/VD6YXIRjHM
2016-03-26 06:48:03	+seth	yes, 0a is newline in hex lol
2016-03-26 06:48:21	+seth	printf '\n\r' | xxd
2016-03-26 06:48:26	%adam	thnx for the example seth
2016-03-26 06:48:33	+seth	sure adam :)
2016-03-26 06:48:51	mort_	wait, does golang's standard format thing specify tabs?
2016-03-26 06:49:00	+seth	as in \t ?
2016-03-26 06:49:03	%adam	that would just be \t right
2016-03-26 06:49:12	mort_	I know a lot of code style is codified in go, but I always expected it to use spaces, as most things seem to love those for some reason
2016-03-26 06:49:15	mort_	and yes, tabs as in \t
2016-03-26 06:49:27	+seth	gofmt will convert spaces to tabs
2016-03-26 06:49:32	mort_	very neat
2016-03-26 06:49:39	+seth	you don't have to do that, but I have it set up to do so
2016-03-26 06:49:54	+seth	have vim* set up to do so on save *
2016-03-26 06:50:35	%adam	vim-go does that automatically
2016-03-26 06:50:44	+seth	yeah fatih's vim-go plugin
2016-03-26 06:50:46	+seth	good stuff

2016-03-26 07:03:35	%adam	that function copies all lines leading up to a line that consists of "---" and stores it in an array called metaData
2016-03-26 07:03:39	%adam	i think

2016-03-26 07:11:30	+seth	so it breaks out of the loop if there's a '---' in the file?
2016-03-26 07:11:44	%adam	yea
2016-03-26 07:11:56	%adam	the first time it comes across that type of line
2016-03-26 07:12:02	%adam	it mimicks jekyll in that regard
2016-03-26 07:12:08	+seth	don't assign metaData to nil, I'm not sure what that will do. just declare it like "  var metaData []string   "
2016-03-26 07:12:18	%adam	ah ok
2016-03-26 07:12:29	+seth	nil is for refs and pointers, usually uninitialized types have a value
2016-03-26 07:12:41	+seth	like " var foo Bool " will be False by default
2016-03-26 07:12:51	+seth	and uninitialized string will be ""
2016-03-26 07:15:53	greduan	holy fuck that summon is OP
2016-03-26 07:16:56	+seth	Ah, adam, the reason you can do  "  var Foo []string = nil  " 
2016-03-26 07:17:09	+seth	is because [] is a slice, which *references* the array type
2016-03-26 07:17:18	+seth	http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals
2016-03-26 07:17:19	%adam	so its a pointer?
2016-03-26 07:17:28	+seth	yeah, to the array 
2016-03-26 07:18:13	+seth	A slice is a descriptor of an array segment. It consists of a pointer to the array, the length of the segment, and its capacity (the maximum length of the segment).
2016-03-26 07:19:20	+seth	https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/11 
2016-03-26 07:19:22	+seth	The zero value of a slice is nil.
2016-03-26 07:19:24	+seth	A nil slice has a length and capacity of 0.
2016-03-26 07:19:26	+seth	okay, now I understand
2016-03-26 07:19:35	+seth	so I guess explicitly setting to nil is fine, just overly verbose
2016-03-26 07:20:12	%adam	redundant
2016-03-26 07:25:56	%adam	seth: does the ':=' operator change datatypes even if the variable that is being given an assignment has been used before?
2016-03-26 07:26:16	%adam	so if i did "x := 3"
2016-03-26 07:26:28	%adam	is x := "hi" fine?

2016-03-26 08:52:07	arc	thnx
2016-03-26 08:52:10	fuyuki	you can also use http://www.colorhexa.com/ to play with it
2016-03-26 08:52:25	greduan	Mayouu Maou Yuusha, BTW, is literally all about economics, politics, war, etc. It goes into all that shit in deep depth. Controlling economies, resources, war tactics, etc. etc. etc.
2016-03-26 08:52:32	greduan	really fucking interesting
2016-03-26 08:52:39	greduan	chapter is translated once every few months
2016-03-26 08:52:41	tudurom	arc: hue is the color. Values are from 0 to 360 or something
2016-03-26 08:52:46	greduan	with good reason, so many fucking words in each page. lol
2016-03-26 08:52:50	arc	ok
2016-03-26 08:53:09	tudurom	you take a color with gcolor or something, then just change the hues
2016-03-26 08:53:15	fuyuki	saturation is how grey/muted it is
2016-03-26 08:53:27	fuyuki	like the default xterm colors have full saturation
2016-03-26 08:53:35	tudurom	omg so bright
2016-03-26 08:53:40	fuyuki	and grey would have a saturation of 0 i think
2016-03-26 08:53:48	tudurom	yeah
2016-03-26 08:53:55	arc	fuck it let me just mod an existing colorscheme
2016-03-26 08:54:02	fuyuki	yeah thats what i did
2016-03-26 08:54:05	arc	!!!!!maybe tudurom's!!!!!becaus i'm lazy!!!!!
2016-03-26 08:54:10	fuyuki	and then eventaully i replaced all the colors
2016-03-26 08:54:13	tudurom	that's cheating!
2016-03-26 08:54:16	arc	agh
2016-03-26 08:54:26	tudurom	arc, it's the second time you steal mine!
2016-03-26 08:54:26	fuyuki	tudurom: mine is actually original now
2016-03-26 08:54:33	tudurom	congrats
2016-03-26 08:54:40	arc	i'm using smear atm
2016-03-26 08:54:45	arc	hold on let me try this
2016-03-26 08:54:47	tudurom	fuyuki: atleast you know color theory
2016-03-26 08:54:57	fuyuki	kind of
2016-03-26 08:54:59	fuyuki	self taught
2016-03-26 08:55:09	fuyuki	> oh this button does this cool
2016-03-26 08:55:15	fuyuki	etcetc
2016-03-26 08:55:27	tudurom	i wrote a hsv to rgb function in c and that's how i learned
2016-03-26 08:55:33	fuyuki	ooh i foung something cool
2016-03-26 08:55:36	fuyuki	found*
2016-03-26 08:56:07	tudurom	uuuuu a button!
2016-03-26 08:56:20	fuyuki	my existing dark colorscheme had one color for dark and light colors (eg 2 and 10)
2016-03-26 08:56:37	tudurom	you can't just swap them
2016-03-26 08:56:48	fuyuki	and so if i take a color and shift the saturation down i can make another color that fits it
2016-03-26 08:56:58	fuyuki	or up
2016-03-26 08:57:25	tudurom	as long as the non-background color's value is bigger/smaller than the others'
2016-03-26 08:57:34	fuyuki	?
2016-03-26 08:57:46	tudurom	you need to tweak the value
2016-03-26 08:57:47	tudurom	a lot
2016-03-26 08:57:51	fuyuki	yes
2016-03-26 08:57:58	tudurom	that's why I made a color scheme from scratch
2016-03-26 08:57:59	fuyuki	i spend way too much time tweaking
2016-03-26 08:58:22	arc	AGH IT LOOKS HORRIBLE I GIVE UP
2016-03-26 08:58:34	fuyuki	arc start with a dark one
2016-03-26 08:58:39	fuyuki	dark is much easier
2016-03-26 08:58:42	fuyuki	imo

2016-03-26 09:14:43	arc	tudurom: yep
2016-03-26 09:15:04	arc	it's modified more than you think, however
2016-03-26 09:15:20	arc	`colorbars` doesn't output all colors
2016-03-26 09:15:37	arc	looks nice tho
2016-03-26 09:15:42	fuyuki	oh hai z3bra

2016-03-26 09:16:05	arc	i can't make colorschemes
2016-03-26 09:16:19	tudurom	just do it
2016-03-26 09:16:24	arc	I CAN'T
2016-03-26 09:16:41	tudurom	take a color, put it in terminal.sexy, modify the hues and done
2016-03-26 09:16:42	arc	THAT'S THE FUCKING THING I CAN'T FIGURE THIS SHIT OUT FUCK IT
2016-03-26 09:16:47	arc	tudurom: that is
2016-03-26 09:16:48	arc	what i did
2016-03-26 09:16:54	tudurom	grab a color from a wallpaper
2016-03-26 09:17:05	fuyuki	put it in http://www.colorhexa.com
2016-03-26 09:17:06	half	Lots of frogs here
2016-03-26 09:17:23	half	Where's my fellow Canadians? Give me an "Eh!"
2016-03-26 09:17:32	tudurom	oh
2016-03-26 09:17:43	fuyuki	i modified sourcerer and edited it enough that it was 100% original
2016-03-26 09:18:00	arc	i modified base16-mocha-light and edited it enough that it still needs editing but it's pretty damn good
2016-03-26 09:18:27	tudurom	get on my level
2016-03-26 09:18:38	arc	tudurom: you took colors and fucked with em

2016-03-26 09:18:48	arc	what's the difference
2016-03-26 09:18:55	fuyuki	ones a threesome
2016-03-26 09:19:13	half	Mmm
2016-03-26 09:19:15	tudurom	i took colors, not 8/16
2016-03-26 09:19:17	fuyuki	xero set that as the topic plz
2016-03-26 09:19:21	tudurom	*3 colors
2016-03-26 09:19:25	angel	but the challenge is to create a custom colorscheme
2016-03-26 09:19:31	tudurom	^
2016-03-26 09:19:32	arc	angel: and so i did
2016-03-26 09:19:33	angel	not to modify an existing one
2016-03-26 09:19:46	@z3bra	best colorscheme
2016-03-26 09:19:47	arc	angel: under that logic xero's sourcerer isn't a custom colorscheme
2016-03-26 09:19:57	@z3bra	*foreground: #ffffff
2016-03-26 09:19:58	arc	it's based off sorcerer

2016-03-26 09:21:52	arc	all colorschemes are technically derivatives
2016-03-26 09:21:59	angel	i don't know what i did to my colours
2016-03-26 09:21:59	angel	i lost them

2016-03-26 14:34:26	greduan	fucked up ok
2016-03-26 14:34:35	@rocx	more humiliating because, well, it was an outhouse with legs.
2016-03-26 14:34:54	@rocx	it was a dream so i took it as normal for a meandering watercloset.
2016-03-26 14:36:05	greduan	loool
2016-03-26 14:37:40	greduan	too bad my dad didn't read the manga, cause the anime is not very good

2016-03-26 15:26:32	rocx	but you're not supposed to know that.
2016-03-26 15:26:43	paul	Does that mean I die?
2016-03-26 15:26:53	rocx	of course, i'm the bad guy, with a gun, and confident that he won the fight. so i guess i got time to monologue.
2016-03-26 15:27:04	paul	Carry on, good sir!
2016-03-26 15:27:26	rocx	it all begins many moons ago, in a dark and dreary alley.
2016-03-26 15:27:27	rocx	...
2016-03-26 15:27:47	rocx	... and that's why i need to shoot you. it makes a time portal to kill hitler for some reason. even us bad guys have standards.
2016-03-26 15:28:06	paul	'murica!
2016-03-26 15:29:06	rocx	the kind of place that you could go to a "festival" and see a booth for custom AR-15s.
2016-03-26 15:29:40	rocx	then there's a booth for the republican party with more support for cruz than trump surprisingly enough.
2016-03-26 15:29:54	rocx	and a gideon booth, giving away bibles like candy.
2016-03-26 15:30:09	rocx	if the apocalypse ever happens, screw bottle caps. bibles will be the new currency.
2016-03-26 15:30:22	rocx	probably more of those than there are caps laying around.
2016-03-26 15:31:51	paul	aye.

2016-03-29 07:31:30	@rocx	kind of some silly typical fantasy thing. the main gimmick is that it's based off of some times some pals and i gathered long enough to do some silly roleplay thing.
2016-03-29 07:31:34	@rocx	D&D-style.
2016-03-29 07:31:46	@z3bra	fun :)
2016-03-29 07:31:51	half	Nice!
2016-03-29 07:31:56	@rocx	the rest of that is the tale of The Prophet.
2016-03-29 07:32:05	half	I really enjoyed 8-Bit Theater
2016-03-29 07:32:06	@rocx	an indirect villain of the last time.
2016-03-29 07:33:15	half	rocx: where's your old stuff?

2016-03-29 07:33:27	@rocx	scattered across cyberspace.
2016-03-29 07:33:32	half	Oh I see
2016-03-29 07:33:33	@rocx	lemme see if i could find some.
2016-03-29 07:33:36	@rocx	you could also ask adam.
2016-03-29 07:33:42	@rocx	he kind of kept an ~/img/rocx.

2016-03-29 07:34:15	albertocg	That's kinda weird don't you think?
2016-03-29 07:34:23	half	No

2016-03-29 07:34:30	half	He's obsessed, it's fine
2016-03-29 07:36:16	albertocg	those are some great illustrations rocx 
2016-03-29 07:36:26	@z3bra	hi albertocg!
2016-03-29 07:36:33	albertocg	z3bra: Hello :)
2016-03-29 07:36:37	@z3bra	just saw your presentation post on the forum
2016-03-29 07:36:43	half	rocx: lol nice
2016-03-29 07:37:41	albertocg	Well, here I am
2016-03-29 07:37:51	half	rocx: tablet or actual pencil?
2016-03-29 07:37:55	@rocx	tablet.
2016-03-29 07:38:00	@z3bra	so what do you expect from the community?
2016-03-29 07:38:05	greduan	nice drawings rocx
2016-03-29 07:38:18	half	Wait, that's not pencil
2016-03-29 07:38:18	@z3bra	rocx's good, you should all know it.
2016-03-29 07:38:20	half	Lol yeah
2016-03-29 07:38:54	+seth	lmao xero
2016-03-29 07:39:00	+seth	I got root on that box without sudo
2016-03-29 07:39:07	+seth	I changed my uid to 0 in ldap
2016-03-29 07:39:11	+seth	insta root
2016-03-29 07:39:17	@z3bra	lel
2016-03-29 07:39:25	@z3bra	*everywhere
2016-03-29 07:39:26	+seth	good ol' uid collisions
2016-03-29 07:39:29	+seth	yes haha
2016-03-29 07:39:47	@z3bra	though you need root access on the ldap server
2016-03-29 07:39:54	@z3bra	*root*
2016-03-29 07:40:04	+seth	yes, I have the admin password for ldap
2016-03-29 07:40:09	@z3bra	ofc
2016-03-29 07:40:11	+seth	the problem was this box was missing the sudo binary some how
2016-03-29 07:40:19	+seth	and I didn't feel like redoing the whole box
2016-03-29 07:41:33	@z3bra	yeah so you though "better mess up ldap everywhere by creating UID collisions" ? :P
2016-03-29 07:41:45	half	rocx: bet you could make some funny as fuck stuff with that art style
2016-03-29 07:41:51	@z3bra	what happens in this case btw?
2016-03-29 07:42:01	@z3bra	I never encountered it in the wild
2016-03-29 07:43:29	albertocg	I've been watching the community for some time and I found pretty cool to know some people to talk about geekier stuff and more precisely nixers stuff

2016-03-29 07:47:51	@z3bra	which cms do you use btw?
2016-03-29 07:47:51	@venam	I should set a bouncer on one of my vps now

2016-03-29 07:48:15	@z3bra	s/list/already long &/
2016-03-29 07:48:51	+seth	I'm partial to chef, z3bra 
2016-03-29 07:49:07	+seth	I've used Puppet, Chef, and "experienced" ansible
2016-03-29 07:49:12	@venam	z3bra: that means I'm probably doing that tomorrow
2016-03-29 07:49:17	@z3bra	and you prefer chef?
2016-03-29 07:49:17	@venam	because now I should be off to sleep
2016-03-29 07:49:39	@z3bra	oh okay ^^
2016-03-29 07:49:40	+seth	so far, yeah. I like that I can write loops and such, and the templating is good
2016-03-29 07:50:07	+seth	it's weird, but it's not as horrible as puppet was
2016-03-29 07:50:21	@z3bra	haha
2016-03-29 07:50:25	+seth	I use chef-solo to provision my own personal servers
2016-03-29 07:50:30	@z3bra	I see
2016-03-29 07:50:36	+seth	just drop a zip file off and run the recipes I want
2016-03-29 07:50:46	+seth	what do you prefer?
2016-03-29 07:50:54	@z3bra	I've only used chef
2016-03-29 07:51:04	+seth	puppet is like chef ... without features
2016-03-29 07:51:08	+seth	ansible is god-awful
2016-03-29 07:51:08	@z3bra	haha
2016-03-29 07:51:15	@z3bra	we're having trouble with it though
2016-03-29 07:51:21	+seth	in which regard?
2016-03-29 07:51:26	half	adam: they took our jerbs!
2016-03-29 07:51:49	@xero	seth: have you looking to salt stack? looks equally meh
2016-03-29 07:51:50	@z3bra	there are many places were a bootstrap can fail, and errors are hard to troubleshoot
2016-03-29 07:51:50	%adam	jorbs
2016-03-29 07:52:00	@z3bra	other than that, it's pretty nice when it works :P
2016-03-29 07:52:17	+seth	z3bra: that's true, but there's the "retries" feature of every resource
2016-03-29 07:52:25	@z3bra	what's that?
2016-03-29 07:52:30	+seth	generally when something depends on the network, I stick "retries 3" in there
2016-03-29 07:52:41	@z3bra	we don't have issues like that
2016-03-29 07:52:42	+seth	if a resource in a recipe fails, it will retry N times over X seconds
2016-03-29 07:53:00	@z3bra	we mostly use it to create openvz containers and deploy our software
2016-03-29 07:53:06	+fyr	hey
2016-03-29 07:53:11	@xero	yo]
2016-03-29 07:53:16	+seth	Oh, so weird kernel / software problems then?
2016-03-29 07:53:22	@z3bra	yeah :/
2016-03-29 07:53:26	+fyr	back finally at my machine
2016-03-29 07:53:34	@z3bra	we're trying to switch to lxc
2016-03-29 07:53:42	@z3bra	but it lacks many configs
2016-03-29 07:53:57	+seth	I've primarily used it to provision cloud servers, haven't really tried it for managing a hypervisor 
2016-03-29 07:54:01	@z3bra	it's way less featureful than openvz
2016-03-29 07:54:17	@z3bra	yeah chef is nice to manage services
2016-03-29 07:54:23	+seth	maybe you just need to write tests for the cookbooks
2016-03-29 07:54:34	@z3bra	for VM/container provisionning, it's a bit difficult
2016-03-29 07:54:47	+seth	I guess you would have to install hypervisor software on the CI server
2016-03-29 07:54:49	@z3bra	we end up with many system() calls
2016-03-29 07:54:57	@z3bra	test for file existence, etc..
2016-03-29 07:55:00	+seth	right, yeah
2016-03-29 07:55:43	@z3bra	still better than our old
2016-03-29 07:55:53	@z3bra	scp init.sh new_server:/root
2016-03-29 07:55:59	@z3bra	ssh new_root@server

2016-03-29 07:56:07	@z3bra	./init.sh
2016-03-29 07:56:09	@z3bra	:P
2016-03-29 07:56:24	+seth	hahah
2016-03-29 07:56:33	+seth	yeah we still have time consuming workflows here
2016-03-29 07:56:36	+seth	it's a bit awful
2016-03-29 07:56:38	@xero	looks like testkitchen has test suites for hypervisor as well

2016-03-29 13:04:58	tymscar	quick question
2016-03-29 13:05:05	@rocx	fire away.
2016-03-29 13:05:07	-	greduan (greduan@Clk-BCF83BB3.static.axtel.net) has joined #nixers
2016-03-29 13:05:23	tymscar	when i type screenfetch. it says i have 2742 packages. im sure i did not install that many
2016-03-29 13:05:25	tymscar	maybe 100
2016-03-29 13:05:44	feute	perhaps your os installed that bunch of apps by default
2016-03-29 13:05:57	@rocx	most of them are likely system and dependencies.
2016-03-29 13:06:03	tymscar	ok
2016-03-29 13:06:08	tymscar	and then question 2 which is hand in hand
2016-03-29 13:06:40	tymscar	if i want to make a "clone" of my system. how can i get a list of all my apps installed so i can easily install it on the second pc?
2016-03-29 13:07:02	tymscar	like a single command or something that i cna paste on that terminal and leave it for like an hour till it gets all the packages 
2016-03-29 13:08:03	albertocg	I'll think you'll be using the same package manager
2016-03-29 13:08:08	feute	haven't done that
2016-03-29 13:08:12	feute	but if you want to clone
2016-03-29 13:08:20	feute	just backup a partition
2016-03-29 13:08:32	tymscar	yeah but i dont want a 100% clone
2016-03-29 13:08:36	feute	dd if=/dev/xxx of=/backup
2016-03-29 13:08:40	tymscar	for example im on ubuntu. and i fancy trying arch
2016-03-29 13:08:47	tymscar	how can i get everything i have now onto arch?
2016-03-29 13:08:59	feute	then save it and, dd if=/backup of=/dev/xxx on the other machine
2016-03-29 13:12:18	tymscar	so im screwed if i want to move to arch?
2016-03-29 13:12:29	tymscar	because some people said i should if i want to learn more about linux

2016-03-29 13:16:46	tymscar	how can i keep all that i have now on ubuntu
2016-03-29 13:16:47	tymscar	?
2016-03-29 13:16:52	feute	you mean configs?
2016-03-29 13:16:58	@rocx	think he meant packages.
2016-03-29 13:17:04	@rocx	since he was talking about those.
2016-03-29 13:17:04	tymscar	yeah
2016-03-29 13:17:06	tymscar	pckgs
2016-03-29 13:17:15	tymscar	cause configs ive got those on github
2016-03-29 13:17:31	feute	hm
2016-03-29 13:17:52	feute	just list the packages you want, and install them with arch's package manager
2016-03-29 13:18:09	tymscar	waht if i want them all?
2016-03-29 13:18:16	tymscar	and i dotn want to stay here all day
2016-03-29 13:18:29	tymscar	isnt there a install all apckages command?
2016-03-29 13:18:38	feute	i don't know how ubuntu's package manager works
2016-03-29 13:18:43	tymscar	i know i can feed more packages at a time to apt-get install
2016-03-29 13:18:55	half	Yay for msgs with random links.
2016-03-29 13:18:57	feute	but with openbsd i just run `pkg_info` and it shows all the packages i've installed
2016-03-29 13:18:59	half	"I trust this!"
2016-03-29 13:19:49	feute	isn't there a /var/pkg/ dir on ubuntu?
2016-03-29 13:20:04	feute	or /var/db/pkg
2016-03-29 13:20:12	tymscar	bash: cd: /var/pkg: No such file or directory
2016-03-29 13:20:25	tymscar	same with the db one
2016-03-29 13:20:43	feute	i'm sure apt-get saves a db somewhere
2016-03-29 13:21:09	feute	cause i think it locks it when you try to run multiple instances of apt-get
2016-03-29 13:21:15	+fyr	feute, is back!
2016-03-29 13:21:23	+fyr	no more angel

2016-03-29 13:23:34	feute	just dpkg --get-selections > pkgs
2016-03-29 13:23:36	tymscar	why do you use freebsd?
2016-03-29 13:23:49	feute	and when you're on arch just pacman -S < pkgs
2016-03-29 13:23:52	feute	or something like that
2016-03-29 13:24:00	feute	openbsd

2016-03-29 13:38:40	feute	i don't like emacs
2016-03-29 13:38:44	half	Mm
2016-03-29 13:38:47	@rocx	i'm, what greduan calls, "one of those emacs monsters".
2016-03-29 13:38:55	feute	like, it says it's a text editor, but its size is 109mb
2016-03-29 13:39:06	half	feute: Use case dependent, I'd use it if I was tunnelled in all day long
2016-03-29 13:39:06	@rocx	feute: it's a lisp environment, not a text editor.
2016-03-29 13:39:10	half	feute: ssh and such
2016-03-29 13:39:20	@rocx	it's just the fact you can edit files with it as buffers is just part of the feature.
2016-03-29 13:39:28	half	But on a raw system, eh. The kernel is more adept at wwhat emacs tries to do, as is X
2016-03-29 13:39:38	albertocg	One of this days I'll get back to arch or continue with crux and will share some good ricing

2016-03-29 13:52:47	half	rocx: Erm screen recordings
2016-03-29 13:53:01	@rocx	i'd rather fill up my disks with useful things.
2016-03-29 13:53:10	tymscar	same as rocx

2016-03-29 13:53:12	fsociety	rocx, p0rn?
2016-03-29 13:53:18	@rocx	fsociety: nah.
2016-03-29 13:53:26	half	Only 73M of programming stuff now, heh. Trimmed that down.
2016-03-29 13:53:43	@rocx	most of my package baggage is from tinkering with other languages.
2016-03-29 13:53:45	albertocg	Is music worth?
2016-03-29 13:53:56	tymscar	nope. you have spotify and youtubefor that
2016-03-29 13:54:03	half	albertocg: Depends, do you have audio gear that makes any use out of high fidelity music?
2016-03-29 13:54:39	albertocg	No, but I move a lot to places without internet
2016-03-29 13:54:50	tymscar	then maybe
2016-03-29 13:55:17	tymscar	for example i am wierd : i hate listening to music when i do stuff like programming. i cant concentrate. so i dont need it with me
2016-03-29 13:55:26	albertocg	I don't really like using the computer hd for that stuff tho
2016-03-29 13:55:52	@rocx	tymscar: ambient stuff works for that.
2016-03-29 13:55:59	@rocx	that or repetitive or noisy type metal.
2016-03-29 13:56:03	albertocg	nu metal works for me
2016-03-29 13:56:17	@rocx	ironically slipknot kind of falls into the category as i'm hearing right now.
2016-03-29 13:56:30	@rocx	not my type but it's good for concentrating being mostly noise.
2016-03-29 13:56:38	tymscar	i get you
2016-03-29 13:56:49	tymscar	but i still like keeping on my headphones with nothing in them
2016-03-29 13:56:55	@rocx	i do that a lot too.
2016-03-29 13:56:55	albertocg	yeah, I can't concentrate if it's too melodic
2016-03-29 13:56:56	tymscar	they are some mid range Sennheisers
2016-03-29 13:57:17	@rocx	albertocg: if you're feeling pumped from the song, you're going to focus on the song more than the task at hand.
2016-03-29 13:57:39	@rocx	for ambience, 2f30's stream works.
2016-03-29 13:57:59	@rocx	but their site's down.
2016-03-29 13:58:29	fsociety	i need to start trimming on content on my drives.. i noticed it the other day.. could add more though.

2016-03-29 13:58:44	@rocx	tymscar: another group.
2016-03-29 13:58:46	albertocg	pc hdd = immediate use which is mostly code. external hdd = every other documents. that's it.
2016-03-29 13:58:51	@rocx	tymscar: how'd you get that?
2016-03-29 13:59:01	@rocx	and are those samba shares?
2016-03-29 13:59:03	tymscar	@rocx get what?
2016-03-29 13:59:04	half	You could use a NAS though
2016-03-29 13:59:16	@rocx	tymscar: sorry, meant fsociety.
2016-03-29 13:59:19	half	That's what I'm planning, when I get hardware
2016-03-29 13:59:20	fsociety	rocx, autofs mounts
2016-03-29 13:59:34	fsociety	to my homemade NAS
2016-03-29 13:59:52	@rocx	and the graph?
2016-03-29 13:59:55	fsociety	I use mhddfs to pool the drives
2016-03-29 14:00:08	fsociety	rocx, dfc
2016-03-29 14:00:40	@rocx	huh. apparently i only dedicated 217.8G to my partition.
2016-03-29 14:01:12	@rocx	heh. only using 35G right now.
2016-03-29 14:01:25	fsociety	i need to buy a larger OS ssd, the 120gb just aint cutting it anymore :( only because of UE4

2016-03-29 14:03:02	@rocx	tymscar: what about UT1999?
2016-03-29 14:03:09	fsociety	compiled it 
2016-03-29 14:03:12	fsociety	;)
2016-03-29 14:03:14	@rocx	if i can get that on gnu/linux, i would be wiping the floor with z3bra.
2016-03-29 14:03:34	@rocx	he may be a quake god, but i am the maestro of the unreal tourney.
2016-03-29 14:03:41	fsociety	its not that hard to compile, you register to their git account and follow their wiki :)
2016-03-29 14:03:50	tymscar	cause ive got unity but im too afraid to distch my windows dual boot and use the one on linux because I need it for school
2016-03-29 14:03:54	tymscar	and i cant risk it
2016-03-29 14:04:57	fsociety	tymscar, https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux
2016-03-29 14:05:22	tymscar	cool. thanks fsociety 
2016-03-29 14:05:28	fsociety	tymscar, no probs :)
2016-03-29 14:05:58	tymscar	im going to use it next semester in uni so its going to help me fsociety 
2016-03-29 14:06:20	fsociety	i ended up creating a seperate local environment to compile it - mainly due to its need for specific levels of Clang
2016-03-29 14:06:39	fsociety	tymscar, what distro are you using?
2016-03-29 14:06:46	tymscar	ubuntu right now
2016-03-29 14:06:55	tymscar	i would like to change to arch in the imidiate future
2016-03-29 14:07:05	fsociety	tymscar, its easier to compile for ubuntu than it is on arch
2016-03-29 14:07:34	fsociety	arch can be a bit of pain unless you downgrade packages or as i said earlier setup a temporary environment to compile :P
2016-03-29 14:07:43	fsociety	there is a good how to on the gentoo forum, i'll get it for you
2016-03-29 14:07:48	tymscar	ill keep that in mind
2016-03-29 14:07:53	tymscar	wait
2016-03-29 14:07:55	tymscar	dont do that now
2016-03-29 14:07:57	tymscar	i need to go

2016-03-29 15:41:59	half	Lol
2016-03-29 15:42:14	half	Questionable activities is about as much as you ought to divulge at this point in time.

2016-03-29 15:46:57	half	That's nice to know.
2016-03-29 15:47:05	half	Ghost is a freenode thing, maybe. 
2016-03-29 15:47:07	half	It works there
2016-03-29 15:47:35	venam	half: depends on the nickserv
2016-03-29 15:47:43	half	Yeah, that's likely the distinction

2016-03-29 15:51:11	half	Why the fuck do I hear Teen Mom in the background.
2016-03-29 15:51:16	half	Never have girlfriends, folks.
2016-03-29 15:51:35	fsociety	half, let us hope it isn't the teen mom porno playing in the background. haha
2016-03-29 15:51:56	half	No, but it's the same girl that did it talking. She's a horrible human being.
2016-03-29 15:52:27	fsociety	half, i agree there
2016-03-29 15:52:29	albertocg	If I ever have a girlfriend again I'll come to you for advise, half 
2016-03-29 15:52:42	half	albertocg: Lol.  
2016-03-29 15:53:41	albertocg	but only if she starts talking about teen mom
2016-03-29 15:53:42	half	albertocg: Yeah I'm a shining beacon of good information.
2016-03-29 15:53:57	albertocg	4real? you just told us to not have a gf
2016-03-29 15:54:18	half	No, the last statement was sarcasm.
2016-03-29 15:54:32	half	You know how these things work.
2016-03-29 16:08:12	venam	ok... the unicorn gf talk by unix geeks has started

2016-03-29 16:15:56	half	venam: the cheap haircuts for me and our son save a fuckload, then she drops $300 on a cut and color
2016-03-29 16:16:04	half	Evens out?
2016-03-29 16:16:12	venam	half: mine doesn't
2016-03-29 16:16:21	venam	she massages my back instead and ask me if it hurts
2016-03-29 16:16:50	half	We have money though, it's not like we're broke, I just don't justify buying PC shit out anything for myself ever

2016-03-30 11:45:43	arc	try herbstluftwm, bspwm, dwm, monsterwm, et al
2016-03-30 11:46:11	acg	huh.. wondering if I can get any of those on Fedora. If not, then I'm getting some reasons to migrate
2016-03-30 11:46:21	greduan	acg: just compile em :)
2016-03-30 11:46:26	arc	you can get anything
2016-03-30 11:46:27	arc	just compile
2016-03-30 11:46:32	+fyr	setup a /builds directory
2016-03-30 11:46:37	arc	i enjoy crux
2016-03-30 11:46:44	arc	but i wouldn't recommend it
2016-03-30 11:46:45	arc	try void maybe
2016-03-30 11:46:51	+fyr	use debian
2016-03-30 11:46:53	arc	monsterwm and dwm require recompilation to change
2016-03-30 11:46:59	arc	fyr: debian's ok
2016-03-30 11:47:02	acg	Will do.
2016-03-30 11:47:14	acg	I didn't like crux packaging system. Liked more Arch's
2016-03-30 11:47:15	@fro	acg: you can get all of these on fedora
2016-03-30 11:47:30	+fyr	acg, eh
2016-03-30 11:47:31	fsociety	or to be even more helpful acg 
2016-03-30 11:47:33	fsociety	http://copr-fe.cloud.fedoraproject.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=bspwm
2016-03-30 11:47:46	+fyr	arch's packaging is a more bloated implementation of crux's
2016-03-30 11:47:53	arc	fyr: arch is fine
2016-03-30 11:47:54	arc	period
2016-03-30 11:48:03	+fyr	to say you don't like crux's is odd
2016-03-30 11:48:18	+fyr	we can agree to disagree on this one arc 
2016-03-30 11:48:18	arc	fyr: that's because crux's is bad
2016-03-30 11:48:22	+fyr	sigh
2016-03-30 11:48:23	arc	but anyway
2016-03-30 11:48:24	arc	it doesnt matter
2016-03-30 11:48:28	+fyr	not this argument again
2016-03-30 11:48:29	arc	like what you like
2016-03-30 11:48:41	+fyr	you don't /need/ package handling like you want it
2016-03-30 11:48:54	fsociety	i did wish crux had an option of enabling and disabling compiling flags.. that would be handy :P
2016-03-30 11:48:56	arc	dependency handling you mean
2016-03-30 11:49:02	arc	fsociety: i learned that lesson the hard way 
2016-03-30 11:49:06	arc	it NEEDS use flags
2016-03-30 11:49:11	arc	i tried packaging sbcl
2016-03-30 11:49:21	+fyr	no
2016-03-30 11:49:26	+fyr	just maintain your own ports
2016-03-30 11:49:28	arc	let me give you an idea
2016-03-30 11:49:34	arc	as to why it needs use flags
2016-03-30 11:49:37	fsociety	arc, yeah that is one thing that I don't like about crux
2016-03-30 11:49:42	arc	okay so
2016-03-30 11:49:49	arc	i tried packaging sbcl (steel bank common lisp)
2016-03-30 11:49:50	acg	It's just my personal opinion about systems. Maybe it's because I didn't understand well crux's philosophy
2016-03-30 11:49:52	arc	sbcl itself is written in common lisp
2016-03-30 11:50:00	arc	so it needs a common lisp compiler to be compiled
2016-03-30 11:50:08	arc	once installed, it can compile itself
2016-03-30 11:50:09	@rocx	don't feel bad.
2016-03-30 11:50:13	arc	but when not installed, it needs opt/clisp
2016-03-30 11:50:18	@rocx	C compilers are written C now but the first one was written in assembly.
2016-03-30 11:50:26	@rocx	it could be worse.
2016-03-30 11:50:27	arc	so I had to use a type statement
2016-03-30 11:50:41	arc	rather than using USE flags to have an optional dep
2016-03-30 11:50:52	arc	also footprints are bad
2016-03-30 11:51:19	greduan	Every compiler was compiled with something else at some point.
2016-03-30 11:51:20	+fyr	so when you first compile it you need another package?
2016-03-30 11:51:26	arc	yes
2016-03-30 11:51:33	+fyr	list it as a dep, then remove it using a post-install script
2016-03-30 11:51:43	arc	that is a HORRIBLE idea

2016-03-30 11:51:59	+fyr	not really
2016-03-30 11:52:21	arc	i listed it as optional and fucked with type -p clisp 2> /dev/null
2016-03-30 11:52:42	+fyr	you don't need to do that
2016-03-30 11:53:00	+fyr	post-install scripts on crux are enabled by default but you can turn them off

2016-03-30 11:53:57	arc	i have a dare for you

2016-03-30 11:55:09	+fyr	oh I was thinking about it
2016-03-30 11:55:54	arc	but yes the clisp fuckery here
2016-03-30 11:55:58	arc	is why crux needs use flags
2016-03-30 11:56:02	+fyr	no
2016-03-30 11:56:09	+fyr	I just gave you the 'crux' solution
2016-03-30 11:56:22	arc	the post-install script is a particularly bad solution
2016-03-30 11:56:23	arc	why?
2016-03-30 11:56:31	arc	that way it'd be compiled with CLISP every time
2016-03-30 11:56:35	+fyr	that's what the devs recommend rofl
2016-03-30 11:56:51	arc	I don't want to compile SBCL w/ CLISP every time 
2016-03-30 11:56:55	arc	I want to compile SBCL with SBCL
2016-03-30 11:57:31	+fyr	ah so if a new release comes out you want to install it with the existing package
2016-03-30 11:57:33	+fyr	hmm
2016-03-30 11:57:35	arc	yes
2016-03-30 11:57:48	arc	probably could do some

2016-03-30 11:59:13	arc	because they're bash scripts anyway
2016-03-30 11:59:18	arc	not much I can do about that
2016-03-30 11:59:20	@fro	shouldn't be
2016-03-30 11:59:24	+fyr	they might not be for much longer when I get my way
2016-03-30 11:59:26	arc	fro: I know
2016-03-30 11:59:31	+fyr	write POSIX sh wherever you can
2016-03-30 11:59:33	+fyr	it's not hard
2016-03-30 11:59:42	arc	fyr: you have to add a --bash flag to your new pkgmk though

2016-03-30 12:51:33	@rocx	he's too cool or something.
2016-03-30 12:51:34	%adam	he is a nixer that uses os x tho
2016-03-30 12:51:37	tymscar	i know the terminal more than a first time ubnutu guy
2016-03-30 12:51:38	half	adam: Linux isn't the answer level newbie, and UNIX is not Uther.
2016-03-30 12:51:43	half	Either*
2016-03-30 12:51:48	tymscar	and i also set up i3. i learned vim
2016-03-30 12:52:42	tymscar	i kinda know waht x11 is
2016-03-30 12:52:47	tymscar	so xquartz is that on mac?
2016-03-30 12:52:50	%adam	yeah
2016-03-30 12:52:54	%adam	yeah so download and install that
2016-03-30 12:53:02	%adam	then im pretty sure you just install i3 using like pkgsrc
2016-03-30 12:53:05	%adam	or brew
2016-03-30 12:53:07	%adam	or macports
2016-03-30 12:53:11	%adam	and then use xinitrc?
2016-03-30 12:53:17	fsociety	i guess im a "guys i installed crux and fuck systemd" non-newbie.. lol
2016-03-30 12:53:18	%adam	does xinitrc still work?
2016-03-30 12:53:36	tymscar	what is xinitrc?
2016-03-30 12:53:44	tymscar	i suppose its something to configure the x
2016-03-30 12:53:47	tymscar	?
2016-03-30 12:53:49	tymscar	like a initializer
2016-03-30 12:53:49	%adam	yea
2016-03-30 12:53:51	%adam	yea
2016-03-30 12:53:54	%adam	if you do startx
2016-03-30 12:53:54	tymscar	an*
2016-03-30 12:53:57	%adam	thats just a wrapper around xinit
2016-03-30 12:54:06	%adam	really all you could have in it to boot i3 is just
2016-03-30 12:54:07	%adam	exec i3
2016-03-30 12:54:15	%adam	or exec /path/to/i3
2016-03-30 12:54:33	half	fsociety: I'm past all that crap.
2016-03-30 12:54:51	half	Not yet to dcat level of, I give up - install osx and weep though
2016-03-30 12:55:10	fsociety	half, then at what point are you at? :)
2016-03-30 12:55:41	half	I want to work on an OS that meets my needs
2016-03-30 12:56:05	fsociety	half, so do i which is why i'm currently on gentoo - i installed crux more as an academic exercise
2016-03-30 12:56:37	fsociety	regarding systemd - it never works nicely from update to update which is why i removed it.  would remove certain services before they should and would hang my pc on reset
2016-03-30 12:56:44	fsociety	that is the main reason why i'm fuck systemd. haha
2016-03-30 12:56:49	half	Heh.
2016-03-30 12:57:00	fsociety	that and binary logs irritate me
2016-03-30 12:57:05	half	Poettering doesn't give a fuck about any edge case
2016-03-30 12:57:07	tymscar	xquartz is installing now <3
2016-03-30 12:57:16	fsociety	Poettering just wants to make his own OS
2016-03-30 12:57:24	half	He casters only to exactly the use case he deems proper.
2016-03-30 12:57:28	half	Caters*
2016-03-30 12:57:49	half	That's annoying but, it works fine for most
2016-03-30 12:58:09	fsociety	from what i've read thats the problem - its his way or no way .. haha
2016-03-30 12:58:23	fsociety	i think my biggest issue was making large projects require it for no particuarly reason
2016-03-30 12:58:26	fsociety	like gnome i guess
2016-03-30 12:58:30	fsociety	even though i don't use it
2016-03-30 12:58:53	@rocx	gnome'd be nice if it weren't for all the under-the-hood crap.

2016-03-30 12:59:18	half	There's no reason for them not to simplify things with it. They get the market they want, even if the few edge cases that care are fucked.
2016-03-30 12:59:20	arc	no v-word

2016-03-30 13:00:56	half	Yeah, but it won't completely displace other options.
2016-03-30 13:01:01	@rocx	fsociety: this implies that wayland will become the standard.

2016-03-30 13:04:10	arc	if that exists
2016-03-30 13:04:10	tymscar	sorry arc.

2016-03-30 14:47:15	fsociety	a fairly old revision, probably like 12.04 or something
2016-03-30 14:49:50	%adam	is that still supported
2016-03-30 14:50:08	%vypr	that's the LTS
2016-03-30 14:50:09	%vypr	so
2016-03-30 14:50:12	%vypr	i believe so
2016-03-30 14:50:32	+fyr	thanks dakota reminding me to upgrade my weechat version
2016-03-30 14:50:42	%vypr	or, it was the LTS anyway
2016-03-30 14:50:48	%adam	thanks dakota for reminding me not to use weechat
2016-03-30 14:50:57	@fro	how long is LTS supported?
2016-03-30 14:51:00	%vypr	nvm, 14.04.4 is the LTS
2016-03-30 14:51:21	%vypr	fro: 3 years for desktop, 5 for server

2016-03-30 14:51:54	%vypr	technically 12.04 is supported
2016-03-30 14:51:55	@fro	so you can continue using old versions of things
2016-03-30 14:51:55	%vypr	still
2016-03-30 14:51:57	%vypr	yes
2016-03-30 14:52:06	%vypr	and all security-related fixes will still occur
2016-03-30 14:54:07	@fro	i think i stopped using ubuntu around 10.10

2016-03-30 14:55:24	+fyr	knew what it was for years but installing arch admittedly got me into all this
2016-03-30 14:55:35	fsociety	my first shot at linux was mandriva back in 2005

2016-04-06 11:38:08	@xero	it's a diy os
2016-04-06 11:38:20	@xero	it's as broken/fixed as you make it
2016-04-06 11:39:09	fsociety	xero, true.. but i don't have the time to really try and fix things.. i use my desktop a lot for work and so I kind of need that nice inbetween sweet spot.
2016-04-06 11:39:21	fsociety	i couldn't even get dbus-32 to install correctly
2016-04-06 11:39:48	fsociety	i tried different LDFLAGS and CFLAGS but it didn't seem to work
2016-04-06 11:39:51	@xero	fsociety: i dont think crux was designed to be used at work
2016-04-06 11:40:17	fsociety	xero, well this pc is used for work and my personal things.  i work from home sometimes.. but yeah, crux isn't for me :)
2016-04-06 11:40:51	fsociety	i shall stick to ze gentoo

2016-04-06 11:45:36	fsociety	xero, i am curious as to why you dont like gentoo

2016-04-06 12:02:47	fsociety	even though the funtoo community is much smaller it is still more active than the gentoo one
2016-04-06 12:03:03	jmbi	all i know is it takes 3 mins to install and the package repo is fast and well populated
2016-04-06 12:03:07	jmbi	so good enough for me

2016-04-06 12:05:18	jmbi	i would use openbsd but freebsd is faster and has proprietary driver support (nvidia for me), plus i don't care about security too much on my desktop

2016-04-06 12:06:04	fsociety	this means i could steam on bsd
2016-04-06 12:07:15	jmbi	https://www.freebsd.org/releases/10.3R/announce.html

2016-04-06 12:07:46	jmbi	probably won't be long before steam comes
2016-04-06 12:07:56	jmbi	might require some hacking

2016-04-06 14:57:42	fsociety	its all about scripting, fyr's script are a good starting point for wmutils :)

2016-04-06 15:03:36	acg	couldn't install it when I tried. Then installed xmonad and ended up with dwm since I'd rather C++ than Haskell
2016-04-06 15:07:49	fsociety	yeah the dependency list of xmonad always turned me off thanks to haskell
2016-04-06 15:07:49		[15:07]
2016-04-06 15:08:30	acg	dwm's cons is that I have to recompile everytime I change config.h
2016-04-06 15:08:53	Dworin	How long does that take, acg? About a second?
2016-04-06 15:09:17	Dworin	btw, I thought dwm was C, not C++?
2016-04-06 15:09:33	nuup	what's the deal with the compiled in source in some WM's?
2016-04-06 15:09:37	nuup	performance reasons?
2016-04-06 15:10:24	acg	Dworin, it's C, sorry. Falling asleep
2016-04-06 15:10:58	acg	and reloading X
2016-04-06 15:11:56	Dworin	No need to reload X either.
2016-04-06 15:14:04	acg	Dworin, how do you do it?
2016-04-06 15:14:48	Dworin	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dwm#Restart_dwm_without_logging_out_or_closing_programs
2016-04-06 15:15:59	Dworin	The only thing is that programs jump back to their default tag if you had retagged them. Otherwise, dwm just restarts and you can continue right where you left off.
2016-04-06 15:17:26	acg	thanks for the resource. Will make use of it since I'm having to reconfigure my dwm

2016-04-07 07:05:17	humhum	https://github.com/phallus/fonts
2016-04-07 07:05:21	boobah	humhum: oh yeah
2016-04-07 07:05:26	boobah	humhum: those have been around for a long time
2016-04-07 07:05:27	humhum	i git cloned the files
2016-04-07 07:05:33	humhum	yeah they have
2016-04-07 07:05:39	boobah	humhum: iirc there's now an install script
2016-04-07 07:05:48	humhum	they should work right xd
2016-04-07 07:05:56	humhum	yeah i run the install script
2016-04-07 07:06:05	humhum	chmod it and run it
2016-04-07 07:06:21	humhum	fonts get installed ~/.fonts
2016-04-07 07:06:30	+fyr	LEMON BEST FONT!
2016-04-07 07:06:42	@xero	 ~/.local/share/fonts/
2016-04-07 07:06:50	@xero	has replaced ~/.fonts
2016-04-07 07:06:50	humhum	but lxappearance doesn't list the fonts :s
2016-04-07 07:06:51	vompatti	what you guys up to
2016-04-07 07:06:54	@xero	for some systems
2016-04-07 07:06:54	boobah	humhum: check xfontsel
2016-04-07 07:07:29	boobah	humhum: it doesn't matter where they're installed as long as the parent directory is in the X Font Path upon initialization
2016-04-07 07:07:30	humhum	sorry boobah what does xfontsel do?
2016-04-07 07:07:36	boobah	it lets you select fonts
2016-04-07 07:07:38	humhum	i think it is run in the install script
2016-04-07 07:07:52	boobah	do you have it installed?
2016-04-07 07:07:58	boobah	xfontsel, that is
2016-04-07 07:07:59	humhum	xfontsel?
2016-04-07 07:08:00	humhum	yes
2016-04-07 07:08:16	boobah	run it and check for "lemon" under the fmly menu
2016-04-07 07:08:28	humhum	let me try to install the fonts again
2016-04-07 07:08:48	boobah	you can just do it manually, it's not that hard
2016-04-07 07:08:55	@xero	this script is not gonna work
2016-04-07 07:08:57	boobah	i've never used the script personally
2016-04-07 07:08:58	@xero	bdftopcf -o ~/.fonts/lemon.pcf lemon.bdf
2016-04-07 07:09:04	@xero	https://github.com/phallus/fonts/blob/master/install
2016-04-07 07:09:16	boobah	there's nothing wrong with that line xero
2016-04-07 07:09:19	humhum	the script is broken xero?
2016-04-07 07:09:30	@xero	i didnt mean to paste that line
2016-04-07 07:10:03	humhum	so to install the fonts should i run the script or do it manually_
2016-04-07 07:10:05	humhum	?
2016-04-07 07:10:20	boobah	well i don't know what xero noticed but the script actually looks okay to me
2016-04-07 07:10:33	@xero	i think i'm wrong
2016-04-07 07:10:35	@xero	nvm
2016-04-07 07:10:42	humhum	well to me it copied the files .fonts
2016-04-07 07:10:47	boobah	you might need to put `xset +fp ~/.fonts` in your ~/.xinitrc
2016-04-07 07:10:54	humhum	which is the intent
2016-04-07 07:10:59	@xero	the script does that
2016-04-07 07:11:04	@xero	shouldnt need to be run more than once
2016-04-07 07:11:04	humhum	ok let me run the install script
2016-04-07 07:11:12	boobah	xero: that script doesn't touch xinitrc
2016-04-07 07:11:39	boobah	xero: the x font path needs to be set each time unless you're putting everything in the standard places
2016-04-07 07:11:45	@xero	yeah, once you rehash it should be good
2016-04-07 07:11:53	boobah	xero: sometimes, ~/.fonts is not checked unless you tell it to explicitly
2016-04-07 07:12:06	@xero	mkfontdir though
2016-04-07 07:12:36	boobah	doesn't mkfontdir just make a fonts.dir file in ~/.fonts?
2016-04-07 07:12:50	boobah	(containing a list and count of fonts in that directory)
2016-04-07 07:12:56	@xero	yes
2016-04-07 07:13:04	@xero	then you give that to xset 
2016-04-07 07:13:10	@xero	and it should be saved
2016-04-07 07:13:19	@xero	but i could be wrong
2016-04-07 07:13:19		[07:13]
2016-04-07 07:13:31	boobah	i was under the impression that X doesn't remember this kind of thing
2016-04-07 07:13:35	boobah	but i also may be incorrect
2016-04-07 07:13:36	sshbio	boobah: What I get when I run mkfontdir . is a ./fonts.dir

2016-04-07 07:25:12	ygstr	week*
2016-04-07 07:25:12	feute	boobah: i've tried it with that and got errors, then typed the dir as it is and it worked
2016-04-07 07:25:21	boobah	feute: that's not how the shell works, sorry
2016-04-07 07:25:22	ygstr	when I backup my dots and passwords
2016-04-07 07:25:39	sshbio	ygstr: It feels good to compile linux for the first time!
2016-04-07 07:25:39	boobah	feute: don't believe me? run `echo xset +fp ~/.fonts` and see for yourself
2016-04-07 07:25:50	ygstr	sshbio: It's not my first time
2016-04-07 07:25:58	ygstr	I used funtoo for a few months
2016-04-07 07:26:03	feute	ooh no wait
2016-04-07 07:26:04	feute	it doesn't accept relative paths
2016-04-07 07:26:04	feute	that's it
2016-04-07 07:26:09	boobah	that's correct.
2016-04-07 07:26:16	@xero	xset +fp /home/xero/.fonts

2016-04-07 07:26:35	ygstr	sshbio: who knows 
2016-04-07 07:26:38	@xero	what shell feute ?
2016-04-07 07:26:43	ygstr	portage broke and I didn't want to fix it
2016-04-07 07:26:45	feute	mksh
2016-04-07 07:26:51	@xero	well there you go
2016-04-07 07:26:54	@xero	minimal shell
2016-04-07 07:26:57	boobah	no xero
2016-04-07 07:27:01	@xero	;D
2016-04-07 07:27:06	boobah	the shell is insignificant here

2016-04-07 07:27:20	ygstr	:)
2016-04-07 07:27:22	boobah	all popular bourne shells do this
2016-04-07 07:27:28	humhum	ok going for a reboot let's hope, i used the absolute path btw.
2016-04-07 07:27:33	humhum	to play it safe.
2016-04-07 07:27:48	@xero	seriously though
2016-04-07 07:27:58	@xero	mksh is a korn shell, not a borne shell
2016-04-07 07:28:08	ygstr	xero: is right

2016-04-07 07:28:54	boobah	xero: if it wasn't, we wouldn't be using it to run /bin/sh scripts
2016-04-07 07:29:08	boobah	xero: which some of us (myself excluded) engage in
2016-04-07 07:29:15	@rocx	using ksh, can confirm.

2016-04-07 07:29:32	+fyr	syslinking dash to /bin/sh is far better
2016-04-07 07:29:39	sshbio	What is good about korn shells?
2016-04-07 07:29:42	boobah	fyr: yes, but i've seen it done
2016-04-07 07:29:42	@rocx	wasn't the korn shell considered *the* POSIX shell at some point?
2016-04-07 07:29:53	+fyr	boobah, then those people are dumb
2016-04-07 07:29:57	boobah	xero: this is a horrible method of proving me wrong btw
2016-04-07 07:30:20	@xero	yeah, since i did find it on the page
2016-04-07 07:30:30	boobah	xero: and you forgot `-i` anyway

2016-04-07 07:31:06	@xero	but i dont get your argument about need a bourne shell for posix compat
2016-04-07 07:31:48	@xero	my interactive shell does posix too. but when i run /bin/sh i use dash for the speed
2016-04-07 07:32:01	sshbio	xero: what was the last time that you pressed the shift key?
2016-04-07 07:32:16	@xero	sshbio: the what key?
2016-04-07 07:32:24	@xero	(just pressed it to make a ?)
2016-04-07 07:32:28	boobah	xero: mksh is posix-compliant. i don't know what you're asking.

2016-04-07 07:33:47	@xero	you need a posix compat shell

2016-04-07 07:33:55	@xero	they may overlap
2016-04-07 07:34:00	boobah	xero: but mksh happens to be a bourne-based shell
2016-04-07 07:34:02	@rocx	AHEM.
2016-04-07 07:34:08	@rocx	wasn't ksh *the* POSIX shell at one point?
2016-04-07 07:34:22	boobah	xero: regardless, the behavior i described should be consistent across all posix-compliant shells
2016-04-07 07:34:27	boobah	xero: that's the real point here

2016-04-07 07:57:09	@rocx	fffs. i might move back to a mouse once this trackball bites the dust.
2016-04-07 07:57:15	tymscar	why?
2016-04-07 07:57:32	tymscar	i tought trackballs were better for anything except gaming
2016-04-07 07:57:37	@rocx	mice are a dime a dozen and a lot can be designed right.
2016-04-07 07:57:45	@rocx	tymscar: nah trackballs are better for gaming
2016-04-07 07:57:53	@rocx	but the problem is more of the way this one is shaped.
2016-04-07 07:57:53	tymscar	not really
2016-04-07 07:58:00	tymscar	tried it. cant play competitive
2016-04-07 07:58:07	+fyr	rocx, eh
2016-04-07 07:58:09	+fyr	eh
2016-04-07 07:58:11	+fyr	eh
2016-04-07 07:58:12	@rocx	tymscar: clearly you haven't seen how slightly better i've gotten at TF2 back when i used to play it.

2016-04-07 07:58:44	+fyr	rocx, replace your statement with "trackballs are better for gaming for me"
2016-04-07 07:58:53	@rocx	nah, this is an objective fact.

2016-04-07 07:59:10	@rocx	hush.
2016-04-07 07:59:15	@rocx	you know i can say nothing wrong, right?
2016-04-07 07:59:22	+fyr	where is your evidence? ^^
2016-04-07 07:59:24	@rocx	...riiiiiiight?
2016-04-07 07:59:34	@rocx	don't need any. i'm objectively correct and right 100% of the time.
2016-04-07 07:59:41	tymscar	ok

2016-04-07 08:00:02	humhum	did everything manually instead of running the script, still doesn't work the only files listed are the fonts that were already ~/.fonts
2016-04-07 08:00:17	@rocx	and the scroll wheel on this ball is squeaking too.
2016-04-07 08:00:32	@rocx	i'm a claw-er rather than a palm-er, so this ball also doesn't fit me too well.
2016-04-07 08:00:38	+fyr	where did xero go?!?!?
2016-04-07 08:00:43	+fyr	he's always here
2016-04-07 08:00:49	+fyr	and now he's not :(
2016-04-07 08:00:59	@rocx	there's a bunch of reasons why i kind of sort of regret this trackball.
2016-04-07 08:01:00	humhum	well he was helping me out here a few mins ago.
2016-04-07 08:04:15	tymscar	any ideas why i get likes 300fps less in csgo on linux than on windows?>

2016-04-07 08:07:50	tymscar	apparently yes
2016-04-07 08:07:58	tymscar	yep. everything works flawlessly
2016-04-07 08:08:03	nc	haha
2016-04-07 08:08:08	sshbio	tymscar: Congratulation!
2016-04-07 08:08:08	nc	glad it's working
2016-04-07 08:08:10	tymscar	except that i get 200-300 less fps in cs go than on windows
2016-04-07 08:08:23	nc	tymscar: that might be partially due to csgo too
2016-04-07 08:08:32	tymscar	and even tho i have over 60 fps its still laggy
2016-04-07 08:08:33	nc	does it use opengl on windows as well?
2016-04-07 08:08:37	tymscar	yes
2016-04-07 08:08:41	nc	hmmm
2016-04-07 08:08:49	tymscar	on nvidia it wokrs better they say
2016-04-07 08:08:55	tymscar	oh whell.. i keep my windows instalation then
2016-04-07 08:08:58	tymscar	for that and for unity 3d
2016-04-07 08:09:09	nc	yeah
2016-04-07 08:09:11	tymscar	cause i tried to yaourt unity and it failed on the compilation
2016-04-07 08:09:15	nc	ohn
2016-04-07 08:09:19	sshbio	As I failed at configuring X11, I stopped using it. :P
2016-04-07 08:09:21	nc	yeah i tried it on linux once
2016-04-07 08:09:27	nc	it didn't work well with that
2016-04-07 08:09:32	nc	i have an imac i use for stuff like that
2016-04-07 08:09:40	tymscar	Nice <3
2016-04-07 08:10:00	nc	yeah... it gathers a lot of dust tho. i rarely touch it
2016-04-07 08:10:03	nc	only once ever few months
2016-04-07 08:10:45	tymscar	can i have it then ? :P
2016-04-07 08:11:00	nc	lol, it's vital in those rare instances tho
2016-04-07 08:11:14	nc	oh, and with synergy it's actually not a bad experience between linux and osx
2016-04-07 08:11:22	tymscar	whats that?
2016-04-07 08:11:23	nc	(since it shares the copy/paste buffer between the two machines)
2016-04-07 08:11:28	nc	http://synergy-project.org/
2016-04-07 08:11:31	tymscar	aaa
2016-04-07 08:11:33	tymscar	i remeber it
2016-04-07 08:11:37	tymscar	can i sue that with my macbook?
2016-04-07 08:11:42	nc	yep
2016-04-07 08:11:45	tymscar	i mean , what a dumb question

2016-04-07 08:12:00		[08:12]
2016-04-07 08:12:04	nc	and can use them all at the same time
2016-04-07 08:12:15	nc	only issue is networking (and finding the right ip for the server)
2016-04-07 08:12:21	nc	but i'm going to work on that a bit this week
2016-04-07 08:12:34	tymscar	what do you mean?
2016-04-07 08:12:41	tymscar	if their on the same server it shopuld be flawless
2016-04-07 08:12:56	nc	it's fine once it's running
2016-04-07 08:13:09	nc	but before, i have to find the ip for the server, connect from the clients, etc
2016-04-07 08:13:15	tymscar	you knwo waht would be the best thing ever?
2016-04-07 08:13:23	tymscar	a free app on my ipad to use it as a third screen
2016-04-07 08:13:59	nc	uh... i know of one but it's not free
2016-04-07 08:14:05	nc	it's like $b
2016-04-07 08:14:11	nc	s/b/3/me
2016-04-07 08:14:12	regx	<nc> it's like $3
2016-04-07 08:14:14	+fyr	but stallman taught me free is best
2016-04-07 08:14:21	+fyr	/s
2016-04-07 08:14:23	nc	LOL
2016-04-07 08:14:30	tymscar	its not about that
2016-04-07 08:14:36	nc	there's probably a free one for android
2016-04-07 08:14:40	nc	i dunno about ios tho
2016-04-07 08:14:42	tymscar	its about me not having money on my card
2016-04-07 08:15:41	tymscar	erm... synergy is 10 bucks now. 
2016-04-07 08:15:44	tymscar	so ill skip that
2016-04-07 08:15:51	nc	no no you can build it from source
2016-04-07 08:16:01	tymscar	yaourt?
2016-04-07 08:16:13	nc	i think it's even in the regular arch repo
2016-04-07 08:16:17	tymscar	found it on yaourt
2016-04-07 08:16:21	nc	ok
2016-04-07 08:16:28	nc	but you have to build it on osx then: https://github.com/symless/synergy
2016-04-07 08:16:32	tymscar	Q.Q
2016-04-07 08:16:55	tymscar	cant i just brew install synergy?
2016-04-07 08:17:05	nc	if it's in the repo i guess
2016-04-07 08:17:08	nc	i don't know if it's there tho
2016-04-07 08:17:10	humhum	ok after reading through the damn arch wiki, still not working, this is ridiculous.
2016-04-07 08:17:17	nc	humhum: whats borked?
2016-04-07 08:17:34	humhum	fonts are borked -.-
2016-04-07 08:17:41	nc	which ones?
2016-04-07 08:17:52	humhum	boobah, tried to help me but still no success.
2016-04-07 08:18:00	nc	did you try installing them from yoaurt?
2016-04-07 08:18:04	humhum	trying to get the old phallus fonts working
2016-04-07 08:18:14	humhum	running debian nc 
2016-04-07 08:18:17	%kirby	humhum: I struggle with them so much
2016-04-07 08:18:31	humhum	just used arch wiki because its good for info

2016-04-07 08:18:36	%kirby	Lemon is always weird it works in urxvt but not dwm or xfontsel
2016-04-07 08:18:41	nc	i don't know/use debian
2016-04-07 08:18:54	%kirby	Where it just shows up as a lot of '4's
2016-04-07 08:19:00	nc	kirby: yeah, i've had issues with that
2016-04-07 08:19:01	tymscar	lets see if im pro enoguht to build it from source on my macbook
2016-04-07 08:19:08	nc	i think it's because one uses xft and the other doesn't
2016-04-07 08:19:13	humhum	kirby, i installed fontawesome, san francisco fonts and tiwi fonts
2016-04-07 08:19:17	nc	tymscar: peice of cake

2016-04-07 08:22:13	humhum	i ll just keep digging through this crap till i trow the macbook out of the window...
2016-04-07 08:22:27	%kirby	Ooh tewi looks quite nice
2016-04-07 08:22:52	%kirby	That'd make me just like nc lol, except Debian instead of Arch :P
2016-04-07 08:23:14	nc	kirby: lol
2016-04-07 08:23:25	nc	tewi has pretty good support for strange characters too
2016-04-07 08:23:33	nc	i think it has a braille alphabet and everything
2016-04-07 08:23:41	nc	(and i don't think lemon supports that much)
2016-04-07 08:24:01	%kirby	Nah it doesn't
2016-04-07 08:24:52	nc	speaking of...
2016-04-07 08:24:57	tymscar	this compiling is shit on my mac

2016-04-07 08:25:03	nc	TIME TO RICE DWM AGAIN CAUSE IM BORED OF THIS COLOR SCHEME
2016-04-07 08:25:13	nc	tymscar: blame cmake
2016-04-07 08:25:28	nc	when i did it i had to go and fix some of the flags manually in the script used to build it
2016-04-07 08:25:29	tymscar	it tells me to pass --mac-identity and --mac-sdk and shit
2016-04-07 08:25:33	nc	yeah
2016-04-07 08:25:38	nc	there's something borked in the python script)
2016-04-07 08:25:43	tymscar	so what cna i do?
2016-04-07 08:26:04	nc	fix the script (try commenting out the lines or something)
2016-04-07 08:26:06	nc	or... hang on
2016-04-07 08:26:22	nc	i could send you my built binaries
2016-04-07 08:26:51	tymscar	ok
2016-04-07 08:27:07	nc	it'll take me a few minutes tho

2016-04-07 08:30:50	humhum	fml...
2016-04-07 08:30:51	nc	tymscar: this might help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26923227/how-to-compile-synergy-on-mac
2016-04-07 08:31:04	nc	and they link to the nightly builds if you want experimental stuff; https://synergy-project.org/nightly
2016-04-07 08:31:23	@rocx	blast! i hate not getting off of mentor hold for class-registering!
2016-04-07 08:31:36	@rocx	rather, i hate missing the chance to register for a class because i was sitll on hold at the time.
2016-04-07 08:31:45	tymscar	ok. ill try this now nc
2016-04-07 08:31:46	nc	oh dang that sucks
2016-04-07 08:32:00	nc	i've taken classes at the local community college for the last two years
2016-04-07 08:32:14	@rocx	dang. that would've been monday, wednesday, and friday every week from 0930 to 1045.
2016-04-07 08:32:22	nc	and i need an advisor to sign off on everything before i can sign up (and we can start signing up like two weeks later than everyone else)
2016-04-07 08:32:28	nc	all 'cause i'm in highschool :(
2016-04-07 08:32:31	@rocx	yikes.
2016-04-07 08:33:21	@rocx	i'm more surprised about mentor holds here.
2016-04-07 08:33:33	@rocx	because when i went for my associates degree, we didn't have those.
2016-04-07 08:35:17	@rocx	cripes a lot of mon-wed-fri classes here.
2016-04-07 08:35:19	tymscar	i think the compilation works
2016-04-07 08:35:30	tymscar	i dont have yosemite but i adapted the command to elcapitan
2016-04-07 08:35:31	tymscar	:D
2016-04-07 08:37:23	nc	tymscar: ah cool
2016-04-07 08:37:26	nc	figuring things out :D
2016-04-07 08:37:35	tymscar	im getting pro, i tell ya

2016-04-07 08:40:10	sshbio	kirby: You go fast! Have notifications somehow?
2016-04-07 08:40:22	%kirby	No I just happened to be going through the forum.

2016-04-07 08:41:53	@rocx	video.
2016-04-07 08:42:01	@rocx	as in WHOA THERE'S SOMETHING THAT ISN'T JUST TEXT ON THE TTY
2016-04-07 08:42:11	tymscar	done. Compilation worked nc
2016-04-07 08:42:11		[08:42]
2016-04-07 08:42:13	sshbio	rocx: Yes, quite much!
2016-04-07 08:42:17	tymscar	now lets see the server part
2016-04-07 08:43:04	humhum	if this somehow works i am going to kick the shit out of this laptop...
2016-04-07 08:43:08	sshbio	kirby: Thank you, by the way!
2016-04-07 08:43:51	sshbio	humhum: I never understand why the font configuration needs to be so complicated!
2016-04-07 08:44:27	nc	wow dude looking good
2016-04-07 08:44:31	nc	(sshbio)
2016-04-07 08:44:54	tymscar	nc, do you need anything else than starting the server on the pc and entering the ip on the macbook? cause it keeps refusing the client with the name " oscars-macbook"
2016-04-07 08:45:02	+fyr	sshbio, sick
2016-04-07 08:45:24	+fyr	sshbio you must post how you did everything
2016-04-07 08:45:34	sshbio	nc, fyr: Thank you! :)  I basically just used 2 (mplayer and tmux)
2016-04-07 08:45:56	+fyr	never seen mplayer play directly into a term
2016-04-07 08:46:02	humhum	neither do i, seriously i hate dealing with fonts...
2016-04-07 08:46:29	+fyr	also I haven't had much luck with bdf2psf
2016-04-07 08:47:37	sshbio	fyr: Neither did I.  Multiple issues to convert.  But this perl script, nothing I know is able to make psf font these day.
2016-04-07 08:49:46	sshbio	fyr: There is the mplayer command I used at nixers.net: https://nixers.net/showthread.php?tid=1669&page=5
2016-04-07 08:49:52	+fyr	yh I saw
2016-04-07 08:49:59	+fyr	you just resized it
2016-04-07 08:50:08	+fyr	I thought it was playing directly in the term there
2016-04-07 08:50:09		humhum (humhum@Clk-7B96436D.rev.vodafone.pt) has quit (Read error)
2016-04-07 08:50:12	+fyr	still impressive though
2016-04-07 08:50:58	sshbio	I'll post details here.  Yes, basically.  And the trick is that I played it in one tty and then switched to another.  The video is drawn ontop of an empty tmux pane.

2016-04-07 08:51:54	humhum	well i need to smack something right now...
2016-04-07 08:52:32	humhum	so out of sport i just installed the artwiz (or whatever the name is) fonts
2016-04-07 08:53:29	humhum	guess what they work, so i install tiwi they work, i install artwiz they work, i install san francisco fonts they work and fontawesome, they work...
2016-04-07 08:53:36	humhum	phallus fonts don't...
2016-04-07 08:53:45	tymscar	nc. synergy works flawlessly
2016-04-07 08:53:46	tymscar	!
2016-04-07 08:53:56	humhum	this is what is happening in my pc right now...
2016-04-07 08:55:40	sshbio	humhum: Seems like malediction somehow?
2016-04-07 08:56:09	humhum	xD don't make fun of me xD this is driving me nuts...
2016-04-07 08:57:03	tymscar	synergy has 0 lag input, im impressed
2016-04-07 08:57:10	sshbio	humhum: If you used packages for debian, there may be a script in these that installs the font. Maybe by looking at it, we could make it working?
2016-04-07 08:57:37	sshbio	humhum: Did you installed them with a package?
2016-04-07 08:57:37		[08:57]
2016-04-07 08:57:43	humhum	nah using github, and yes there is a small script
2016-04-07 08:57:50	humhum	does what it should do
2016-04-07 08:58:00	humhum	the fonts are still not there
2016-04-07 08:58:00	sshbio	humhum: That, is really strange!
2016-04-07 08:58:53	sshbio	humhum: Maybe there is a wrong definition in a fonts.dir that shadow the correct one.
2016-04-07 08:59:26	sshbio	humhum: Oh, no, wait you said that it does not get listed in lxappearance...
2016-04-07 08:59:44	sshbio	humhum: How did you installed the others?
2016-04-07 08:59:45	humhum	another weird question everyone is there any reason for every pcf.gz font i have to work (tiwi and artwiz) and the phallus fonts which are only pcf don't work.
2016-04-07 09:00:03	humhum	the same way sshbio 
2016-04-07 09:00:09	sshbio	ok.
2016-04-07 09:00:20	humhum	the ttf fonts i just moved to .fonts in my home folder
2016-04-07 09:00:52	humhum	the tiwi font is actually installed in /usr/share/fonts/X11/tiwi-font
2016-04-07 09:00:56	humhum	they work
2016-04-07 09:01:21	humhum	the phallus on the other hand installed every single place i can think of, doesn't
2016-04-07 09:01:38	sshbio	humhum: Maybe you could install phallus' font in the root as well?  Maybe you already tried.
2016-04-07 09:02:47	sshbio	I mean in something like /usr/share/fonts/X11/lemon/ ?
2016-04-07 09:04:47	humhum	nah i tried to install phallus firstly by copying it to .fonts
2016-04-07 09:05:20	humhum	then by copying to /usr/share/fonts/X11/phallus-fonts
2016-04-07 09:05:28	humhum	it didn't work -.-
2016-04-07 09:06:06	humhum	the only difference i see between these fonts is that tiwi and artwiz fonts that work
2016-04-07 09:06:14	humhum	are pcf.gz
2016-04-07 09:06:35	humhum	while the phallus is just pcf
2016-04-07 09:07:05	humhum	but i mean the gz is just a compressed font shouldn't be different.
2016-04-07 09:07:49	sshbio	humhum: Hum...  Maybe you could make an archive of it? Debian may look for *.pcf.gz in some regex and can not see *.pcf ones?
2016-04-07 09:08:16	sshbio	humhum: But sure, it should not be different.
2016-04-07 09:10:38	+neeasade	anyone here use st
2016-04-07 09:10:44	sshbio	neeasade: I do
2016-04-07 09:10:57	+neeasade	sshbio: is there a bold font setting? just turning off
2016-04-07 09:11:10	+neeasade	'bold' reveals nothing in config.h - using latest btw
2016-04-07 09:11:18	+neeasade	git pull, messing around with it

2016-04-07 09:37:43	tymscar	its fine. hellish but alright. spent 10+ hours configuring my amd drivers and it still lags in cs go
2016-04-07 09:37:49	fuyuki	yeah lol
2016-04-07 09:38:13	fuyuki	arch is a few days fo hell and then bliss
2016-04-07 09:38:27	fuyuki	the more you install it the easier it becomes
2016-04-07 09:38:42	tymscar	yeah
2016-04-07 09:38:44	fsociety	i always just remove systemd as my first step if I install Arch
2016-04-07 09:38:45	fuyuki	well
2016-04-07 09:38:47	tymscar	isntalled it already 5 times

2016-04-07 09:38:59	fuyuki	tymscar do you know about architect linux

2016-04-07 09:40:00	nc	fsociety: talk about it
2016-04-07 09:40:06	nc	and it's impossible to debug
2016-04-07 09:40:15	nc	journctl is the dumbest thing i've ever seen
2016-04-07 09:40:16	fuyuki	i've heard bad things about it

2016-04-07 09:40:50	nc	i don't see why it's become so popular
2016-04-07 09:40:51	fuyuki	so like windows

2016-04-07 09:41:08	fsociety	actually come to think of it, it does remind me of windows event manager. haha
2016-04-07 09:41:10	@rocx	systemd feels like it adds a whole new bureaucratic layer.
2016-04-07 09:41:10	nc	oh and pusleaudio too
2016-04-07 09:41:23	nc	rocx: well, that's what it is - a political move
2016-04-07 09:41:36	nc	pretty much anything pottering touches is junk
2016-04-07 09:41:46	@rocx	the whole freedesktop.org project is crock.
2016-04-07 09:41:51	nc	^^
2016-04-07 09:41:53	@rocx	it reeks of exactly that. bureaucracy

2016-04-07 09:42:20	nc	and canonical 
2016-04-07 09:42:30	nc	rocx: i know!
2016-04-07 09:42:40	nc	it has a decent "modern" gui on top
2016-04-07 09:42:46	nc	but glib is junk
2016-04-07 09:42:47	fsociety	well canonical took ages to integrate systemd but they did do the pulseaudio thing
2016-04-07 09:42:48	@rocx	canonical would probably make ubuntu its own unique operating system if it proved profitable to them.
2016-04-07 09:42:57	nc	like, did you seriously have to wrap the whole of the c stdlib?
2016-04-07 09:43:00	@rocx	rather than just a gnu/linux distribution.
2016-04-07 09:43:07	fsociety	well canonical just provided microsoft and windows 10 a bash shell out of the box
2016-04-07 09:43:11	nc	^^^
2016-04-07 09:43:13	nc	SUCH EVIL
2016-04-07 09:43:18	@rocx	what makes this different from cygwin?
2016-04-07 09:43:20	nc	or just plain stupidity 
2016-04-07 09:43:22	@rocx	being "more official"?
2016-04-07 09:43:29	fsociety	its more native than cygwin
2016-04-07 09:43:30	nc	rocx: there's a frickin' ELF emulation layer

2016-04-07 09:44:31	fsociety	The only thing I use my Win partition for is gaming and thats it, other than it just sits there collecting dust
2016-04-07 09:44:45	@rocx	my windows partition hasn't been touched since 2013.
2016-04-07 09:44:50	@rocx	maybe even earlier.
2016-04-07 09:44:57	nc	i use wine (since the windows games i play are a few years old)
2016-04-07 09:45:07	nc	and i have an imac for anything that supports osx
2016-04-07 09:45:13	@rocx	doesn't WINE also play some older games decent too?

2016-04-07 09:45:30	nc	hey vypr 
2016-04-07 09:45:34	@rocx	the seventh one?
2016-04-07 09:45:40	fsociety	i used to be like. unfortunately the performance different between win and linux benchmark wise in games is huge. mostly to blame through lazy opengl ports *coughs* unity... now i wait for vulkan to mature and boom no more windows
2016-04-07 09:45:41	@rocx	been playing that on my raspberry pi.
2016-04-07 09:45:50	nc	rocx: nah, 3rd right now
2016-04-07 09:45:56	@rocx	ah that one.
2016-04-07 09:45:58	nc	fsociety: that's true
2016-04-07 09:46:12	@rocx	also, these games need a real port: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack:_The_Puzzle_Collection

2016-04-07 09:46:21	fsociety	haha
2016-04-07 09:46:33	nc	lol
2016-04-07 09:46:35	@rocx	nc: 1 and 5 are my favorite ones.
2016-04-07 09:46:50	fsociety	The Microsoft "Entertainment" Pack
2016-04-07 09:46:51	nc	really?
2016-04-07 09:46:53	@rocx	1 because it was really old school. it may well have been a D&D remake.
2016-04-07 09:46:53	fsociety	that sentence scares me
2016-04-07 09:46:55	nc	i'll have to find the first one somewhere then
2016-04-07 09:47:05	nc	fsociety: LOL
2016-04-07 09:47:07	@rocx	fsociety: it's the ye olde microsofte.
2016-04-07 09:47:19	@rocx	it was on our grandparents' box.
2016-04-07 09:47:19	fsociety	dos 5 microsoft?
2016-04-07 09:47:41	@rocx	fsociety: basically it contained some cool puzzle games like fringer, finty flush, rat poker, et al.
2016-04-07 09:47:48	@rocx	windows 93.
2016-04-07 09:47:48	fsociety	ahh
2016-04-07 09:47:55	nc	that scares me
2016-04-07 09:47:58	@rocx	no wait it looks like it was made more for 95.
2016-04-07 09:48:07	nc	windows xp was windows at it's best (and even then it was terrible)
2016-04-07 09:48:13	fsociety	windows 93? that would equal windows for workgroups 3.11 
2016-04-07 09:48:13	fsociety	haha
2016-04-07 09:48:18	@rocx	its main gimmick is that some of them (or one of them) was designed by the same guy who designed tetris.
2016-04-07 09:48:33	nc	but we have bsdtetris
2016-04-07 09:48:33	@rocx	fsociety: yeah i got lost on my ye olde windows versions.
2016-04-07 09:48:35	nc	and it works without a wm
2016-04-07 09:48:40	nc	BOOM IN YOUR FACE MICROSOFT
2016-04-07 09:48:44	fsociety	haha
2016-04-07 09:49:08	@rocx	these games need a modern port.
2016-04-07 09:49:24	@rocx	or at least free versions like you'd see on a typical linux box.
2016-04-07 09:49:31	nc	but... why?
2016-04-07 09:49:51	@rocx	nc: because nostalgia and these games are genuinely fun.
2016-04-07 09:49:51	fsociety	actual there a few windows 3.1 games i'd like to see ported
2016-04-07 09:49:56	fsociety	mostly adventure games

2016-04-07 11:00:09	fsociety	night
2016-04-07 11:00:25	fsociety	time to hunt for another impossible for 3440x1440 wallpaper
2016-04-07 11:00:26	fsociety	urgh
2016-04-07 11:00:36	fsociety	impossible wallpaper*
2016-04-07 11:00:44	+fyr	heh
2016-04-07 11:00:55	+fyr	hey fsociety do you have extra monitors?
2016-04-07 11:01:06	+fyr	I need someone to test out fyre mulithead
2016-04-07 11:01:25	fsociety	i do
2016-04-07 11:01:42	+fyr	okay well if you got any free time
2016-04-07 11:02:50	fsociety	i can try it out tonight
2016-04-07 11:02:52	fsociety	what do you need me to run
2016-04-07 11:04:09	+fyr	see how the functions generateScreenInfo, findCurrentScreen and retrieveScreenValues give you decent results
2016-04-07 11:04:16	+fyr	( use xrandr to position the screens)
2016-04-07 11:04:26	fsociety	all on your git i imagine
2016-04-07 11:04:34	+fyr	then you can try using position --screen {1,2,3}

2016-04-07 11:04:59	+fyr	all the position cases will accept a screen num
2016-04-07 11:05:04	fsociety	alright i'll try this when i get home from work tonight

2016-04-07 11:05:23	+fyr	sweel
2016-04-07 11:05:26	+fyr	swell*
2016-04-07 11:06:03	+fyr	snap and fullscreen will also take a screen arg
2016-04-07 11:06:07	+fyr	if you get that far
2016-04-07 11:07:20	fsociety	im guessing i'll need to install the wmutils packages for this
2016-04-07 11:07:20		[11:07]
2016-04-07 11:07:29	+fyr	ya and xorg-xprop
2016-04-07 11:07:41	+fyr	do make link
2016-04-07 11:07:44	fsociety	xprop is already installed because bspwm has the same dependency
2016-04-07 11:07:47	+fyr	and make config if you're lazy
2016-04-07 11:08:01	fsociety	haha okay
2016-04-07 11:08:17	+fyr	then just exec runfyre
2016-04-07 11:08:22	+fyr	(with sxhkd)
2016-04-07 11:08:33	fsociety	ahh its been a while since i've used your scripts - this will be fun
2016-04-07 11:08:38	+fyr	hahah
2016-04-07 11:08:44	+fyr	maybe you'll enjoy it :P
2016-04-07 11:08:48	fsociety	most probably
2016-04-07 11:09:36	feute	fyr: why don't you just get a contributor to push improvements for multihead
2016-04-07 11:09:44	+fyr	feute, are you offering?
2016-04-07 11:09:46	+fyr	:p
2016-04-07 11:10:11	+fyr	also I'm the only one using fyre fulltime I think :(
2016-04-07 11:10:12	feute	nah, i don't like wmutils as a 'wm'
2016-04-07 11:10:16	feute	aw
2016-04-07 11:10:24	+fyr	would be willing to accept pull requests though
2016-04-07 11:11:07	fsociety	i think where wmutils really excels is the ability for someone to create their own unique window manager that suits them. i look at wmutils as just a set of utilities - the well written scripts is where it is at :)
2016-04-07 11:11:40	feute	yeah, me too, they're nice tools to play with and gather some info
2016-04-07 11:12:36	fsociety	but if im correct bspwm's footprint is virtually the same as wmutils
2016-04-07 11:13:06	+fyr	how so?
2016-04-07 11:13:14	+fyr	surely bspwm has a memory footprint
2016-04-07 11:13:19	fsociety	minimal
2016-04-07 11:13:22	+fyr	wmutils doesn't :p
2016-04-07 11:13:24	+fyr	at all
2016-04-07 11:13:32	+fyr	all runtime baby!
2016-04-07 11:13:42	+neeasade	bspwm a bae
2016-04-07 11:13:48	fsociety	i look at the memory footprint side by side, and it was negligable - a few k
2016-04-07 11:13:56	fsociety	or a mb here or there
2016-04-07 11:14:03	fsociety	it was a while since i looked at it actually
2016-04-07 11:14:28	fsociety	but i'm going to shake my fist at *baskerville* for constantly making my old configs broken
2016-04-07 11:14:38	+fyr	how were you testing a specific program memory?
2016-04-07 11:14:42	+fyr	never done that before actually
2016-04-07 11:15:48	fsociety	i just do the exact same things on both - for eg.. i have 3 blank terminals loaded on both... i also let it set there and idle to see if bspwm has any memory leaks
2016-04-07 11:16:12	fsociety	pretty primitive stuff
2016-04-07 11:16:16	+fyr	perhaps
2016-04-07 11:16:18	fsociety	probably a much better way
2016-04-07 11:16:21	+fyr	ye
2016-04-07 11:16:30	fsociety	but it was just a quick glance and see
2016-04-07 11:16:48	fsociety	you make wildefyr tile amazing, i'll switch back in two seconds :P
2016-04-07 11:16:53	+fyr	I can assure you though that after a script has executed there's no usage in memory at all
2016-04-07 11:16:58	+fyr	ahaha
2016-04-07 11:17:10	+fyr	feel free to contribute a bsp tiling script ^^
2016-04-07 11:17:22	fsociety	aww.. time to learn C
2016-04-07 11:17:41	+fyr	sucks
2016-04-07 11:17:53	fsociety	i think i spent way too much time being ocd over wmutils tiling, making sure that everything was geometrically even
2016-04-07 11:18:15	fsociety	ahh the left gap is -3 pixels compared to the right
2016-04-07 11:18:16	fsociety	haha
2016-04-07 11:18:29	+fyr	yeah me too :(
2016-04-07 11:18:33	+fyr	fucking pain though
2016-04-07 11:18:54	fsociety	yeah, i remember altering your tiling script at one point - cause it didn't render out properly my monitor
2016-04-07 11:19:06	+fyr	that tiling script sucked though
2016-04-07 11:19:24	fsociety	i'm yet to see an amaze-balls tiling script for wmutils
2016-04-07 11:19:40	fsociety	brb.. need drink
2016-04-07 11:19:41	feute	i could contribute with the tiling fyr
2016-04-07 11:20:01	tymscar	newb question: can you use wmutils with i3-wm?
2016-04-07 11:20:03	+fyr	feel free
2016-04-07 11:20:04	feute	i once helped arc with a tiling script, i'm not sure if he's still got it
2016-04-07 11:20:26	feute	tymscar: wmutils is just a set of tools, not a wm, so yes
2016-04-07 11:20:28	+fyr	tymscar, not really, wmutils isn't EWMH compliant
2016-04-07 11:20:40	+fyr	technically you can try
2016-04-07 11:20:48	+fyr	but there will be glitches and stuff
2016-04-07 11:20:56	+fyr	also i3 grabs all hotkeys
2016-04-07 11:21:07	+fyr	so not sure how'd you actually bind anything
2016-04-07 11:21:19	+fyr	unless through i3 config itself (ew)
2016-04-07 11:21:31	tymscar	hm
2016-04-07 11:21:32	tymscar	cool
2016-04-07 11:21:37	tymscar	thanks for the info
2016-04-07 11:21:46	tymscar	ive seen some nice photos of wmutils and thats why i asked
2016-04-07 11:21:53	tymscar	too complicated for me for nwo., need to learn mor
2016-04-07 11:21:55	tymscar	more*
2016-04-07 11:22:31	feute	wmutils is basically coreutils for X
2016-04-07 11:22:31		[11:22]
2016-04-07 11:22:49	tymscar	alright
2016-04-07 11:22:58	+fyr	tymscar, feel free to try out fyre ^^
2016-04-07 11:23:23	+fyr	it should be pretty easy to install and run at this point
2016-04-07 11:24:05	tymscar	what is fyre?
2016-04-07 11:24:15	+fyr	my awesome wmutils based wm

2016-04-07 11:42:48	arc	lemonbar and lotsa fuckery
2016-04-07 11:42:53	boobah	oh god
2016-04-07 11:42:54	feute	hm
2016-04-07 11:43:00	+fyr	it's possible
2016-04-07 11:43:05	arc	but WHY
2016-04-07 11:43:06	boobah	might as well just run openbox or something along with wmutils
2016-04-07 11:43:12	+fyr	you just need to move the lemonbar WITH the window
2016-04-07 11:43:22	arc	boobah: you can't use openbox with wmutils
2016-04-07 11:43:26	+fyr	but lemonbar refuses to be easily scriptable
2016-04-07 11:43:37	boobah	arc: well then one of the wms that gets along with it
2016-04-07 11:43:51	arc	maybe katriawm
2016-04-07 11:43:58	boobah	maybe
2016-04-07 11:43:58	+fyr	nah I lie, it does allow you to set a window name
2016-04-07 11:44:03	+fyr	you could use that
2016-04-07 11:44:16	arc	yes
2016-04-07 11:44:28	arc	would be one hell of a feat though
2016-04-07 11:44:32	boobah	arc: is it due to the reparenting feature that wmutils doesn't work with obox?
2016-04-07 11:44:39	arc	boobah: yes
2016-04-07 11:44:41	+fyr	I'll add it to the fyre roadmap
2016-04-07 11:44:52	arc	also openbox is the worst wm i have ever used
2016-04-07 11:45:03	arc	i would prefer fucking gnome to it
2016-04-07 11:45:09	boobah	i wouldn't go that far

2016-04-07 11:45:16	arc	yes

2016-04-07 12:24:11	+neeasade	https://github.com/neeasade/shit
2016-04-07 12:24:28	+neeasade	it works here(arch) but adam said no go on openbsd
2016-04-07 12:24:29	boobah	omg i was JUST thinking about this, what the hell
2016-04-07 12:24:36	boobah	like seriously
2016-04-07 12:24:40	+fyr	sure
2016-04-07 12:24:49	+fyr	what does it do
2016-04-07 12:24:53	+fyr	rather
2016-04-07 12:24:55	+fyr	what patches
2016-04-07 12:25:07	boobah	neeasade: just want me to see if it works?
2016-04-07 12:25:20	boobah	neeasade: i've got void on my laptop here
2016-04-07 12:25:37	+neeasade	boobah: yes -- load the example in doc/Xresources and then change a value, and then run killall -s USR1 st to see if your changes apply
2016-04-07 12:25:39	+neeasade	fyr: https://github.com/neeasade/shit/blob/master/doc/TODO#L3
2016-04-07 12:25:52	 *	boobah windows -> linux
2016-04-07 12:27:24	+fyr	where are the options for this thing
2016-04-07 12:27:35	+fyr	ah config.h
2016-04-07 12:27:49	+neeasade	fyr: well, https://github.com/neeasade/shit/blob/master/doc/Xresources
2016-04-07 12:28:04	+fyr	oh
2016-04-07 12:28:29	+neeasade	that's the point of this -- is a) loads from xresources and b) you can change xresources and tell term to reload with a signal
2016-04-07 12:28:52	+fyr	so it's sourcing .Xresources?
2016-04-07 12:29:05	@fro	isn't there already one that does that
2016-04-07 12:29:12	boobah	i will seriously love you if this works neeasade 
2016-04-07 12:29:13	boobah	testing now
2016-04-07 12:29:14	+neeasade	fro: yes, but not one that does b) above
2016-04-07 12:29:45	+fyr	I'm so confused, is it using the Xresources in the git dir?
2016-04-07 12:30:06	+neeasade	fyr: that's an example one -- xresources files can be loaded from anywhere with xrdb
2016-04-07 12:30:26	+fyr	right
2016-04-07 12:30:38	boobah	what's with the fonts
2016-04-07 12:31:00	boobah	oh duh it's probably checking xresources
2016-04-07 12:31:02	boobah	i'm a dummy
2016-04-07 12:31:12	+fyr	neeasade, welp
2016-04-07 12:31:16	+fyr	I got bugs to report then
2016-04-07 12:31:32	+fyr	well one bug
2016-04-07 12:31:43	+fyr	it's not setting my background colour
2016-04-07 12:32:03	+neeasade	fyr: ah, I had it pick color0 for background color/no separate setting
2016-04-07 12:32:10	+fyr	ripppp
2016-04-07 12:32:16	+fyr	that's dumb
2016-04-07 12:32:27	+neeasade	that's shit
2016-04-07 12:32:37	boobah	yeah
2016-04-07 12:32:45	+neeasade	boobah: did you check pm to confirm
2016-04-07 12:32:51	+fyr	hence the name? :)
2016-04-07 12:33:40	+neeasade	fyr: yes?
2016-04-07 12:34:25	+fyr	is there a URL grabber?
2016-04-07 12:34:25		[12:34]
2016-04-07 12:34:37	boobah	neeasade: just tried with foreground, doesn't seem to be doing anything
2016-04-07 12:34:40	+neeasade	yes, via external pipe to dmenu fyr 
2016-04-07 12:34:49	+fyr	eh
2016-04-07 12:34:58	+fyr	explain how the hell to use that
2016-04-07 12:35:18	boobah	you hit some keybind
2016-04-07 12:35:31	boobah	and then it filters for urls and pipes to dmenu, i'm guessing
2016-04-07 12:35:35	boobah	that's how one of those patches works
2016-04-07 12:35:36	+neeasade	you add a line to config.h assigning func to a keybind, dmenu with all visible urls in term pops up and filt-- yeah
2016-04-07 12:35:54	+fyr	got an example?
2016-04-07 12:35:56	+fyr	script
2016-04-07 12:36:35	+neeasade	the 'urls..' here - 
2016-04-07 12:36:38	+neeasade	http://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe
2016-04-07 12:36:43	+neeasade	boobah: hm
2016-04-07 12:37:00	boobah	i hope i'm doing this correctly
2016-04-07 12:37:06	boobah	because i get no response
2016-04-07 12:37:08	+neeasade	maybe I should have kept foreground and background toggleable
2016-04-07 12:37:23	+neeasade	made fg --> 'st.color7' value
2016-04-07 12:37:55	boobah	no no this is a great idea
2016-04-07 12:37:58	boobah	what can i try?
2016-04-07 12:38:14	+neeasade	so you did `xrdb doc/Xresources` and launched a term right?
2016-04-07 12:38:21	+fyr	hmm st.termname doesn't seem to have an effect on me
2016-04-07 12:38:21	boobah	in fact i think your comment about toggleable schemes the other day (was that you?) got me thinking about this in the first place
2016-04-07 12:38:27	boobah	neeasade: yes
2016-04-07 12:38:40	+fyr	unless it's setting the window name?
2016-04-07 12:38:59	boobah	and i checked `xrdb -q` too, of course
2016-04-07 12:39:09	+neeasade	boobah: okay, change like st.color0 to #000000 for example, and then `xrdb doc/Xresources` again
2016-04-07 12:39:16	boobah	and then send usr1
2016-04-07 12:39:17	+neeasade	then `killall -s USR1 st`
2016-04-07 12:39:20	+neeasade	yepp
2016-04-07 12:39:24	+neeasade	and no go?
2016-04-07 12:39:32	boobah	well wait
2016-04-07 12:39:46	+fyr	really it should use background though
2016-04-07 12:39:52	boobah	oh shit
2016-04-07 12:39:54	boobah	that worked
2016-04-07 12:40:09	boobah	so i guess only some properties actually work :P
2016-04-07 12:40:23	+neeasade	all the ones in the example file
2016-04-07 12:40:26	boobah	why the hell is color0 the background color?
2016-04-07 12:40:49	+neeasade	because typically they're the same and I wasn't thinking about it -- I'll make them their own properties in a bit 
2016-04-07 12:40:52	+neeasade	so it's more clear
2016-04-07 12:40:57	+fyr	okay cool
2016-04-07 12:40:59	boobah	yes, that would be the proper way to do it
2016-04-07 12:41:10	+fyr	is 'shit' actually gonna be the name for this project
2016-04-07 12:41:11	+fyr	:D
2016-04-07 12:41:25	+neeasade	fyr: I don't reload shell stuff like termname, only reload window type stuff
2016-04-07 12:41:28	+neeasade	and yes
2016-04-07 12:41:31	boobah	"simple hot-change interface terminal"
2016-04-07 12:41:38	+neeasade	XD
2016-04-07 12:41:41	+fyr	neeasade, oh :(
2016-04-07 12:41:45	+neeasade	boobah: thanks for confirming it works btw
2016-04-07 12:41:50	+neeasade	appreciate it
2016-04-07 12:41:55	boobah	dude
2016-04-07 12:41:58	boobah	glad to help at all
2016-04-07 12:41:59	+fyr	echo termname so I can use it with xprop
2016-04-07 12:42:15	+neeasade	fyr: are you thinking window class name?
2016-04-07 12:42:16	boobah	was this hard to implement? i may try doing this mod just for shits.
2016-04-07 12:42:25	+fyr	neeasade, is that implemented ?
2016-04-07 12:42:30	+neeasade	boobah: did it in this evening started today

2016-04-07 13:16:19	boobah	yes obviously i'm looking at it
2016-04-07 13:16:32	boobah	can you explain what you're doing
2016-04-07 13:16:47	boobah	because i just see a bunch of terminals, and one of them is uushi or something like it
2016-04-07 13:16:51	boobah	the rest are lemon
2016-04-07 13:17:00	boobah	what are you changing, when, and to what terminals?
2016-04-07 13:17:20	boobah	neither neeasade nor i are mindreaders

2016-04-07 13:17:27	+fyr	come on
2016-04-07 13:17:38	+fyr	and it loads the font font
2016-04-07 13:17:51	+fyr	wrong*
2016-04-07 13:18:04	+neeasade	it only looks for st.font
2016-04-07 13:18:12	boobah	^^
2016-04-07 13:18:17	+neeasade	suppose that should be an improvement
2016-04-07 13:18:17	+fyr	time to update!
2016-04-07 13:18:56	+fyr	oh btw venam I made an ascii art
2016-04-07 13:19:56	boobah	i'm curious what made you so snippy there fyr
2016-04-07 13:20:05	boobah	that was the first time you posted the Xresources file you're using
2016-04-07 13:20:21	+fyr	because one can clearly see one terminal is not like the other
2016-04-07 13:20:26	boobah	yes
2016-04-07 13:20:28	boobah	but also
2016-04-07 13:20:30	boobah	CLEARLY
2016-04-07 13:20:37	boobah	they are not all the modified st
2016-04-07 13:20:48	 *	fyr pats boobah on the head
2016-04-07 13:20:49	boobah	presumably, it's the two in the top-left
2016-04-07 13:21:04	 *	fyr puts boobah on the naughty step
2016-04-07 13:21:42	boobah	but it looked kind of intentional tbh
2016-04-07 13:21:47	+fyr	I did that because I wanted to show the differences between the fonts
2016-04-07 13:21:51	boobah	so next time explain what you're doing
2016-04-07 13:22:11	+fyr	04:09     +fyr | okay it doesn't seem to be choosing my font :/
2016-04-07 13:22:30	boobah	that's not sufficient
2016-04-07 13:22:42	+fyr	put 2 and 2 together
2016-04-07 13:22:46	boobah	you didn't post the Xresources, or at least the line in question
2016-04-07 13:22:59	boobah	that would have been fine, but you only posted after condescending me
2016-04-07 13:23:19	+fyr	I don't care enough about this to continue this any further
2016-04-07 13:23:40	+fyr	it's only going to end up in a worse place
2016-04-07 13:24:04	boobah	what i said is not incorrect

2016-04-07 14:47:18	@venam	just that you have to understand legacy code

2016-04-07 15:30:25	sq271	fsociety: also, i'm shopping for a more permanent solution besides an aws free acct..
2016-04-07 15:36:00		[15:30]
2016-04-07 15:37:46	fsociety	when i was in the scene i would find wonderful vps's in the netherlands.. that were great.. i do wish i with DO i could choose my billing cycle though.  And as for OS's - it would just be nice to have some others on there.  But having the major ones on there is good enough - I'm just being pedantic.  Their API is top notch though
2016-04-07 15:39:08	fsociety	i use to use DO a lot - had an owncloud instance (which i primarily used for rss feeds) and one for an email server. but i eventually just put an instance of tinytinyrss on my nas and it is tons better.  Email Server - I just got tired of maintaining it.
2016-04-07 15:40:03	sq271	i have a aws-free acct, they bill me for stupid shit, it's not much, just makes me feel nickel and dimed... i'm trying them out with some bs, but i'm not sold at all. i think the web gui sucks.. made up words and bs.
2016-04-07 15:40:45	fsociety	when i went to linux conf, an au provider being where i am gave me a voucher for $200 - got it off their head tech.  I think I'll end up using them for a while

2016-04-07 15:41:42	fsociety	the only thing i want to do is create a minimalist site using a static page generator and put a git repo on there - ala using the script z3bra uses on his website

2016-04-07 15:58:31	fsociety	i prefer funtoo over gentoo
2016-04-07 15:58:45	fsociety	but i do love the whole system
2016-04-07 15:59:12	sq271	i was an arch user for quite awhile, because i had shit machines and no constant inet.. but it really made me hate bin-based, and sytemd..
2016-04-07 15:59:15	fsociety	flags, etc. i remember when i first started using it and boy did those error messages scare me. got used to it after a while.  only happened once in a while
2016-04-07 15:59:30	fsociety	i use arch currently i just removed systemd and installed openrc
2016-04-07 16:00:24	sq271	fsociety: i saw that earlier today, intriguing, but i'm getting comfortable with crux atm..
2016-04-07 16:00:44	sq271	i've played with openrc, but trying out runit
2016-04-07 16:01:03	fsociety	i like crux - but unfortunately i don't have the time to fix every idiosyncracy.. nothing worse when i work from home and my boss is like quickly do this.. and my response is ahhh.. something broke on my pc
2016-04-07 16:01:04	fsociety	haha
2016-04-07 16:01:43	fsociety	but personally i prefer funtoo over crux. a nice mixture of do it yourself and a very inviting small community with great documentation
2016-04-07 16:01:45	sq271	fsociety: i get that, i haven't fully migrated yet... i still have alot to learn

2016-04-07 16:02:13	fsociety	and its run by the original gentoo creator, i guess it was a fuck you to the gentoo foundation who wouldn't allow him to apply his new little technologies to make gentoo more user friendly
2016-04-07 16:02:36	sq271	i haven't looked into funtoo much, will do

2016-04-07 16:44:36	fsociety	at least AU you know how much the tax is on the product, its incorporated into the price. from what i've read you guys get taxed at purchase. so the actually price is not the real price

2016-04-07 22:16:23	tA	Yeah I could only find options to block access to certain files, not to allow access

2016-04-07 23:23:42	humhum	i just used the bdf fonts

2016-04-07 23:24:42	sshbio	So that is good news!
2016-04-07 23:24:47	humhum	yup
2016-04-07 23:25:02	dcat	what's the problem with pcf?
2016-04-07 23:25:21	humhum	the bad news is that after installing them and having a look at lemon, i prefer tiwi ahahah

2016-04-07 23:26:38	humhum	because they refused to work...
2016-04-07 23:26:46	humhum	although all pcf.gz fonts worked.
2016-04-07 23:26:49	sshbio	dcat: It did not worked, and I often see fonts editable as bdf while pcf versions are said not to be editable.  But I do not really know the technical difference

2016-04-08 01:08:11	sin	it would be nice to have idiomatic solutions for each of these languages (apl version is certainly idiomatic ;))
2016-04-08 01:08:32	@rocx	sin: bc and dc are underrated tools.
2016-04-08 01:08:36	@xero	for me i think it's the "c" example that looks the cleanest and most readable
2016-04-08 01:08:37	sin	totally rocx

2016-04-08 01:43:10	@xero	sorry amiga fans
2016-04-08 01:43:18	+seth	it's not cruft, IFDEF's are compile time logic

2016-04-08 01:58:28	@xero	editing on remote machines is fine
2016-04-08 01:58:42	@xero	but i'd love to sling it back to my local session more
2016-04-08 01:59:09	+fyr	you can edit remote files using a local session of vim
2016-04-08 01:59:18	greduan	fuck it, this weekend is not for Emacs, it's for vis.
2016-04-08 01:59:25	greduan	fyr: scp?
2016-04-08 01:59:36	+fyr	greduan, I think it's done over that protocol yes
2016-04-08 01:59:45	+fyr	I've never done it myself because the syntax is clunky
2016-04-08 01:59:51	+fyr	another option is sshfs
2016-04-08 01:59:52	greduan	I think it aws like :e scp://.......
2016-04-08 02:00:36	@rocx	fyr: TRAMP to the rescue?
2016-04-08 02:00:56	+fyr	TRAMP?
2016-04-08 02:01:04	greduan	It's a trap
2016-04-08 02:01:12	@xero	i dont have linters and stuff installed everywhere. and if i'm making a hot fix on production i'd like to have some code quality validation before i :wq
2016-04-08 02:01:17	@rocx	the ability to edit files remotely.

2016-04-08 02:01:33	dcat	I'm starting to hate it so much
2016-04-08 02:01:35	+fyr	dcat, apparently
2016-04-08 02:01:42	greduan	why?
2016-04-08 02:01:48	dcat	how do I turn off tab inserting spaces?
2016-04-08 02:02:08	greduan	you want tab to insert tabs?
2016-04-08 02:02:12	dcat	yes
2016-04-08 02:02:13	+fyr	:set noet
2016-04-08 02:02:24	greduan	:set noexpandtab
2016-04-08 02:02:37	dcat	no difference
2016-04-08 02:02:41	greduan	man people give me shit for not Googling, such a Googleable question. lol
2016-04-08 02:02:47	+fyr	:set nosmarttab
2016-04-08 02:02:56	dcat	turned off that too
2016-04-08 02:02:59	+fyr	odd
2016-04-08 02:03:01	dcat	and nosmartindent

2016-04-08 02:03:15	greduan	so I don't have to worry about this stuff

2016-04-08 02:04:03	@xero	dcat, using osx, hating vim... what's going on?!?!?
2016-04-08 02:04:35	@xero	also, i thought you used xvi cat
2016-04-08 02:04:36	@xero	or some mini vi clone
2016-04-08 02:04:43	sshbio	dcat: Maybe you have a different tabstop (the size one tab character looks like on the buffer) and shiftwidth (the size you want tab key to insert, regardless tab or spaces).
2016-04-08 02:05:22	sshbio	if tabstop is 8 and shiftwidth 4, while pressing tab, vim will want to insert half a tab
2016-04-08 02:05:22	@rocx	xero: he's more of an nvi guy.
2016-04-08 02:05:28	@rocx	or at least i remembered him as an nvi guy.
2016-04-08 02:06:16	sshbio	But it can't, so it will insert 4 spaces instead, and next tab key press will remove the 4 space and insert a real tab.
2016-04-08 02:06:44	feute	dcat: :set expandtab!
2016-04-08 02:06:46	feute	that works for me
2016-04-08 02:07:41	%stark	replace tabs with white spaces ?
2016-04-08 02:07:57	greduan	make tab insert tabs instead of spaces
2016-04-08 02:08:00	feute	insert tab instead of spaces
2016-04-08 02:08:16	@xero	rocx: oh yeah, that's what i was thinking of.
2016-04-08 02:09:06	%stark	Doesn't :set et replace tabs white appropriate whitespaces ?
2016-04-08 02:09:45	sshbio	stark: It does, but with the bang (!), it toggle that option on or off.
2016-04-08 02:09:45		[02:09]
2016-04-08 02:09:58	@xero	i think he just means in general while editing, when pressing tab do a tab char, not a space equiv
2016-04-08 02:10:01	sshbio	s/gle/gles/
2016-04-08 02:10:01	regx	<sshbio> stark: It does, but with the bang (!), it toggles that option on or off.
2016-04-08 02:10:32	%stark	Ahh
2016-04-08 02:11:54	%stark	well all those times I hated myself because I *accidentally* put "vim: set et:" as a comment in the files then forgot about them
2016-04-08 02:12:15	+fyr	vim mode line suck
2016-04-08 02:12:26	+fyr	or whatever you call that line

2016-04-08 02:13:41	@xero	i dont use them
2016-04-08 02:14:06	tudurom	i use them only in my xres files
2016-04-08 02:14:15	tudurom	because vim doesn't recognize them

2016-04-08 03:30:53	@rocx	fuyuki: it's not hard once you know it.
2016-04-08 03:31:01	@rocx	character classes are the hardest part.
2016-04-08 03:31:06	Lola	you could learn by doing those regex crosswords

2016-04-08 03:31:30	neeawerk	regex is very useful.
2016-04-08 03:31:31	sshbio	But books are better references.
2016-04-08 03:31:49	fuyuki	thanks guys

2016-04-08 04:50:01	dcat	no as in
2016-04-08 04:50:08	dcat	why do you need to use cat?
2016-04-08 04:50:42	boobah	if i just need to make a quick hello-world-style script or C program for a test, using cat(1) is faster than any editor out there

2016-04-08 04:51:13	dcat	no
2016-04-08 04:51:15	dcat	that's wrong
2016-04-08 04:51:27	tudurom	why cat
2016-04-08 04:51:30	tudurom	when you have cp
2016-04-08 04:51:44	tudurom	it's easier to type
2016-04-08 04:51:48	neeawerk	n-no
2016-04-08 04:51:49	boobah	tudurom: why would i be writing a program i already have?

2016-04-08 04:52:41	boobah	let's say i forgot how many bytes wide a "long long" is
2016-04-08 04:52:55	boobah	just type out a quick C file with cat(1) and shell redirection, problem solved
2016-04-08 04:53:07	boobah	xero: rofl
2016-04-08 04:53:25	boobah	xero: although, combined with `-f`, that's actually a useful construct
2016-04-08 04:53:26	@xero	what? tail's designed to print a file (or parts of it)
2016-04-08 04:53:39	boobah	we're not talking about printing files
2016-04-08 04:53:44	boobah	we're talking about writing them
2016-04-08 04:54:18	@xero	right
2016-04-08 04:54:29	@xero	cat is designed for multiple files
2016-04-08 04:54:34	@xero	tail is designed for a sinle file
2016-04-08 04:54:43	boobah	yeah, but it's a useful "filler" for use with shell redirection
2016-04-08 04:54:53	boobah	and it's one fewer char to type than tail
2016-04-08 04:54:57	@xero	you dont need it
2016-04-08 04:55:10	@xero	there are other tools better suted than cat 99% of the time
2016-04-08 04:55:12	boobah	cat is smaller than tail
2016-04-08 04:55:15	@xero	it's a hack that works
2016-04-08 04:55:20	boobah	it's not a hack
2016-04-08 04:55:22	@xero	so? both are already installed
2016-04-08 04:55:29	@xero	using a tool the wrong way is a hack

2016-04-08 04:55:45	regx	<xero> using a tool an unintended way is a hack
2016-04-08 04:56:01	boobah	yes, but you have to specify the options to tail or head
2016-04-08 04:56:05	boobah	with cat, it works without any options
2016-04-08 04:56:08	@xero	so?
2016-04-08 04:56:19	boobah	concatenating 1 file to nothing is still a concatenation to an empty buffer
2016-04-08 04:56:24	boobah	it's not a misuse
2016-04-08 04:57:31	boobah	anyway, it works for me and i can create files quicker than with any other program with it, so who cares?
2016-04-08 04:57:43	boobah	just use what works for you and move on :)
2016-04-08 04:57:51	@xero	if you say so

2016-04-08 05:22:32	boobah	tudurom: that's kind of a waste tbh
2016-04-08 05:22:41	tudurom	i think alsamixer is drunk
2016-04-08 05:22:41	boobah	Shinryuu: why do you say that?
2016-04-08 05:22:56	boobah	tudurom: anything alsa-related is always drunk
2016-04-08 05:23:02	tudurom	amixer says my volume is 32, alsamixer reports 11
2016-04-08 05:23:03	Shinryuu	boobah: unexplored territories for me
2016-04-08 05:23:31	boobah	tudurom: i'm tellin you, i achieved 11 MB on arch with systemd, recently too
2016-04-08 05:23:40	boobah	tudurom: without any tweaks
2016-04-08 05:23:56	tudurom	on a fresh one maybe
2016-04-08 05:25:39	boobah	yeah, it was my irssi server for a few weeks
2016-04-08 05:25:47	boobah	ran pretty much nothing else

2016-04-08 05:30:39	boobah	why? you personally wrote a wm to be used with it.
2016-04-08 05:30:54	dcat	what?
2016-04-08 05:30:57	+fyr	I'd hardly call swm a WM
2016-04-08 05:31:00	+fyr	more of a helper
2016-04-08 05:31:02	@xero	regx | s/fire/fyr/
2016-04-08 05:31:04	boobah	it's a wm all right
2016-04-08 05:31:09	dcat	wmutils is swm
2016-04-08 05:31:13	@xero	nope, still cant do "himself"
2016-04-08 05:31:13	boobah	wat
2016-04-08 05:31:16	dcat	split into pieces
2016-04-08 05:31:21	dcat	that's why I made it
2016-04-08 05:31:56	@xero	which i thought was weird, since i had issues running swm + wmutils
2016-04-08 05:32:06	@xero	double duty i guess
2016-04-08 05:32:29	dcat	what was the problems xero?
2016-04-08 05:32:29		[05:32]
2016-04-08 05:32:38	@xero	i cant remember now.
2016-04-08 05:32:40	boobah	dcat: when you first wrote it, it was filling in for the parts that wmutils couldn't usefully do itself
2016-04-08 05:32:43	@xero	but focus releated stuffs
2016-04-08 05:33:06	dcat	boobah: no
2016-04-08 05:33:16	dcat	when I wrote swm, it was a full wm
2016-04-08 05:33:27	@xero	dcat | s/was/is/
2016-04-08 05:33:27	regx	<dcat> when I wrote swm, it is a full wm
2016-04-08 05:33:28	dcat	then I split it into pieces and named it wmutils with z3bra
2016-04-08 05:34:12	sshbio	Thank you for your work guys :)
2016-04-08 05:34:19	boobah	dcat: you know how wew is in /opt?
2016-04-08 05:34:30	dcat	yes
2016-04-08 05:34:31	boobah	dcat: well without it, you need something like swm to handle your window creation and deletion evenst
2016-04-08 05:34:49	dcat	correct
2016-04-08 05:35:03	@xero	boobah: i dont use wew
2016-04-08 05:35:30	+fyr	xero, eh
2016-04-08 05:35:32	+fyr	EH
2016-04-08 05:35:53	boobah	xero: is there a different way of doing this now?
2016-04-08 05:35:59	@xero	i use a mod of https://github.com/wmutils/contrib/blob/master/focus_watcher.sh
2016-04-08 05:36:03	boobah	xero: i haven't used wmutils in at least a year
2016-04-08 05:36:21	boobah	xero: that literally calls wew
2016-04-08 05:36:42	@xero	huh, my version must be old then
2016-04-08 05:36:51	boobah	how does your thing work?
2016-04-08 05:37:46	dcat	what was your point though boobah 
2016-04-08 05:38:55	boobah	dcat: that swm is a convenient fill-in for the features missing in wmutils/core, whether you intended for it to be or not
2016-04-08 05:39:04	boobah	dcat: what do you use nowadays?
2016-04-08 05:39:18	dcat	aqua
2016-04-08 05:39:25	@xero	wow, so i just looked at the code for wew, and i'm going to use that instead of the crappy crap i'm using now. lel
2016-04-08 05:39:27	boobah	oh right, i forgot you switched to Mac OS X 
2016-04-08 05:39:40	boobah	xero: you didn't mention how yours works
2016-04-08 05:39:52	@xero	it's almost identical logic in shell
2016-04-08 05:40:06	@xero	huge switch case for XCB events
2016-04-08 05:40:26	@xero	and some eventing
2016-04-08 05:40:26	boobah	xero: yes. but where do the XCB events come from?
2016-04-08 05:40:41	boobah	xero: ie. how does the shell get them, without wew?

2016-04-08 05:46:57	boobah	dcat: okay, let's scroll up
2016-04-08 05:47:11	boobah	dcat: you originally expressed your sadness with me missing wmutils
2016-04-08 05:47:28	dcat	it was a joke
2016-04-08 05:47:30	boobah	dcat: i asked why (thinking you had written swm for use with wmutils)
2016-04-08 05:47:30		[05:47]
2016-04-08 05:47:38	dcat	referring to the lyrics of mike oldfield
2016-04-08 05:47:40	boobah	dcat: now i know that was not exactly how things went
2016-04-08 05:48:31	boobah	the only thing i'm missing now is how xero's thing works without wew, because i'm curious about that
2016-04-08 05:49:16	dcat	okay let me rephrase then
2016-04-08 05:49:24	dcat	why do you assume that you need wew or swm in the first place?
2016-04-08 05:49:45	dcat	windows still get created, it's just that you're subscribing to it
2016-04-08 05:50:23	boobah	you need something to handle the focusing model
2016-04-08 05:50:30	boobah	new window -> focus it
2016-04-08 05:50:38	boobah	window is deleted -> focus the next in the stack
2016-04-08 05:50:46	dcat	you don't need it
2016-04-08 05:50:49	boobah	not to mention, the subscription
2016-04-08 05:51:05	boobah	you need it unless you wanna `wtf <wid>` manually
2016-04-08 05:51:09	nc	boobah: as a hack, you could `watch lsw`
2016-04-08 05:51:52	boobah	nc: yeah, that would work
2016-04-08 05:51:56	boobah	nc: hacky as hell :)
2016-04-08 05:52:22	dcat	or you could just select the window you want
2016-04-08 05:52:59	nc	boobah: yeah it's a hack, but it'd work ;)
2016-04-08 05:53:18	boobah	dcat: select, how. piping lsw into dmenu?
2016-04-08 05:53:23	nc	that's what matters at the end of the day
2016-04-08 05:54:59	boobah	from the watch(1) manpage:
2016-04-08 05:55:02	boobah	"The command will not allow quicker than 0.1 second interval, in which the smaller values are converted."
2016-04-08 05:55:05	boobah	damn it!
2016-04-08 05:55:11	dcat	I just bind alt+tab
2016-04-08 05:55:17	dcat	and switch windows with that
2016-04-08 05:55:31	boobah	works okay, but it's slow when you have > 4 windows onscreen
2016-04-08 05:55:40	nc	boobah: just use a while loop
2016-04-08 05:55:43	boobah	2bwm style :)
2016-04-08 05:56:04	boobah	nc: yeah
2016-04-08 05:56:14	nc	while true; do lsw; sleep 0.01; done
2016-04-08 05:56:24	boobah	nc: let's use cpu cycles figuring out if there are any new windows :P
2016-04-08 05:56:49	nc	meh... that's a negligible amount on modern hardware
2016-04-08 05:57:00	boobah	anyway, this whole discussion made me remember why i left the wmutils crowd
2016-04-08 05:57:01	boobah	so yeah
2016-04-08 05:57:05	nc	why not use wew tho?
2016-04-08 05:57:09	boobah	thanks for the ideas though
2016-04-08 05:57:24	boobah	nc: it never worked properly for me on any of my systems
2016-04-08 05:57:34	boobah	nc: talked to z3bra, we could never figure it out
2016-04-08 05:57:39	nc	boobah: could fork and fix it?
2016-04-08 05:57:48	boobah	no interest, really
2016-04-08 05:57:49	nc	x polling is essentially a while loop tho
2016-04-08 05:57:55	boobah	i'd rather write a real wm
2016-04-08 05:58:02	boobah	"real" meaning one-piece
2016-04-08 05:58:04	nc	ok
2016-04-08 05:58:11	boobah	not meaning to dis wmutils
2016-04-08 05:58:14	boobah	if it works for you that's great
2016-04-08 05:58:21	boobah	it just wasn't my cup of tea
2016-04-08 05:58:23	nc	i was using cwm + wmutils for a while
2016-04-08 05:58:32	nc	but switched to dwm 'cause it does more of that stuff for me
2016-04-08 05:58:33	dcat	if anything, you're dissing yourself boobah 
2016-04-08 05:58:33	boobah	sounds like a pretty good combo
2016-04-08 05:58:35	nc	and the patches are really nice
2016-04-08 05:58:45	thlst	I'm writting a one-piece wm, btw
2016-04-08 05:58:54	dcat	thlst: using libwm?
2016-04-08 05:58:56	nc	thlst: in C?
2016-04-08 05:59:03	thlst	dcat: no
2016-04-08 05:59:04	nc	i should try one of the lisp ones at some point
2016-04-08 05:59:05	thlst	nc: C++
2016-04-08 05:59:08	boobah	dcat: interpret it however you want. wew was broken on my system and i didn't appreciate the wmutils model enough to fix it.
2016-04-08 05:59:09	nc	ah ok
2016-04-08 05:59:19	nc	boobah: but it's unixy!
2016-04-08 05:59:25	boobah	nc: that's the problem
2016-04-08 05:59:31	nc	how is that a problem?
2016-04-08 05:59:35	dcat	thlst: https://github.com/wmutils/libwm
2016-04-08 05:59:37	nc	the only issue is making sure you have all the  deps
2016-04-08 05:59:39	boobah	i'm not going to go into it
2016-04-08 05:59:43	thlst	I care more about speed and safety tbh
2016-04-08 05:59:48	nc	it's super flexible apart form that
2016-04-08 06:00:13	+fyr	boobah, you're one salty fella ain't ya
2016-04-08 06:00:15	boobah	flexibility isn't enough to tempt me away from its disadvantages
2016-04-08 06:00:24	thlst	dcat: I'm writting a wm to learn xcb
2016-04-08 06:00:27	boobah	fyr: only recently
2016-04-08 06:00:58	nc	boobah: the only reason i don't use it is because most "modern" apps are broken for it
2016-04-08 06:01:07	nc	anything that runs properly in x works fine in it
2016-04-08 06:01:21	nc	but games and stuff block it (which kinda annoys me)
2016-04-08 06:01:22	boobah	i remember having issues with xembed too
2016-04-08 06:01:28	boobah	not sure if anyone else had that problem
2016-04-08 06:01:33	+fyr	>xembed
2016-04-08 06:01:37	boobah	but at that point i was already like "fuck it"
2016-04-08 06:01:42	nc	i just wish x would be rewritten :(
2016-04-08 06:01:48	boobah	nc: do it then
2016-04-08 06:01:50	boobah	nc: many have tried
2016-04-08 06:01:58	nc	yea...
2016-04-08 06:02:03	dcat	nc: yeah, X is the biggest problem with *nix systems
2016-04-08 06:02:12	nc	i want something that just maps the windows a file system
2016-04-08 06:02:19	boobah	nc: that exists, multifold
2016-04-08 06:02:22	nc	then you could interact with it in any langauge
2016-04-08 06:02:23	+fyr	dcat, are you in favour of waylame then? :d
2016-04-08 06:02:27	dcat	no
2016-04-08 06:02:29	sshbio	That's why I don't use it :P
2016-04-08 06:02:34	dcat	cause I don't run linux
2016-04-08 06:02:34		[06:02]
2016-04-08 06:02:44	nc	dcat: what do you use?
2016-04-08 06:02:49	dcat	openbsd and osx
2016-04-08 06:02:54	nc	openbsd uses x tho
2016-04-08 06:02:55	+fyr	but linux is the best! /s
2016-04-08 06:02:58	+seth	maps the windows... to a filesystem...........
2016-04-08 06:03:02	+seth	so if I close a window
2016-04-08 06:03:04	dcat	nc: openbsd has forked X
2016-04-08 06:03:05	+seth	do I $ rm # it
2016-04-08 06:03:08	nc	seth: file dissapears
2016-04-08 06:03:12	nc	yeah, or you could do that
2016-04-08 06:03:14	+seth	but why...
2016-04-08 06:03:18	dcat	nc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenocara
2016-04-08 06:03:20	nc	because that's the unix way
2016-04-08 06:03:21	sshbio	seth: This have been done, it'l called wmfs or something
2016-04-08 06:03:33	 *	sshbio checks the name and link
2016-04-08 06:03:35	+seth	how do you control X and Y
2016-04-08 06:03:35	boobah	wmfs is also "window manager from scratch"
2016-04-08 06:03:35	nc	seth: you're devices, processes, etc are mapped to files
2016-04-08 06:03:41	nc	sshbio: yeah, but wmfs is hacky
2016-04-08 06:03:46	+seth	so you have to start a binary
2016-04-08 06:03:51	+seth	to interact with the windows
2016-04-08 06:03:52	boobah	i forgot the name, but i've seen at least two or three implementations of such a thing
2016-04-08 06:04:02	nc	seth: no no
2016-04-08 06:04:04	nc	it's plaintext
2016-04-08 06:04:08	sshbio	It did not seem as good as wmutils to me, indeed.
2016-04-08 06:04:26	nc	i.e. echo 20 >> /wmfs/curwindow/x
2016-04-08 06:04:27	nc	boom
2016-04-08 06:04:27	nc	moved
2016-04-08 06:04:32		ubuuu (ubuuu@2BE3D1AC.F55C891.FF38B6DF.IP) has quit (Lost terminal)
2016-04-08 06:04:42	nc	cat /wmfs/curwindow/x to get the current x
2016-04-08 06:04:54	+seth	nc
2016-04-08 06:04:58	+seth	that would append to that file
2016-04-08 06:05:10	dcat	it would not
2016-04-08 06:05:11	sshbio	Link ->  https://github.com/xorg62/wmfs
2016-04-08 06:05:11	+seth	so you'd have 10\n20
2016-04-08 06:05:14	+seth	>> ?
2016-04-08 06:05:15	nc	doesn't matter, it's a special file that handles writes properly
2016-04-08 06:05:27	+seth	echo inserts newlines :|
2016-04-08 06:05:40	+seth	you're talking about MMAP'd files, and usually they're pretty effing particular
2016-04-08 06:05:48	dcat	oh my bad, looking at the wrong command
2016-04-08 06:05:49	nc	seth: you can modify kernel params by redirecting ot file
2016-04-08 06:05:57	dcat	but still
2016-04-08 06:06:01	dcat	most likely it's using fifo's
2016-04-08 06:06:08	dcat	in which case it wouldn't matter
2016-04-08 06:06:08	nc	^^
2016-04-08 06:06:09	boobah	pretty sure one of them uses an actual FUSE filesystem
2016-04-08 06:06:15	+seth	yes, but we typically use sysctl instead
2016-04-08 06:06:16	nc	oh yeah
2016-04-08 06:06:17	nc	that's right 
2016-04-08 06:06:18	+seth	so we don't make silly typos
2016-04-08 06:06:25	nc	>:(
2016-04-08 06:06:29	nc	don't even
2016-04-08 06:06:33	nc	get me started on systemd
2016-04-08 06:06:40	+fyr	using cat instead of <
2016-04-08 06:06:44	+seth	sysctl is not systemd
2016-04-08 06:06:45	boobah	he said sysctl, not systemctl
2016-04-08 06:06:46	nc	the point isn't that you have to operate on files
2016-04-08 06:06:50	nc	it's that files are language agnostic
2016-04-08 06:06:58	boobah	^^ this
2016-04-08 06:07:02	nc	every language implements some sort of file io
2016-04-08 06:07:03	+seth	sysctl is how you change kernel parameters without getting balls deep into /proc and /sys
2016-04-08 06:07:24	+seth	$ sudo sysctl -a
2016-04-08 06:07:29	nc	seth: but it's doing the write redirects behind the scenes
2016-04-08 06:07:31	boobah	seth: yeah, he was probably thinking of systemctl
2016-04-08 06:07:34	nc	which makes the code simpler
2016-04-08 06:07:48	nc	there's no dumb xlib or xcb or anything
2016-04-08 06:08:29	boobah	nc: there still is. how do you think wmfs or whatever communicates with the X server?
2016-04-08 06:08:43	nc	i know that's how wmfs works
2016-04-08 06:08:54	nc	but i'm saying "nc's magic x thing" wouldn't do that
2016-04-08 06:09:11	nc	it'd just make a file tree that the user would interact with
2016-04-08 06:09:15	thlst	gtg, see yall
2016-04-08 06:09:20	nc	later thlst :)
2016-04-08 06:09:26	thlst	o/
2016-04-08 06:09:29	boobah	nc: again, how would the program serving that file tree communicate with X?

2016-04-08 06:09:58	nc	"nc's magic x thing" would be running as a daemon that watched/hosted the file tree
2016-04-08 06:10:00	@xero	can you guys do me a quick favor?
2016-04-08 06:10:03	nc	it wouldn't be the current x tree
2016-04-08 06:10:06	@xero	does m.shoebuy.com show an api or a website?
2016-04-08 06:10:15	nc	i mean x model of client/server
2016-04-08 06:10:27	nc	api
2016-04-08 06:10:33	@xero	fuuuuuck

2016-04-08 06:11:09	boobah	nc: if you expect to be able to read and make changes to X windows, you need some way to communicate with the X server

2016-04-08 06:11:16	nc	boobah: it's not an x server
2016-04-08 06:11:24	nc	just call it a the Y windowing daemon
2016-04-08 06:11:26	nc	it's a different model

2016-04-08 06:14:46	boobah	let's be honest. an X rewrite by a nixers individual is not gonna happen.
2016-04-08 06:14:53	boobah	the linux graphics stack is insane
2016-04-08 06:14:58	nc	might as well bite the bullet and just try to understand the old cruft that's already there

2016-04-08 06:32:21	@rocx	nc: ironically i mostly beat it as tails. flying instead of gliding.
2016-04-08 06:32:24	nc	lol, and i was like 8 and really bad at video games
2016-04-08 06:32:28	@rocx	AND SCREW THAT CARNIVAL ZONE ACT 2.
2016-04-08 06:32:38	@rocx	i never can beat that one without a time over.
2016-04-08 06:32:38		[06:32]
2016-04-08 06:32:42	@rocx	even now.
2016-04-08 06:32:47	nc	and the FREAKING WATER LEVELS
2016-04-08 06:32:54	nc	oh my gosh, one of the most annoying things of all time
2016-04-08 06:32:58	nc	worse than mario water levels
2016-04-08 06:32:59	@rocx	S2?
2016-04-08 06:33:02	nc	i guess
2016-04-08 06:33:16	@rocx	OH S3's hydrocity zone.
2016-04-08 06:33:20	@rocx	yeah i hated that one too.
2016-04-08 06:33:34	nc	that's the one
2016-04-08 06:33:42	nc	i'd run out of breath EVERY FRICKIN TIME
2016-04-08 06:33:54	@rocx	act 2 used to scare me a bit when i was a wee lad.
2016-04-08 06:34:01	@rocx	that was why i mainly played tails there.
2016-04-08 06:34:07	nc	just fly over everything
2016-04-08 06:34:14	@rocx	because i could outfly the wall of doom rather than spindash up the ramps.
2016-04-08 06:34:22	nc	ahhhh
2016-04-08 06:34:24	nc	good play
2016-04-08 06:34:28	@rocx	but you don't get the cool doomsday zone.
2016-04-08 06:34:32	nc	in the plug-n-play controller, they didn't have tails
2016-04-08 06:34:35	@rocx	fV:
2016-04-08 06:34:37	nc	so i had to use either sonic or knuckles
2016-04-08 06:34:53	@rocx	you sure you were playing S3(&K) or was it just S&K?

2016-04-08 06:37:40	nc	that was the one i played on ^^
2016-04-08 06:37:52	@rocx	oh
2016-04-08 06:37:57	nc	it was some modded version of s3 (i think)
2016-04-08 06:38:01	@rocx	fV:
2016-04-08 06:38:25	@rocx	you know what'd be better?
2016-04-08 06:38:31	nc	?
2016-04-08 06:38:43	@rocx	a more consistent version of sonic generations, with retro sonic only and NO SAVING
2016-04-08 06:38:51	@rocx	or if there is saving, do it like S3&K.
2016-04-08 06:38:56	nc	yas
2016-04-08 06:39:01	@rocx	AND MORE RESPONSIVE.
2016-04-08 06:39:03	nc	i played sonic 3 on my phone
2016-04-08 06:39:08	nc	and the auto save made it so much more boring
2016-04-08 06:39:11	@rocx	i swear it takes half a second to jump after pressing the button.
2016-04-08 06:39:12	nc	like, the tension isn't there
2016-04-08 06:39:20	@rocx	nc: oh the tension's there alright.
2016-04-08 06:39:29	@rocx	because you have to beat the whole zone.
2016-04-08 06:39:31	nc	rocx: not when you can save at any point
2016-04-08 06:39:37	nc	(in a zone)
2016-04-08 06:39:37	@rocx	oh that too
2016-04-08 06:39:40	@rocx	wait
2016-04-08 06:39:42	nc	on the iphone app at least
2016-04-08 06:39:44	@rocx	dang.
2016-04-08 06:40:03	@rocx	on the original, it only saved whenever you transitioned zones (not acts).
2016-04-08 06:40:12	@rocx	BUT IT ALSO LOGGED ALL THE SPECIAL STAGES YOU ATTEMPTED
2016-04-08 06:40:21	@rocx	so you can't reset-scum if you flunk a special stage.
2016-04-08 06:40:34	nc	and when you lost all your lives, back to the beginning
2016-04-08 06:40:41	nc	no hand holding
2016-04-08 06:40:45	@rocx	getting continues was piss easy though.
2016-04-08 06:40:46	nc	that's part of the issue of modern games
2016-04-08 06:40:57	nc	they aren't hard anymore
2016-04-08 06:41:02	@rocx	nc: to be fair, video games are lasting on an average of forty and more hours.
2016-04-08 06:41:11	nc	really?
2016-04-08 06:41:18	@rocx	they are now.
2016-04-08 06:41:26	@rocx	and they're meant to be played in multi-hour sessions.
2016-04-08 06:41:29	nc	for a lot of triple a games they're only 12-20 hours (For the ones i watch)
2016-04-08 06:41:45	tymscar	Sup guys
2016-04-08 06:41:46	@rocx	old games that didn't save had to be played in multi-hour sessions.
2016-04-08 06:41:57	nc	hey tymscar 
2016-04-08 06:41:59	@xero	gold old 32 char codes
2016-04-08 06:42:04	nc	lol
2016-04-08 06:42:16	@rocx	earthworm jim 2 would be my next favorite genesis game.
2016-04-08 06:42:18	@xero	s/gold/good/
2016-04-08 06:42:18	regx	<xero> good old 32 char codes
2016-04-08 06:42:32	nc	if they still did that i'd try brute forcing the codes
2016-04-08 06:42:34	nc	that would be fun
2016-04-08 06:42:34	@xero	kid chameleon
2016-04-08 06:42:39	nc	(with a script of course)
2016-04-08 06:42:44	nc	my first console was a ps1
2016-04-08 06:43:01	nc	really loved crash bandicoot

2016-04-08 06:43:45	tymscar	nc. Any advice where to learn more about linux/unix/arch?? i feel lost a bit with all the info. Its overwhelming and i feel like i know nothing :(
2016-04-08 06:43:54	@rocx	man.
2016-04-08 06:44:08	@rocx	we didn't get a 3D console until the gamecube in 2006.
2016-04-08 06:44:39	nc	tymscar: don't try to absorb it all at once (there's way too much info)
2016-04-08 06:44:46	@rocx	and our PC couldn't even play squat in the way of "video games".
2016-04-08 06:44:47	nc	just write little scripts that fix little annoyences you have
2016-04-08 06:44:57	@rocx	we were on windows 95 until the house burned down in 2004.
2016-04-08 06:44:58	nc	rocx: the gamecube had some awesome games
2016-04-08 06:45:04	+fyr	still no luck with getting this pi to boot
2016-04-08 06:45:09	+fyr	sigh
2016-04-08 06:45:11	@rocx	then it was winxp until 2010.
2016-04-08 06:45:17	nc	fyr: as in hardware failure?
2016-04-08 06:45:21	nc	rocx: THEN LINUX
2016-04-08 06:45:22	nc	FOR LIFE
2016-04-08 06:45:34	+fyr	nah I think I am doing something wrong with the sd card but I can't think what
2016-04-08 06:45:46	nc	tymscar: i learned most of my linux-fu through script writing and installing linux on weird hardware
2016-04-08 06:45:50	+fyr	apparently single red light means it can't read off the sdcard
2016-04-08 06:45:56	nc	fyr: did you partitition it right?
2016-04-08 06:46:03	+fyr	nc, well that's the thing
2016-04-08 06:46:03	nc	(and use the right fs type)
2016-04-08 06:46:10	+fyr	what is the right 'method'
2016-04-08 06:46:28	tymscar	the thing is nc. that i tried to install pacaur. and it gave me some wierd problems. and i feel lost. i want to do this on my own and people sy you shoudl read the manuals and all but its VERY overwhelming
2016-04-08 06:46:28	+fyr	I dunno because all this pi site says is 'use NOOBS!!1111!!'
2016-04-08 06:46:38	sshbio	fyr: How did you write to the sdcard?
2016-04-08 06:46:39	+fyr	and everywhere else is spotty instructions at best
2016-04-08 06:46:50	+fyr	sshbio, just fdisk
2016-04-08 06:46:54	+fyr	then dd the image over

2016-04-08 06:47:13	+fyr	at this point I think I am missing firmware
2016-04-08 06:47:22	sshbio	fyr: All I usually have to do is dd the image to the root partition.
2016-04-08 06:47:31	nc	tymscar: you could try yaourt too
2016-04-08 06:47:33	+fyr	that's what I'm doing
2016-04-08 06:47:33	nc	i use yaourt personally
2016-04-08 06:47:37	+fyr	but doesn't want to work
2016-04-08 06:47:41	nc	you have to build some packages manually
2016-04-08 06:47:41		[06:47]
2016-04-08 06:47:50	nc	but it's only like two, and then you can get everything in aur
2016-04-08 06:47:58	sshbio	 /dev/sdb but not /dev/sdb1.
2016-04-08 06:48:04	tymscar	i have yaourt but tudurom suggested me trying pacaur
2016-04-08 06:48:09	+fyr	yes I am doing it to /dev/sdb
2016-04-08 06:48:12	+fyr	:>
2016-04-08 06:48:14	tymscar	and i dont like not knowing stuff
2016-04-08 06:48:34	nc	tymscar: yaourt and pacaur are essentially the same thing
2016-04-08 06:48:47	nc	so installing pacaur doesn't really gain you anything

2016-04-08 06:49:01	@z3bra	time
2016-04-08 06:49:01	nc	fyr: is it fat32?
2016-04-08 06:49:02	@xero	both of those tools
2016-04-08 06:49:06	sshbio	I use apacman: It is a single script that sleeps in my /bin directory, and do not know how to install anything from aur manually :)
2016-04-08 06:49:07	nc	(the fs type)
2016-04-08 06:49:16	sshbio	fyr: What system do you use?
2016-04-08 06:49:21	nc	sshbio: wow, i'll have to try that out
2016-04-08 06:49:22	sshbio	Hi z3bra!
2016-04-08 06:49:25	@z3bra	o/
2016-04-08 06:49:29	+fyr	sshbio, ?
2016-04-08 06:50:16	sshbio	fyr: Sorry I meant what system are you willing to install on it?
2016-04-08 06:50:26	+fyr	alpine
2016-04-08 06:50:33	+fyr	I've found some stuff in the wiki
2016-04-08 06:50:37	nc	oh...
2016-04-08 06:50:41	nc	i haven't done that
2016-04-08 06:50:45	@xero	cd ~/builds && curl -L -O https://aur.archlinux.org/..../foo.tar.gz && tar -xvf foo.tar.gz && cd foo && makepkg -sri 
2016-04-08 06:50:53	@xero	it's dead simple
2016-04-08 06:51:01	@z3bra	then comes deps..
2016-04-08 06:51:07	nc	i've only installed arm archlinux
2016-04-08 06:51:31	nc	xero: only a 3 line command :P
2016-04-08 06:51:37	sshbio	fyr: That's why :/  But it would be really nice as a RPi distro!
2016-04-08 06:52:19	+fyr	?
2016-04-08 06:52:22	nc	sshbio: there's a raspberry pi build: http://alpinelinux.org/downloads/
2016-04-08 06:52:27	nc	(of alpine)
2016-04-08 06:52:27	+fyr	there is a rpi build
2016-04-08 06:52:31	+fyr	I'm not retarded lel
2016-04-08 06:53:28	sshbio	fyr: Yes, sure! I'm not meaning that at all! But if you can't install it, I hardly imagine how I would be able to.
2016-04-08 06:53:52	+fyr	I'm not expecting you to.. ?
2016-04-08 06:54:40	nc	fyr: did you partition as fat32 and mkfs.vfat?
2016-04-08 06:54:47	+fyr	ya
2016-04-08 06:54:48	nc	(sorry mkfs.fat)
2016-04-08 06:54:52	nc	hrm...
2016-04-08 06:54:57	nc	then that should have done it...
2016-04-08 06:55:08	nc	i'll have to try alpine at some point too
2016-04-08 06:55:13	nc	is it source based?
2016-04-08 06:55:26	sshbio	That is why I said it would have been nice as a RPi distro, as it could be if it worked and had enough documentation.
2016-04-08 06:55:36	+fyr	no
2016-04-08 06:55:56	sshbio	There is also void linux that seems nice.
2016-04-08 06:56:00	@rocx	no
2016-04-08 06:56:02	@rocx	not void linux
2016-04-08 06:56:12	nc	i tried void once
2016-04-08 06:56:13	@rocx	the packaging is retarded
2016-04-08 06:56:14	nc	it didn't work for me
2016-04-08 06:56:15	nc	yeah
2016-04-08 06:56:17	nc	i had issues with that
2016-04-08 06:56:20	sshbio	rocx: I never installed it.  Ah.
2016-04-08 06:56:24	@rocx	they let the community name the packages.
2016-04-08 06:56:29	nc	i'm surprised that crux doesn't use musl
2016-04-08 06:56:34	nc	it really should...
2016-04-08 06:56:42	+fyr	why?
2016-04-08 06:57:11	nc	'cause it's light weight and source based
2016-04-08 06:57:21	nc	so i'd assume it would use a lighter libc
2016-04-08 06:57:30	+fyr	gcc isn't that fat
2016-04-08 06:57:30	nc	but it uses glibc (i think)
2016-04-08 06:57:35	nc	glibc is
2016-04-08 06:57:41	 *	fyr shrugs
2016-04-08 06:57:45	sshbio	rocx: Ok. I think I will never ever look back at void linux.  How messy will this end!  LibGTKlib and freetype2lib-lib?
2016-04-08 06:57:55	+fyr	lots of softs depend on glibc
2016-04-08 06:58:22	nc	sshbio: yikes! that's almost as bad as debians packaging
2016-04-08 06:58:38	sshbio	eww. :/
2016-04-08 06:58:40	nc	fyr: http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html
2016-04-08 06:59:06	nc	glibc is really bloated
2016-04-08 07:00:14	@xero	gnahooo leeb see
2016-04-08 07:00:21	nc	and musl works with most things

2016-04-08 08:11:23	@rocx	also, 2f30 radio changed.
2016-04-08 08:11:54	@rocx	change your streams from .ogg to .mp3 because for some reason they decided to go with a proprietary one.
2016-04-08 08:12:12	@rocx	to the two of you who acknowledged it existed.
2016-04-08 08:12:22	+fyr	heh
2016-04-08 08:12:50	@rocx	now it became some EDM loop.
2016-04-08 08:13:27	@xero	MPEG-2.5 is the only proprietary part of mp3 iirc
2016-04-08 08:13:55	@rocx	maybe i'm just a paranoid ninny, okay?
2016-04-08 08:14:52	@xero	maybe i'm wrong, okay?

2016-04-08 08:16:57	@rocx	Maybe I'd just be more understanding of a *nix group to use free alterantives rather than mp3.

2016-04-08 09:06:34	Loki123	tell me what you think :P 
2016-04-08 09:06:35	+fyr	the problem with numpads is they're on the wrong side of the keyboard for right handers
2016-04-08 09:06:47	+fyr	means I have to take my hand off the mouse to use it effectively
2016-04-08 09:07:11	nc	fyr: that's true too
2016-04-08 09:07:36	+fyr	80% are okay
2016-04-08 09:07:49	+fyr	like quickfire tk (I think)
2016-04-08 09:07:58	+fyr	but the numpad is on the wrong side
2016-04-08 09:08:13	+fyr	how keyboard manufacturers have not picked up on this I'll never know
2016-04-08 09:08:21	nc	nah, i like having arrow keys
2016-04-08 09:08:28	+fyr	meh
2016-04-08 09:08:34	nc	if i can't have them, i don't particularly want a numpad

2016-04-08 18:16:41	sq271	tA: i'm good, two glasses of wine in it is after 1am here.. i'm trying to call it an early night..
2016-04-08 18:17:20	sq271	tA: i've been reading the K&R C book. i'm stoked about it, i've put it off for way too long.
2016-04-08 18:17:41	tA	Ive tinkered here and there for ages but never really went further, its really fun though Im enjoying it
2016-04-08 18:18:46	tA	Oooh that book is at my Uni Book Shop, Im always super tempted but I dont have the money to get it at the moment
2016-04-08 18:18:57	sq271	lower level is what intrigues me, but i've been caught up in webdev bs.. just trying to get a job.. 
2016-04-08 18:20:02	@venam	last time I really worked with C was 3 years ago
2016-04-08 18:20:12	tA	Yeah Im hoping to do lower level once I finish my course but probs gonna be same and have to take whatever gets thrown at me
2016-04-08 18:20:14	@venam	was deep into the "Advanced Linux Programming book"
2016-04-08 18:20:20	@venam	then I didn't use any of that

2016-04-08 18:23:50	sq271	venam: like it was always changing and incompatible, what is there to retain?
2016-04-08 18:24:08	@venam	sq271: then in the end your resume only contains one thing
2016-04-08 18:24:27	@venam	and the person interviewing you will ask "didn't you work with anything else?"
2016-04-08 18:24:48	@venam	but if you put it and someone asks you very technical details you won't be able to answer either
2016-04-08 18:24:51	sq271	venam: yeah, i'm stuck, i don't know how to make any of this shit into a job..

2016-04-08 20:54:38	tA	ALthough I guess theres a lot of merit in writing it yourself regardless
2016-04-08 20:55:06	tA	thlst: Not trying to say you shouldnt, just genuinely interested, what sorta stuff do you need in a wm?
2016-04-08 20:56:08	thlst	I need it to be minimalist, but with groups instead of workspaces
2016-04-08 20:56:14	thlst	and flexible

2016-04-08 21:02:25	tymscar	what do you guys mean by groups?
2016-04-08 21:02:31	tymscar	i knwo waht a workspace is
2016-04-08 21:03:51	thlst	you can group windows, as it would be with workspaces, but difference is that you can hide/unhide groups, regardless of others

2016-04-08 21:10:36	 *	tudurom tips fedora
2016-04-08 21:11:09	tudurom	fyr: a fast way to make multihead working is saving the xrandr output in a file when you start fyre
2016-04-08 21:11:21	tudurom	and then using the file
2016-04-08 21:12:05	thlst	tymscar: what is your field in gamedev?
2016-04-08 21:12:36	tudurom	tymscar: bspwm is good because you have more flexibility in scripting. this way you learn shell scripting and unix
2016-04-08 21:13:04	tA	thlst: That worked, looks super interesting
2016-04-08 21:14:22	tymscar	Good point tudurom 
2016-04-08 21:14:22		[21:14]
2016-04-08 21:15:25	tudurom	i mostly learned shell scripting from scripting my bar
2016-04-08 21:15:27	tudurom	ricing helps
2016-04-08 21:17:20	thlst	rice is the best tool
2016-04-08 21:18:56	tudurom	hooray my wmutils setup is now multihead
2016-04-08 21:20:41	tA	tudurom: What wm and bar do you use?
2016-04-08 21:21:07	tudurom	wm is wmutils. bar is lemonbar + huge script
2016-04-08 21:23:30	tA	The bar sounds interesting, would you mind sharing a screenshot?

2016-04-08 21:29:36	tudurom	the only diff between this screenshot and the last one i posted on unixporn is the wallpaper and the OS
2016-04-08 21:30:01	tudurom	tA: you color scheme is custom?
2016-04-08 21:30:08	tudurom	it looks nice beside the i3bar
2016-04-08 21:30:41	tA	Yeah I wanna go to lemonbar regardless cos I really dont like the bar
2016-04-08 21:31:07	tA	Colourscheme is semi custom, its a slightly tweaked version of one I found on terminal.sexy ages ago iirc
2016-04-08 21:31:13	tudurom	tA: you also host your server on a Pi?
2016-04-08 21:31:23	tudurom	yours is older and slower
2016-04-08 21:31:27	tudurom	i see
2016-04-08 21:32:24	thlst	I'd really like to use a bar, but it bothers me more than it helps
2016-04-08 21:33:07	tudurom	i want to divide mine in 2 small bars: one for groups and one for the time and music
2016-04-08 21:33:07	tA	tudurom: Yeah its a B+ from the first lot of models, dont really use it for much just wanted to see if I could get something set up
2016-04-08 21:33:33	%kirby	I run a pretty useful server on a Pi

2016-04-08 22:39:31	%kirby	Why not start?
2016-04-08 22:39:54	tA	Yeah I felt the same way, then I got the bug after first installing i3
2016-04-08 22:40:02	tA	Its pretty fun even if just to mess around in
2016-04-08 22:40:33	m00n_urn	first i tried installing freebsd but then i've failed and then the same happened with Arch. So i just settled with Ubuntu :\
2016-04-08 22:42:26	tA	ut failing is the fun
2016-04-08 22:42:26		[22:42]

2016-04-08 22:42:45	tA	And when you fix it you feel great
2016-04-08 22:43:04	%kirby	You can still rice Ubuntu
2016-04-08 22:43:19	%kirby	OS really doesn't matter, just go with what you like
2016-04-08 22:43:49	thlst	it's harder, since ubuntu is full glitter
2016-04-08 22:44:05	%kirby	A lot of people here pick things like Crux or whatever because it's what suits them best, but in terms of ricing it's all the same
2016-04-08 22:44:23	m00n_urn	thlst: is that supposed to rhyme or something? :D
2016-04-08 22:44:25	%kirby	Eh not really thlst, you can still just uninstall the display manager and use a wm
2016-04-08 22:45:05	%kirby	Or not even that when I first started I had cinnammon and awesomewm installed and went through gdm
2016-04-08 22:45:10	m00n_urn	kirby: you could do that but it would all around malfunction :\
2016-04-08 22:45:28	thlst	kirby: ubuntu has a lot of dependencies, and it makes more sense to start with nothing at all
2016-04-08 22:45:58	%kirby	It would be a bit clunky but eh whatever
2016-04-08 22:46:06	thlst	you know, I use my rice, it's not just about fancy
2016-04-08 22:46:08	%kirby	You could install the server version of Ubuntu and build off that
2016-04-08 22:46:23	%kirby	Same installation as Ubuntu so not hard, but you get dumped to a console after
2016-04-08 22:46:33	%kirby	And build off that
2016-04-08 22:47:34	m00n_urn	one of these days i will purge ubuntu and install freebsd...
2016-04-08 22:48:59	%kirby	I never really liked FreeBSD
2016-04-08 22:49:16	%kirby	I really like the philosophy behind OpenBSd but I've never got around to installing it

2016-04-09 00:06:53	%stark	dcat, how about slackware ?
2016-04-09 00:07:02	@dcat	I would
2016-04-09 00:07:11	@dcat	but I'll just end up in dependency hell
2016-04-09 00:07:27	tudurom	just like on crux when you want to clean the system
2016-04-09 00:07:57	@dcat	might as well just get arch linux
2016-04-09 00:08:03	@dcat	then get rid of the arch part

2016-04-09 00:09:28	%stark	I remember when I spent 2 hours installing slackware and uninstalled after 10 mins of usage
2016-04-09 00:10:12	@dcat	I mean, I really like slackware
2016-04-09 00:10:21	@dcat	it's probably my favourite distro
2016-04-09 00:10:44	@dcat	but what I want is a lightweight distro I can set up fast
2016-04-09 00:10:51	@dcat	and add voice control to
2016-04-09 00:11:36	@dcat	I'd like to have a machine that can play music, look up schematics (pdf's and such), browse the web, etc

2016-04-09 00:23:00	@dcat	if we all started working on a small distro

2016-04-09 00:23:29	@dcat	especially if we make it to boot off of usb
2016-04-09 00:24:47	@dcat	or, I guess, qemu would be better

2016-04-09 00:25:49	@dcat	what's the most lightweight usable bootloader?
2016-04-09 00:25:54	vompatti	syslinux
2016-04-09 00:25:57	vompatti	?
2016-04-09 00:26:03	@dcat	isn't syslinux pretty bloated?
2016-04-09 00:26:08	vompatti	dunno, I use it
2016-04-09 00:26:24	tudurom	EFISTUB, for efi
2016-04-09 00:26:30	tudurom	because with EFISTUB there's no bootloader
2016-04-09 00:26:33	@dcat	oh yeah shit there's efi too
2016-04-09 00:26:43	@xero	>Syslinux is a collection of boot loaders capable of booting from hard drives, CDs, and over the network via PXE. It supports the FAT, ext2, ext3, ext4, and Btrfs file systems.
2016-04-09 00:26:43		[00:26]
2016-04-09 00:26:48	@dcat	does all efi have a legacy mode?
2016-04-09 00:26:53	@xero	no
2016-04-09 00:26:57	@xero	but *most* do
2016-04-09 00:27:09	tudurom	there are boards with 32bit cpu and efi on them
2016-04-09 00:27:10	vompatti	xero: "usable" was requirment
2016-04-09 00:27:31	tudurom	syslinux is not as bloated as grub
2016-04-09 00:27:38	@dcat	obviously not lele
2016-04-09 00:27:59	@dcat	what's that really simple one that everyone used back in 2007
2016-04-09 00:28:06	%stark	LILO ?
2016-04-09 00:28:07	@dcat	just shows up with a ':' prompt

2016-04-09 01:20:41	+seth	I use │ instead of | for vertical separation

2016-04-09 01:25:03	@xero	http://sethdmoore.github.io/
2016-04-09 01:25:06	@xero	could be a thing

2016-04-09 04:20:37	+seth	I'm not sure if you'd count "cave drawings" as an analogy to tagging, more like hanging paintings on the wall
2016-04-09 04:20:55	@xero	no offence, but i like dcat's actual regx more

2016-04-09 04:26:49	@xero	the chromebook is a modernday dumb terminal for him
2016-04-09 04:26:50	nc	but i can't ssh at school because the network is stupid and blocks all ports but 80
2016-04-09 04:26:50	Lola	Yea, I kinda want a tiny, cheapass little notebook to do that with
2016-04-09 04:27:06	@xero	nc: make an ssh tunnel

2016-04-09 04:27:16	nc	my uncle lives there
2016-04-09 04:27:19	@xero	or have your vps do ssh on port 80
2016-04-09 04:27:40	nc	vps is a pain to setup tho
2016-04-09 04:27:47	@rocx	xero: and i'm more surprised that chromebooks aren't already trumpign windows laptops as it is.
2016-04-09 04:27:48	nc	i tried to set it up on a rpi at home
2016-04-09 04:27:53	nc	but i couldn't get it to install right

2016-04-09 04:28:08	nc	they do everything most people use
2016-04-09 04:28:11	@xero	vps is just as easy to setup as any box
2016-04-09 04:28:14	nc	and they're way fast
2016-04-09 04:28:15	@rocx	since everyone acts like big g is sooooo innovative and ~bringing us to the sci-fi future we always had wet dreams aboug~.
2016-04-09 04:28:16	@xero	it's just headless and remote
2016-04-09 04:28:19	@rocx	nc: nOOOOOo!
2016-04-09 04:28:31	nc	...
2016-04-09 04:28:39	nc	i would install crux if i could
2016-04-09 04:28:39	@rocx	they need to run less of a monopoly!
2016-04-09 04:28:56	@rocx	Ein Browser, Ein OS, Ein Intenet. that's their motto.
2016-04-09 04:28:57	nc	sure.. but the tech that comes out of them is surprisingly good for a large company
2016-04-09 04:29:19	nc	way better than apple or any other large scale tech manufacturer
2016-04-09 04:30:11	@rocx	nc: no i would beg to differ.
2016-04-09 04:30:38	nc	android allows you to get a temrinal running in 3 seconds
2016-04-09 04:30:40	@rocx	big g already runs an almost monopoly on many fronts.
2016-04-09 04:30:45	nc	(no rooting required)
2016-04-09 04:30:53	nc	they have a lot of open code
2016-04-09 04:31:00	@rocx	search engine, browser, media, you name it.
2016-04-09 04:31:05	@xero	nc wich do you use? (android term emu)
2016-04-09 04:31:06	nc	ok that i agree with
2016-04-09 04:31:12	nc	i don't want them collecting all my data
2016-04-09 04:31:22	@xero	too late for that
2016-04-09 04:31:22	nc	i use termux
2016-04-09 04:31:26	nc	^^
2016-04-09 04:31:27	nc	that's true
2016-04-09 04:31:28	@xero	cool, me too
2016-04-09 04:31:32	@rocx	nc: my issue is less of the datamining and more that i don't believe they should be responsible for dictating what the internet can and can't do
2016-04-09 04:31:39	@rocx	their ideal can: everything, can't: nothing
2016-04-09 04:31:43	nc	yeah that's true
2016-04-09 04:31:59	@rocx	their protocol SPDY becoming HTTP2 is the next step of dominating the world wide web.
2016-04-09 04:32:01	nc	they (almost certianly) regulate the search results
2016-04-09 04:32:11	@xero	they dont dictate anything directly. they just create an idea for a standard, and everyone falls all overthemeselves about it
2016-04-09 04:32:16	@rocx	nc: they do and change it per person.
2016-04-09 04:32:19	@xero	that's not *directly* them
2016-04-09 04:32:24	@xero	as much as everyone else around them
2016-04-09 04:32:37	@rocx	xero: that's the problem.
2016-04-09 04:32:53	@rocx	no one seems to recognize the horrors of one company running almost every front of an entire industry.
2016-04-09 04:32:54	nc	i think there are corners of google that are pretty good
2016-04-09 04:33:03	@rocx	nc: youtube used to be good back when it was independent.
2016-04-09 04:33:03		[04:33]
2016-04-09 04:33:10	@xero	there's a google office here in pittsburgh
2016-04-09 04:33:15	nc	but they don't really have a monopoly on anything but search
2016-04-09 04:33:17	@rocx	but google videos wasn't taking off so they bought the competition.

2016-04-09 05:11:57	@rocx	because the whole gist of it is that everything's a mod in a sense.
2016-04-09 05:12:24	@rocx	which is how MC should have been done if modding was in mind.
2016-04-09 05:12:27	+seth	are there no mobs?

2016-04-09 05:12:51	@rocx	you could download a mod for them.

2016-04-09 05:33:53	@fro	mostly women
2016-04-09 05:34:03	thang1	I type on mine with the soft loving caress of someone trying not to murder a kitten when they cuddle it
2016-04-09 05:34:03		[05:34]
2016-04-09 05:34:12	@fro	my old office mate would talk on speaker phone all the time

2016-04-09 05:35:43	@rocx	happy hacking keyboard 2 pro.
2016-04-09 05:35:49	@rocx	i only have the lite one.
2016-04-09 05:36:03	@fro	by the time you can afford one the 3 will be out
2016-04-09 05:36:09	@rocx	true/
2016-04-09 05:36:25	@rocx	or an ultimate hacking keyboard.
2016-04-09 05:36:28	@fro	i only spent $100 on mine
2016-04-09 05:36:33	@fro	got a deal
2016-04-09 05:36:44	@fro	i see some for around that now
2016-04-09 05:37:01	@fro	125 for blues
2016-04-09 05:37:04	@fro	which is what i got
2016-04-09 05:37:14	humhum	a vortex poker II would be enough for me....
2016-04-09 05:37:39	@fro	i'd take a 3
2016-04-09 05:38:15	@fro	resale value on all mechs is still insane
2016-04-09 05:38:39	boobah	still need to cad my mounting plate. i've been so lazy with this project.
2016-04-09 05:39:07	humhum	yeah fro but i think the 3 is quite expensive.
2016-04-09 05:39:17	humhum	a 2 would be enough for me tbh
2016-04-09 05:39:23	@fro	nah
2016-04-09 05:39:26	@fro	it's not that bad
2016-04-09 05:39:30	@fro	depending on switches and color
2016-04-09 05:39:35	@fro	i see some for around 130
2016-04-09 05:39:54	boobah	that's pennies compared to the korean ones.
2016-04-09 05:40:26	boobah	rocx: just get one man :)
2016-04-09 05:40:27	humhum	actually you are right fro not much more expensive than the poker 2
2016-04-09 05:40:40	@fro	yeah
2016-04-09 05:40:50	@fro	and it'll hold its value for a while
2016-04-09 05:41:04	@fro	i can sell my fc660 for at least what i paid for it
2016-04-09 05:41:17	@fro	and i've had it for a few years now
2016-04-09 05:41:51	boobah	not diggin' topres fro?
2016-04-09 05:41:58	@fro	i want one
2016-04-09 05:42:02	@fro	haven't tried one yet
2016-04-09 05:42:13	boobah	isn't the fc660 topre?
2016-04-09 05:42:23	@fro	sorry fc660m

2016-04-09 05:42:29	boobah	oh, that one
2016-04-09 05:42:37	@fro	but yeah if you drop the m it's topre
2016-04-09 05:42:38	@fro	ha
2016-04-09 05:42:43	@fro	those are like 200+
2016-04-09 05:42:47	boobah	yup
2016-04-09 05:43:31	+fyr	I'd bet any money to say that topre's are overrated
2016-04-09 05:43:43	boobah	"fancy rubberdomes"
2016-04-09 05:43:59	boobah	i'll bet they're okay, but not worth the prices they demand for them
2016-04-09 05:44:58	boobah	oddly enough, i type best on shitty keyboards. sucks.
2016-04-09 05:45:16	boobah	despite the handful of nice ones i have, i still use the cheap ones.
2016-04-09 05:49:01	+fyr	sure they'll be usable
2016-04-09 05:49:08	+fyr	I don't like the design though
2016-04-09 05:49:08		[05:49]
2016-04-09 05:49:21	+fyr	I relegate the usual ctrl key to my meta key now
2016-04-09 05:49:33	+fyr	on topre's that key doesn't exist
2016-04-09 05:49:44	+fyr	for 'reasons'

2016-04-09 06:58:02	@rocx	huh.
2016-04-09 06:58:37	@rocx	xero: common lisp kind of has the unofficial motto of "being made from strange alien technology" with the land of lisp alien holding a lisp flag.

2016-04-09 07:04:50	@xero	nah
2016-04-09 07:04:57	@xero	it cant got all weekend
2016-04-09 07:05:01	+seth	^ that is not speaking from experience
2016-04-09 07:05:07	@xero	i'd rather do it in the office than on call on the weekend
2016-04-09 07:05:07	+seth	you should have talked to me over thanksgiving
2016-04-09 07:05:14	+seth	that's what I mean
2016-04-09 07:05:19	+seth	if you do it monday morning, you have all 8 hours
2016-04-09 07:05:27	+seth	plus lingering issues can be solved tuesday
2016-04-09 07:05:41	@xero	what i'm saying is it will not make it through the weekend if you fail on monday
2016-04-09 07:06:15	+seth	maybe I'm not understanding 'failover friday', what it sounds like *to me* is you're intentionally testing the failover of the cluster... on a friday
2016-04-09 07:06:42	@xero	we get to the point where the memory is almost gone and it's gonna fail on it's own
2016-04-09 07:06:50	@xero	and ususally it doesnt do well on it's onw
2016-04-09 07:06:51	@xero	own
2016-04-09 07:06:55	+seth	memory consumption is still an issue?
2016-04-09 07:07:03	@xero	so we manully fail over to make it work as expected
2016-04-09 07:07:04	+seth	change the JVM params so it doesn't use that much mem
2016-04-09 07:07:10	@xero	we tried that
2016-04-09 07:07:16	@xero	the heap is huge
2016-04-09 07:07:19	+seth	-Xmx4096
2016-04-09 07:07:24	+seth	yeah it's actually really bad when it's huge
2016-04-09 07:07:29	@rocx	boobah: vypr's a chicken scheme guy, i'm more elisp than common lisp becaue cl sucks when there is almost one API per task and its docs suck.
2016-04-09 07:07:30	@xero	it's shane's bag
2016-04-09 07:07:31	+seth	cause GC will take too long
2016-04-09 07:07:33	@xero	so isk
2016-04-09 07:07:41	@xero	i just run port authority and hope
2016-04-09 07:07:43	@xero	lel
2016-04-09 07:07:49	+seth	well tell them (from me) that big heap = very bad
2016-04-09 07:07:54	+seth	long GC pauses = bad
2016-04-09 07:08:00	@xero	he just left
2016-04-09 07:08:02	@xero	so on monday
2016-04-09 07:08:05	+seth	ok
2016-04-09 07:08:11	@xero	he's been saying later and later
2016-04-09 07:08:15	+seth	yeah the bigger the heap, the longer the pause
2016-04-09 07:08:17	@xero	like 12hr days
2016-04-09 07:08:18	+seth	poor shane
2016-04-09 07:08:23	@xero	work -o- holic
2016-04-09 07:08:30	@xero	dan doesnt want him to work that much

2016-04-09 15:20:40	tA	I never got around to using tmux
2016-04-09 15:21:54	sq271	tmux is my everything
2016-04-09 15:23:08	sq271	tA: what are you tweakin on your configs?
2016-04-09 15:23:52	tA	Hotkeys at the moment
2016-04-09 15:24:44	tA	I had problems with the example thing cos the vi keys are wrong for me, and when I replaced them there must have been conflicts
2016-04-09 15:24:58	tA	So just gonna go through and add commands one by one, and that way I also dont add anything I dont know
2016-04-09 15:26:56	sq271	tA: there are just soo many keybindings, and figuring out the ones you want is sooo hard.. there is just sooo much about vim i don't know.. haha
2016-04-09 15:27:30	tA	I use Vim mainly but Im terrible at doing it well haha
2016-04-09 15:27:59	tA	Main thing when it comes to Vi keys in WM's though is the layout is for qwerty so they dont line up nicely
2016-04-09 15:28:08	tA	It'll be fun to mess around with though
2016-04-09 15:29:29	sq271	tA: i'm qwerty, what are you? haha
2016-04-09 15:29:38	tA	Dvorak
2016-04-09 15:29:52	tA	Cos I like being difficult apparently haha
2016-04-09 15:30:15	sq271	is Dvorak just like completely kick ass in every way? i imagine it as so..
2016-04-09 15:30:41	sq271	...plz confirm...
2016-04-09 15:31:01	sq271	i wanna switch someday..
2016-04-09 15:32:40	tA	I originally switched just cos I was curious but I have definitely noticed it being easier on my hands
2016-04-09 15:32:43	tA	If not by a little bit
2016-04-09 15:33:57	sq271	tA: how long have you been all dvorak? is qwerty completely foreign now?

2016-04-09 15:34:52	tA	Since start of last year, and mostly haha but if I spend more than 10 or so minutes in qwerty it starts to come back to m a lil
2016-04-09 15:36:26	sq271	tA: i am afraid of flushing qwerty completely out of my brain.. 
2016-04-09 15:36:55	sq271	tA: i just don't know if i'm smart enough to be able to do that.. haha
2016-04-09 15:37:05	tA	Its definitely a concern
2016-04-09 15:38:18	sq271	tA: i truly believe that dvorak makes sense, what is the cost of completely switching.. ?
2016-04-09 15:38:57	tA	Depending on some work / uni setups you might still have to use qwerty, although thats not often nowadays
2016-04-09 15:39:14	sq271	tA: i've wanted to switch for soo long, tell me it's awesome!
2016-04-09 15:39:24	tA	I definitely prefer it :P
2016-04-09 15:40:06	sq271	i don't know what the work world is.. i don't know what is 'gulp

2016-04-09 15:44:12	sq271	tA: i'm  28, i'm a fuckton of irrelevant experiences, haha..
2016-04-09 15:44:33	tA	My one prospect at the moment is a software company in Melbourne, my Dad used to work with the guy who owns it now, although thats more of the businessy / database side of it and not the software dev that I enjoy

2016-04-11 11:56:22	tA	Ok back sorry bout that
2016-04-11 11:56:24	greduan	Glad somebody's finally doing it
2016-04-11 11:56:33	greduan	so I guess that means soon I could try out Emacs seriously, I guess
2016-04-11 11:56:36	@rocx	i was going to as i learn how to use elisp to make real things.
2016-04-11 11:56:48	@rocx	usable things. as of now, i'm still tinkering with it to expand workflow.
2016-04-11 11:57:26	@rocx	part of the problem it feels like is that there's not a whole lot of functions obviously exposed.
2016-04-11 11:58:05	@rocx	i mean, this function i found basically changes ERC buffers because apparently, ERC keeps track of what buffers are ERC a la (erc-buffer-list).
2016-04-11 11:58:07	tA	rocx: I remember switching from mupdf to zathura because mupdf snap to the next page when youre scrolling and I couldnt figure out how to disable that
2016-04-11 11:58:33	@rocx	but on the bright side, making more use of mode hooks.
2016-04-11 11:58:37	@rocx	and mode maps.
2016-04-11 11:59:11	@rocx	bound super-n to go to the next ERC buffer.
2016-04-11 11:59:28	@rocx	greduan: starting to use it seriously for workflow purposes is something that will come in handy.
2016-04-11 12:01:03	greduan	Yeah, I just want a good text editor
2016-04-11 12:01:03		[12:01]
2016-04-11 12:01:08	greduan	Emacs sucks at text editing
2016-04-11 12:01:11	greduan	and Evil doesn't feel right
2016-04-11 12:01:19	greduan	so if composable.el feels right, that's awesome
2016-04-11 12:01:23	greduan	cause it means I can switch text editor
2016-04-11 12:01:24	@rocx	here's hoping either guile emacs takes off or we get a less complex emacs.
2016-04-11 12:01:33	greduan	although I've a pretty sick workflow in Vim atm
2016-04-11 12:02:05	tA	Vim is nice
2016-04-11 12:03:07	@rocx	it kind of feels like a hackjob for some reason.
2016-04-11 12:03:13	@rocx	neovim doesn't really solve the problem either.
2016-04-11 12:03:30	@rocx	comes with a terminal emulator and uses cmake.
2016-04-11 12:04:51	tA	rocx: Also for some reason I cant focus mupdf in bspwm

2016-04-11 15:25:12	sq271	waaaaasup acg?

2016-04-11 15:26:40	acg	switch timezone w/ me
2016-04-11 15:26:51	sq271	eating the shit i deserve, meant i've been in seattle for six months, and these hills are insane, but i haven't bombed one big enough yet, haha.
2016-04-11 15:27:03	sq271	acg: where are you?
2016-04-11 15:27:51	acg	panama, 00:28. have differential equations exam tomorrow
2016-04-11 15:28:00	acg	and here i am... procrastinating..

2016-04-11 15:29:38	acg	sq271, actually nothing. i know the topics pretty well but i have to bring 5 homeworks
2016-04-11 15:31:21	sq271	acg: well *sympathies*, i could never go back to college. was close, but didn't finish.. 
2016-04-11 15:31:44	acg	hate homework too?
2016-04-11 15:32:36	sq271	acg: i was actually pretty academic, i just became someone else after it all.. i don't know how to do any of that anymore.
2016-04-11 15:34:22	acg	kinda different. i ended high school and joined university pretty much forced
2016-04-11 15:34:28	sq271	acg: i would have really enjoyed a cs program, that is really where i should have gone. 
2016-04-11 15:34:43	acg	what did you choose, sq271 ?
2016-04-11 15:34:49	sq271	acg: i got roped into my college shit too.. i did seminary
2016-04-11 15:35:08	sq271	three and a half years, i got kicked out, the whole experience was a fantastical joke
2016-04-11 15:35:52	boobah	i'm close to getting kicked out right now, i gotta be careful
2016-04-11 15:36:20	sq271	boobah: i don't regret it yo, haha
2016-04-11 15:36:25	acg	hahaha
2016-04-11 15:36:25		[15:36]
2016-04-11 15:36:38	acg	starting 2nd year so can't say much about it... yet..
2016-04-11 15:36:48	sq271	boobah: if you're degree will mean something in the end, then atleast think about it before you let yourself be stupid.
2016-04-11 15:36:52	boobah	i know i'll be mad at myself in five years if i get dropped
2016-04-11 15:37:23	boobah	that means i gotta haul ass :)
2016-04-11 15:37:40	sq271	boobah: what are you shooting for?
2016-04-11 15:37:49	sq271	acg: what are you shooting for?
2016-04-11 15:37:56	boobah	sq271: a 2.25
2016-04-11 15:37:59	acg	software engineering
2016-04-11 15:38:05	boobah	sq271: computer engineering
2016-04-11 15:38:35	acg	but i'm more into research than selling products
2016-04-11 15:38:54	sq271	boobah & acg: both sound cool.. i don't really know what those entail.. 
2016-04-11 15:39:26	boobah	computer engineering is like hardware/software integration. embedded systems. cpu architecture design. digital circuits. logic. :)
2016-04-11 15:39:43	acg	^ boobah that's too interesting
2016-04-11 15:40:03	acg	mine has to do with software development "process" and lifecycle
2016-04-11 15:40:12	boobah	don't you guys do reverse engineering too?
2016-04-11 15:40:20	boobah	i want to learn to do proper disassembly
2016-04-11 15:41:06	sq271	boobah: that sounds cool, i'd love to learn architecture design
2016-04-11 15:41:07	acg	i do, but it's because i like more technical stuff. the career doesn't really show much technical or cs stuff
2016-04-11 15:41:11	acg	at least not in this country
2016-04-11 15:41:43	sq271	i wanna learn assembly too! i haven't touched it since before everything went 64bit.. i don't even know what that changed.. i'm outta touch.
2016-04-11 15:41:54	acg	boobah, been reading this book... "Reverse Engineering for Beginners" by Dennis Yurichev
2016-04-11 15:41:54	boobah	hmm. i'm in the US but the only other s/w engineer i know is in australia :)
2016-04-11 15:42:05	boobah	neat
2016-04-11 15:43:27	acg	soon you'll know another from panama?
2016-04-11 15:43:33	boobah	:DD
2016-04-11 15:46:29	sq271	boobah: where are you? be as vague as you'd like.. i see you also somewhere on freenode.. 
2016-04-11 15:46:54	sq271	i idle a whole bunch of channels, haha
2016-04-11 15:47:19	boobah	sq271: haha, i'm from the chicago area
2016-04-11 15:47:26	boobah	sq271: you?
2016-04-11 15:47:29	sq271	i only talk drvnk, is that okay? ha
2016-04-11 15:47:36	sq271	i'm in seattle
2016-04-11 15:47:43	boobah	ah cool
2016-04-11 15:47:47	boobah	only been there once :D
2016-04-11 15:47:51	boobah	it's hilly!
2016-04-11 15:47:55	boobah	(for a big city, that is)
2016-04-11 15:48:04	sq271	it is hilly af!
2016-04-11 15:48:17	sq271	i came up from portland, i've been here for six months
2016-04-11 15:48:28	boobah	portland's cool. i like portland.
2016-04-11 15:48:54	sq271	i left portland, to let some fux live, i regret it every passing moment, trying to pretend otherwise.. ha
2016-04-11 15:48:57	sq271	god damn, ha
2016-04-11 15:49:33	sq271	portland was my first home, i still wonder if i should just be going back right now..
2016-04-11 15:49:36	boobah	my aunt lives there. she just bought a house.
2016-04-11 15:49:47	boobah	portland aka hipster-ville :)
2016-04-11 15:49:59	sq271	what part of portland? i was north and northeast mostly.. 
2016-04-11 15:50:07	sq271	i was transient.
2016-04-11 15:50:08	boobah	i actually have no idea
2016-04-11 15:50:12	boobah	i wasn't driving :D
2016-04-11 15:50:21	sq271	portland is hipsterville
2016-04-11 15:50:50	sq271	portland, when you're there, the hipster shit is everywhere and easy to tune out... 
2016-04-11 15:51:04	boobah	if i lived there i'd probably just embrace it
2016-04-11 15:51:12	boobah	that, and all the moss that seems to grow on cars there
2016-04-11 15:51:16	sq271	i'd be labelled as a hipster, ya do so to be invisible.. ha
2016-04-11 15:51:45	sq271	moss is life everywhere there
2016-04-11 15:51:45		[15:51]
2016-04-11 15:51:45	fsociety	doesn't help that the tv show portlandia helps to unify portland's hipster appeal
2016-04-11 15:52:14	boobah	fsociety: oh yeah, forgot about that
2016-04-11 15:52:15	sq271	i've never watched it, however the last face on the intro is a close friend of mine
2016-04-11 15:52:29	boobah	fsociety: never seen it but i hear about it from time to time
2016-04-11 15:52:35	fsociety	funny how that show went from giving hipsters shit to embracing the culture. the show is awful now
2016-04-11 15:52:41	sq271	i hated portlandia, slit their throats.
2016-04-11 15:52:50	boobah	:)
2016-04-11 15:52:52	sq271	they werent' even good at it...
2016-04-11 15:53:06	reves	is the nixers podcast a thing that still happens?
2016-04-11 15:53:07	sq271	it doesn't convey it worth a god damn..
2016-04-11 15:53:09	fsociety	the show is really pretentious
2016-04-11 15:53:29	fsociety	and fred the male lead is a fucking ass hat
2016-04-11 15:53:31	sq271	portland at a whole is pretentious, but they really don't capture it..
2016-04-11 15:53:41	sq271	*as
2016-04-11 15:53:56	boobah	reves: > still happens
2016-04-11 15:54:00	boobah	reves: isn't it brand-new?
2016-04-11 15:54:01	fsociety	maybe not to a portlandian, but definetly to someone who isn't from US
2016-04-11 15:54:12	sq271	rocx: you're bot is cool, but i suck at regx, ha...
2016-04-11 15:55:36	reves	thanks boobah. i'll pm venam
2016-04-11 15:56:05	boobah	yeah, they were talking about it earlier today too
2016-04-11 15:56:45	sq271	fsociety: i forgot where you are.. i think you told me once. 
2016-04-11 15:56:58	acg	boobah, i think this is a returning podcast
2016-04-11 15:57:07	boobah	acg: ah
2016-04-11 15:57:18	boobah	acg: i just knew there was a current effort
2016-04-11 15:58:39	acg	boobah, if you look at the schedule posts those are on a second page of a 2015's thread
2016-04-11 15:59:51	boobah	acg: yep, i see that now :)
2016-04-11 16:05:00		[15:59]
2016-04-11 16:08:05	boobah	gawd, i just hate the look of multiline if/while/for conditional statements
2016-04-11 16:08:15	boobah	but i'm limiting myself to 72-ish columns
2016-04-11 16:08:17	boobah	what do?
2016-04-11 16:13:32	acg	limit yourself on everything but conditionals?
2016-04-11 16:15:02	boobah	the whole point of limiting myself is to be nice to 80x24 terminal users though
2016-04-11 16:15:34	boobah	i've tried various indenting styles for this, but everything looks terrible
2016-04-11 16:15:43	boobah	i don't think there's a good solution here
2016-04-11 16:16:19	sq271	boobah: idk, but keep up the good fight!
2016-04-11 16:17:10	boobah	yeah, i will :D
2016-04-11 16:18:30	sq271	boobah: i live in the tty, uefi is some bullshit, no one gives a shit about that, it's gross, and no one cares we even exist! haha
2016-04-11 16:18:57	acg	i ended up removing the limit on vim, sorry about 80x24s
2016-04-11 16:19:57	acg	time to get some stuff done
2016-04-11 16:19:57	boobah	i still use 80-col terms when i use floating wms :/
2016-04-11 16:20:05	acg	goodnight

2016-04-11 16:26:01	reves	venam: thanks. i guess i'll wait to hear it non-live
2016-04-11 16:26:57	sq271	boobah: no, it's a joke, the pacific northwest is some limpwristed bullshit who doesn't have a clue, and most importantly it's just not my problem..

2016-04-12 00:27:05	+fyr	no it doesn't
2016-04-12 00:27:16	+seth	I can think of another operating system missing a package manager
2016-04-12 00:27:23	+seth	it starts with Win
2016-04-12 00:27:26	+seth	ends in dows

2016-04-12 00:28:06	@xero	>"the missing package manager for OS X"
2016-04-12 00:28:10	+seth	yes
2016-04-12 00:28:12	@xero	e.g not there by default
2016-04-12 00:28:21	@xero	so that doesnt count
2016-04-12 00:28:29	+seth	so fyr is indicating that he can't *even* install a package manager
2016-04-12 00:28:32	@xero	you can use some package managers on crux
2016-04-12 00:28:37	+seth	mmm
2016-04-12 00:28:41	+seth	can you though?
2016-04-12 00:28:42	+fyr	seth, I have a package manager lol
2016-04-12 00:28:48	+seth	how many packages tho?
2016-04-12 00:28:50	+seth	20?
2016-04-12 00:28:53	+fyr	...

2016-04-12 00:29:56	+seth	aren't you compiling against musl?
2016-04-12 00:29:59	+fyr	no
2016-04-12 00:30:13	+fyr	crux isn't /that/ hipster
2016-04-12 00:30:21	+seth	it's pretty hipster
2016-04-12 00:30:32	+fyr	all I'm saying is that projects that assign blame on the user are bad projects
2016-04-12 00:30:54	+seth	:P
2016-04-12 00:31:36	+seth	what does crux get me?
2016-04-12 00:31:43	+seth	using debian / ubuntu, I get stability
2016-04-12 00:31:46	+seth	using arch I get bleeding edge
2016-04-12 00:31:57	+seth	what does crux offer that's compelling
2016-04-12 00:32:03	+fyr	>implying crux cant be bleeding edge as well
2016-04-12 00:32:06	+seth	not even trolling, genuinely asking
2016-04-12 00:32:23	+fyr	the first word that springs to mind is control
2016-04-12 00:32:25	@xero	i dont want to get flamed for this
2016-04-12 00:32:39	+fyr	okay you have /control/ on other distros
2016-04-12 00:32:42	+fyr	don't get me wrong
2016-04-12 00:33:03	@xero	but arch is like crux light. arch it's based on assumptions of what crux should have been, according to the dev team, things like systemd 
2016-04-12 00:33:22	@xero	the abs system and the aur setup is very much like how you compile on crux
2016-04-12 00:33:26	humhum	hey everyone :)
2016-04-12 00:33:32	@xero	but most arch users just install binaries
2016-04-12 00:33:47	+fyr	but they're usually hidden away or hard to access, or a package system that is overly complex for an expeirence user
2016-04-12 00:33:49	@xero	but not all, i worked w/ a guy who compiled every arch package outside of base/devl
2016-04-12 00:34:02	+fyr	agreed with xero
2016-04-12 00:34:29	+seth	systemd is pretty great
2016-04-12 00:34:31	+fyr	you can rip out arch systemd for example, but if you want to do that you might as well have installed something else
2016-04-12 00:34:53	@xero	crux gives you the freedom to create an awesome system or a pile of shit. just like arch.
2016-04-12 00:35:22	+seth	>all distros are the same
2016-04-12 00:35:27	+seth	evidenced by docker
2016-04-12 00:35:42	humhum	would just like to point out what headache systemd gave me yesterday with mpd...
2016-04-12 00:35:50	@xero	i mean, if you're talking in broad generals, yes
2016-04-12 00:36:06	+seth	humhum: implying sysv init scripts are somehow superior :P
2016-04-12 00:36:09	+fyr	systemd is great at some things
2016-04-12 00:36:17	+fyr	systemd is shit at some things
2016-04-12 00:36:18	@xero	windows, linux, osx, amigaOS, temple, gameboy, all the same
2016-04-12 00:36:22	humhum	not implying anything, i am just saying...
2016-04-12 00:36:24	+seth	kekl xero
2016-04-12 00:36:37	+seth	all electronics are the same
2016-04-12 00:36:40	tudurom	i like how the git package comes with a systemd unit for git-daemon
2016-04-12 00:37:07	tudurom	you have a "standard" way for solving problems
2016-04-12 00:37:13	tudurom	with services
2016-04-12 00:37:36	@xero	i mean, what i using a computer? bit shifting.
2016-04-12 00:37:46	@xero	hex arrays getting spliced
2016-04-12 00:37:57	@xero	it's how you choose to interact w/ that data
2016-04-12 00:38:10	+fyr	services in my mind is shit you want to run in the background
2016-04-12 00:38:11	@xero	shiny winodws with glossy title bars
2016-04-12 00:38:17	+fyr	wtf do you need a git-daemon for

2016-04-12 00:39:23	tudurom	arch is like crux, with a different set of headaches
2016-04-12 00:39:52	humhum	glad you guys mentioned windows i had something to do in my windows partition... but i can't be bothered to reboot into it...
2016-04-12 00:40:28	@xero	arch has lots of "helpers" that crux doesnt have. 
2016-04-12 00:40:39	@xero	for better or worse in many way

2016-04-12 03:21:26	@xero	i either do a single stack (like a php all over site) or a split stack between front and backend. depending on the application the front and backend are often times different (e.g. a native mobile app talking to a node api)
2016-04-12 03:22:36	@xero	in a case like that the app just asks the api for instructions, but the app itself does the things. (e.g. the app understands the api, but not the other way around. the app handles session while the api handles authentication)
2016-04-12 03:23:46	@xero	since the frontend/clientside logic can be tampered with far more easlily, i ususaly have the api do the real tasks (e.g database) and the fronend is just presentation and logic flow.

2016-04-12 08:51:57	@rocx	i think i do.

2016-04-12 08:52:13	@rocx	except for maybe the occasional dave & busters.
2016-04-12 08:52:27	@rocx	it's a lot more fun when you actually play games with friends after a few drinks.
2016-04-12 08:52:36	@rocx	stick with me, kid, and i'll keep you alive in house of the dead.
2016-04-12 08:52:43	humhum	same over here, most of the games i know from that time i played them on the pc.
2016-04-12 08:52:52	@rocx	just need to get buzzed first and i'll be the crack-shot you've dreamed of.
2016-04-12 08:53:11	@rocx	i still need to do that MAME cab.
2016-04-12 08:53:27	humhum	now i barelly game, wish i had time for it.
2016-04-12 08:53:54	@rocx	i barely game except for the old stuff because 1) i don't have a PC that can play the new stuff, both in hardware and OS
2016-04-12 08:54:00	@rocx	2) the new stuff isn't that interesting.
2016-04-12 08:54:10	@rocx	3) it's all behind DRM, whether it be steam or not.
2016-04-12 08:54:18	humhum	well what i play is old stuff as well
2016-04-12 08:54:33	humhum	was having a go at baldur's gate the other day for instance
2016-04-12 08:54:52	@rocx	i just wish it wasn't that taxing to emulate a CRT display so i could easily do a raspberry pi cab.
2016-04-12 08:55:06	@rocx	CRT cabs aren't exactly a dime a dozen anymore.

2016-04-12 08:55:29	humhum	well we either download them or use gog.com to get away from drm, other than that its becoming pretty much impossible,
2016-04-12 08:55:38	@rocx	oh you meant PC games
2016-04-12 08:55:51	@rocx	pfff. we were using windows 95 until the house fire in 2003/04.
2016-04-12 08:55:56	humhum	i meant games, not necessairly pc games
2016-04-12 08:56:10	@rocx	then winXP until 2011.
2016-04-12 08:56:22	humhum	damn...
2016-04-12 08:56:39	@rocx	but that was the family PC. i was using winXP until 2008 on a hand-me-down until it stopped working and i installed ubuntu 8.04 on it.
2016-04-12 08:56:47	humhum	i think if people put windowsxp in front of me right now, i would get lost trying to navigate it.
2016-04-12 08:56:48	@rocx	holy crap that would be eight years ago.
2016-04-12 08:57:33	humhum	i used ubuntu in 2005 for the first time i believe. can't recall.
2016-04-12 08:57:49	@rocx	wow. some ye olde linux.
2016-04-12 08:57:51	@rocx	gnome 2.
2016-04-12 08:58:11	humhum	gnome two was really good to be honest
2016-04-12 08:58:31	@rocx	nowadays i'd prefer gnome 3 if it was better under the hood.
2016-04-12 08:59:00	humhum	but yeah i just didn't know much about it i just used it
2016-04-12 08:59:05	@rocx	extendable in a sense, but without vala/gobject/ITS OWN JAVASCRIPT INTERPRETER/etc.
2016-04-12 08:59:19	humhum	it was only years later that i started to get to know linux a bit better.
2016-04-12 08:59:45	humhum	i like gnome 3 from all the "bloated" DE that's my favorite.
2016-04-12 09:00:10	sshbio	humhum: It was a simple thing, but people may want MOAR.  There is ubuntu mate in the spirit of Gnome 2 that sucks less.
2016-04-12 09:00:12	@rocx	yeah. i was using ubuntu with the gnome fallback unil 2010 or some time right after unity came out, then crunchbang in 2011.
2016-04-12 09:00:27	@rocx	sshbio: MATE's just not the same. it's based on GTK3 now i think.
2016-04-12 09:00:40	humhum	i loved crunchbang :)
2016-04-12 09:00:46	@rocx	and now i don't think i'd trust a method that i couldn't launch a program without using the keyboard.
2016-04-12 09:00:55	@rocx	even windows 7+ let you launch softwares with just the keyboard.

2016-04-12 09:04:30	@rocx	sshbio: groff.
2016-04-12 09:04:34	jmbi	i thought groff was all that
2016-04-12 09:04:37	jmbi	yea
2016-04-12 09:04:44	jmbi	troff is the barebones bell labs one

2016-04-12 09:05:04	sshbio	groff is gnu roff, and have many features and stuff.
2016-04-12 09:05:30	@rocx	sshbio: if this is going to become another GNU-bashing session, just note that there are a lot of projects that are only GNU by name.
2016-04-12 09:05:34	humhum	yeah i had never heard of groff untill now.
2016-04-12 09:05:34	sshbio	oh from bell labs! nice.  BSD have different mandoc system (and .mdoc I think)
2016-04-12 09:05:45	@rocx	sshbio: mdoc == mandoc

2016-04-12 09:07:23	jmbi	yea, lmao
2016-04-12 09:07:50	@rocx	ah. he said it's `groff -ms` in that email.
2016-04-12 09:08:29	@rocx	so it sounds like custom XML with his own tags into groff, exporting that into HTM plus print versions.
2016-04-12 09:08:35	jmbi	yep
2016-04-12 09:08:54	@rocx	jmbi: that's most definitely the unix way of thinking.
2016-04-12 09:09:07	@rocx	and he even wrote about things for troff `tbl` in The AWK Programming Language.
2016-04-12 09:09:35	@rocx	like an AWK program that'd scan some values and make macros for `tbl` for whatever troff document you pleased.
2016-04-12 09:10:35	@rocx	speaking of the devil, i need to get back working on my static page generator.

2016-04-12 09:11:31	@rocx	sshbio: i was thinking about it but then i decided to stick with markdown for when i decide to get a gopher daemon on my server.
2016-04-12 09:11:39	@rocx	i could markdown -> troff.
2016-04-12 09:13:14	sshbio	rocx: I thought about it as well.  There is ronn for that
2016-04-12 09:13:39	@rocx	think ronn's primarily for manual pages.
2016-04-12 09:14:04	sshbio	And pandoc otherwise. Oh, yes, for website that is true...
2016-04-12 09:14:40	@rocx	pandoc from the sounds of it seems to just export to `groff -man`
2016-04-12 09:14:56	sshbio	rocx: Yes, pandoc does everything!
2016-04-12 09:15:18	@rocx	was aiming for more general purpose roff into HTM rather than manual page macros.
2016-04-12 09:15:23	sshbio	If you are doing it in sh script, this could help: https://git.codemadness.org/static-site-scripts/file/README.md.html

2016-04-12 09:19:56	eldritch	my favorite thing to see in scripts is $(command | cat | other command)
2016-04-12 09:20:19	@rocx	there's the useless use of cat

2016-04-12 13:04:03	rms	rocx: the way i see it, all non-clock items in `-strftime` have to be defined at exec time
2016-04-12 13:05:00	rms	rocx: you can also use something like `cat /proc/uptime` to test, because this should be constantly updating

2016-04-12 13:09:46	rms	what would you expect those to do?
2016-04-12 13:09:57	@rocx	tab and newline.
2016-04-12 13:10:02	@rocx	as per strftime(3).
2016-04-12 13:10:24	@rocx	okay apparently %n isn't one.
2016-04-12 13:10:58	rms	oh oh
2016-04-12 13:11:11	rms	$(printf '\t') :)
2016-04-12 13:11:40	rms	so what's the verdict? it doesn't update, does it?
2016-04-12 13:11:50	@rocx	nothing's chipped at the charge yet.
2016-04-12 13:12:10	@rocx	every reading from `acpi -b` to a battery display minor mode shows 100.0%.
2016-04-12 13:12:26	@rocx	and i'm keeping that under `watc`.
2016-04-12 13:12:29	@rocx	*`watch`
2016-04-12 13:12:35	@rocx	which you might want to look into too.
2016-04-12 13:13:00	@rocx	the `watch` command.
2016-04-12 13:14:11	rms	`watch` is a funny command
2016-04-12 13:14:27	+fyr	watch is ironically useful
2016-04-12 13:14:31	+fyr	but yet still shit
2016-04-12 13:14:44	@rocx	okay no wait yeah i don't think the battery will update there.
2016-04-12 13:14:50	rms	it's basically just a fancy `while : ; do <cmd> ; sleep <interval> ; done`
2016-04-12 13:14:58	rms	with a clear(1) in there
2016-04-12 13:15:11	+fyr	it doesn't flicker tho
2016-04-12 13:15:15	@rocx	it still reports full, `acpi -b` shows discharging (but still 100%).
2016-04-12 13:15:39	@rocx	guess i'll check conky out then.
2016-04-12 13:15:54	rms	rocx: use something /other/ than battery to test this stuff :P
2016-04-12 13:16:12	rms	fyr: probably because curses
2016-04-12 13:17:09	+fyr	ya
2016-04-12 13:17:12	rms	fyr: definitely because curses
2016-04-12 13:17:18	+fyr	ya
2016-04-12 13:17:35	rms	damn it rocx i had faith in you
2016-04-12 13:18:09	@rocx	don't blame me, i had faith in xclock.
2016-04-12 13:18:27	rms	you're just not into modifying the source?
2016-04-12 13:18:35	rms	i can understand that
2016-04-12 13:18:54	@rocx	no.
2016-04-12 13:18:59	@rocx	not when i should be doing homework instead.
2016-04-12 13:19:04	rms	hahaha
2016-04-12 13:19:23	@rocx	and i'm actually doing it.
2016-04-12 13:19:35	rms	also, do you have something in mind that lemonbar isn't capable of? it's the common choice in situations like this.
2016-04-12 13:19:41	@rocx	not the usual do-anything-but-the-homework.
2016-04-12 13:19:57	@rocx	rms: conky because doesn't it write to the root window?
2016-04-12 13:20:34	rms	oh yeah conky can do that
2016-04-12 13:20:34		[13:20]
2016-04-12 13:20:41	rms	i figured you weren't since you were talking about xclock
2016-04-12 13:20:53	@rocx	xclock was sort of an experiment.
2016-04-12 13:20:59	@rocx	PISS
2016-04-12 13:21:13	+fyr	ah xclock
2016-04-12 13:21:25	rms	well cool. have fun with your homework, and keep us posted on your progress with conky.
2016-04-12 13:21:32	rms	i haven't used conky since crunchbang :)
2016-04-12 13:22:26	@rocx	dilemma: conky's writing to its own window.
2016-04-12 13:23:18	rms	rocx: `own_window no`

2016-04-12 13:30:23	@rocx	oi, the "new" syntax.
2016-04-12 13:30:25	@rocx	fyr: how come?
2016-04-12 13:30:30	+fyr	hate it
2016-04-12 13:30:36	+fyr	vile syntax
2016-04-12 13:30:53	@rocx	you seem to hate anything lua.
2016-04-12 13:31:51	@fro	what
2016-04-12 13:31:57	jmbi	lua is nice
2016-04-12 13:32:08	+fyr	lua must die
2016-04-12 13:32:13	jmbi	hmm, why
2016-04-12 13:32:16	+fyr	we demand it
2016-04-12 13:32:26	+fyr	syntax mainly
2016-04-12 13:32:39	+fyr	nearly as bad as java in my eyes
2016-04-12 13:32:50	jmbi	what is good syntax 
2016-04-12 13:32:54	+fyr	C
2016-04-12 13:33:06	@rocx	dood
2016-04-12 13:33:19	+fyr	python/ruby are okayish
2016-04-12 13:33:19	@rocx	the point of lua is as a scripting language for programs (most likely written in C).
2016-04-12 13:33:40	jmbi	lua syntax is definitely awkward though
2016-04-12 13:33:45	jmbi	and C is master race
2016-04-12 13:33:58	jmbi	but you can learn it in like 1 minute
2016-04-12 13:34:12	jmbi	so meh, i can see how it annoys you fyr 
2016-04-12 13:34:34	@rocx	besides "muh maths" and "muh tradishuns", i can't find a simple reason why stick with 1-indexed arrays.
2016-04-12 13:34:50	@rocx	just out of curiosity.
2016-04-12 13:35:10	@rocx	it's always some long-winded answer, even if it is djikstra's answer.
2016-04-12 13:35:29	+fyr	i don't care
2016-04-12 13:35:33	@rocx	granted i picked a bad time to search it five minutes before i had to go to class
2016-04-12 13:35:40	+fyr	i just think the syntax shouldn't be retarded
2016-04-12 13:35:40		[13:35]
2016-04-12 13:35:53	@rocx	fyr: how is the syntax retarded?
2016-04-12 13:35:56	@rocx	just because it doesn't do braces?
2016-04-12 13:36:03	+fyr	yes
2016-04-12 13:36:07	+fyr	also it looks ugly
2016-04-12 13:36:08	@rocx	wow 
2016-04-12 13:36:15	jmbi	this is true
2016-04-12 13:36:19	jmbi	it's pretty retarded

2016-04-12 13:38:55	@rocx	stahp saying "cuck".

2016-04-12 13:39:13	@rocx	fyr: get the crap away from the popular subreddits.
2016-04-12 13:39:32	@fro	no idea what you guys are talking about

2016-04-12 13:41:07	@rocx	/r/declutter too because face it my general vicinity is a pigsty.
2016-04-12 13:41:38	@rocx	i keep my pencils in this wooden box and next thing i know they're all out on my desk.
2016-04-12 13:41:40	@fro	so
2016-04-12 13:41:53	@rocx	so rocx is a slob?
2016-04-12 13:41:54	@fro	i never log in to reddit unless i am posting something
2016-04-12 13:41:54	@rocx	yes fro.
2016-04-12 13:41:56	@fro	which is rare
2016-04-12 13:42:03	@fro	do you guys browse while logged in?
2016-04-12 13:42:10	@fro	i find that odd
2016-04-12 13:42:10	@rocx	yeah.
2016-04-12 13:42:13	@fro	and stupid
2016-04-12 13:42:17	@fro	in terms of privacy
2016-04-12 13:42:24	@fro	i log out right after i post
2016-04-12 13:42:30	@fro	then browse
2016-04-12 13:42:31	+fyr	fro, ya
2016-04-12 13:42:39	+fyr	but seeing as I don't really give a shit
2016-04-12 13:42:59	+fyr	probably a good idea, but cba with logging in
2016-04-12 13:43:12	Dworin	Things like fb, I log in in private window, do my stuff there, log out and kill the private session.
2016-04-12 13:43:40	@fro	that doesn't do anything
2016-04-12 13:43:44	+fyr	^
2016-04-12 13:43:47	Dworin	how's that?
2016-04-12 13:43:55	@fro	you have a facebook account
2016-04-12 13:43:58	@rocx	all private browsing does is keep it secret locally.
2016-04-12 13:44:02	@fro	which is likely attached to a personal email account
2016-04-12 13:44:13	@rocx	eg. history-snoopers.
2016-04-12 13:44:14	@fro	which you are also likely using your real name, etc on
2016-04-12 13:44:18	+fyr	I deleted my fb account the other month
2016-04-12 13:44:19	@rocx	like girlfriends or nosy family.
2016-04-12 13:44:22	Dworin	it stops tracking cookies from sending my other browsing behaviour, I thought
2016-04-12 13:44:35	@rocx	Dworin: wait, you don't have cookies universally disabled?
2016-04-12 13:44:38	Dworin	My real name's not the big secret
2016-04-12 13:44:49	Dworin	delete at end-of-session only
2016-04-12 13:44:51	@fro	facebook knows what you're doing
2016-04-12 13:45:03	@rocx	fro: they can probably identify you just by lacking an account.
2016-04-12 13:45:09	Dworin	fro: yeah, I know and I don't like it
2016-04-12 13:45:29	@rocx	"hmmm, from scrounging from these other sources, this guy doesn't have an account with us. do we call him an unperson?"
2016-04-12 13:45:30	@fro	rocx: that doesn't make sense
2016-04-12 13:45:35	Dworin	but too many bands like to schedule rehearsals using fb, WA, ... I kinda need to have it
2016-04-12 13:45:36	@fro	millions of people don't have accounts
2016-04-12 13:45:50	@fro	facebook is blocked in lots of places too
2016-04-12 13:45:54	@rocx	fro: we who lack accounts don't really exist in the modern world.
2016-04-12 13:45:59	@rocx	and good, more places need to block it.
2016-04-12 13:46:06	@rocx	not on grounds of censorship though.
2016-04-12 13:46:19	@rocx	that's bad.
2016-04-12 13:46:20	Dworin	oh, blocking accounts reveals tons about you as well. I don't think fb really bothers much
2016-04-12 13:46:23	@rocx	unless it censors what i don't like.
2016-04-12 13:46:26	@rocx	something something.
2016-04-12 13:46:53	@rocx	they probably don't bother much because 99% of the people around you have a facespace account.
2016-04-12 13:47:00	Dworin	anyway. I'm always pleasantly reassured (lulled?) when these 'personalised ads' miss the mark by a mile.
2016-04-12 13:47:07	@fro	i just think it's a dumb thing to have to log into things to see content
2016-04-12 13:47:14	@fro	i can see whatever is on reddit without logging in
2016-04-12 13:47:22	@fro	same goes for google stuff
2016-04-12 13:47:29	 *	Dworin doesn't have a reddit account, even
2016-04-12 13:47:29	@rocx	fro: OOOOH MAN ESPECIALLY IF SAID THINGS ARE BEHIND A PAYWALL ACCOUNT
2016-04-12 13:47:40	@fro	yeah
2016-04-12 13:47:43	Dworin	and no google+ either. But gmail though
2016-04-12 13:47:43	@fro	ny times
2016-04-12 13:47:49	@fro	fucking annoying
2016-04-12 13:48:02	@rocx	fro: my dad does this weird thing where he bypasses that.
2016-04-12 13:48:18	@rocx	it was something really simple too. like something i probably already have taken care of.
2016-04-12 13:48:43	@fro	facebook is the worst now too
2016-04-12 13:48:51	@fro	you can't even view some business pages now
2016-04-12 13:48:52	@rocx	OOOOoo man this font suddenly sucks.
2016-04-12 13:48:59	@fro	because it has this huge fucking thing
2016-04-12 13:49:03	@fro	that says to log in
2016-04-12 13:49:10	@rocx	Prociono, 0 and o are the same glyph.
2016-04-12 13:49:11	@fro	and it covers the fucking page
2016-04-12 13:49:18	@fro	unless you block it with ublock
2016-04-12 13:49:28	Dworin	haha, lately I tried that. Some white censor-thingy slides over the page
2016-04-12 13:49:31	Dworin	well, their loss
2016-04-12 13:49:36	@fro	yeah dude
2016-04-12 13:49:39	@rocx	fro: that's why i have `policeman` to hopefully block those requests if they're behind a CDN domain and ublock to block that big warning.
2016-04-12 13:49:40	@fro	that shit is dumb
2016-04-12 13:50:08	@fro	as you scroll down it covers the whole damn page
2016-04-12 13:50:09	@rocx	mostly every site i try has assets like stylesheets behind a weird `cdn.something.com` domain.
2016-04-12 13:50:37	@rocx	if it has SVG elements, they for some reason make those things the size of the whole screen.
2016-04-12 13:50:38	@fro	and it's almost always some place that doesn't have a real website
2016-04-12 13:50:53	@rocx	fro: stack overflow has `cdnstatic`.
2016-04-12 13:50:53		[13:50]
2016-04-12 13:50:56	@fro	i realize as a business you probably want/need a facebook page
2016-04-12 13:51:00	@fro	but still
2016-04-12 13:51:00	@rocx	no wait
2016-04-12 13:51:09	@rocx	yeah i see what you mean.
2016-04-12 13:51:24	@fro	i'd be really pissed if i knew facebook was doing that
2016-04-12 13:51:41	@rocx	if i bring home a chick and she's not weirded out by the CRT monitor i'm going to get and my big black desktop, she's a keeper.

2016-04-12 13:57:45	@fro	oh yeah
2016-04-12 13:57:52	@fro	don't you have a dumb phone too?
2016-04-12 13:58:03	@rocx	android phone but i didn't get a choice in that.
2016-04-12 13:58:13	@fro	well that's probably good
2016-04-12 13:58:21	@fro	now if you meet a girl you can text her

2016-04-12 13:59:28	@fro	no one talks on the phone
2016-04-12 13:59:28	Dworin	sorry, I don't use data plan, so unless there's wifi it's old fashioned sms for me
2016-04-12 13:59:40	@fro	so you gotta text
2016-04-12 13:59:40	tA	I'd totally use a smart phone with a physical keyboard if I found one that was in Dvorak and could afford a new phone
2016-04-12 13:59:47	Dworin	but not the T( keyboard, I'm no masochist
2016-04-12 14:00:13	@rocx	tA: physical keyboards barely exist on android phones anymore, any Dvorak board in their store would cost money..
2016-04-12 14:00:33	@rocx	Dworin: T9's handy. at least i can turn it off if i need to type specifics.
2016-04-12 14:00:42	@rocx	or i can rotate it and it'll turn into a split keyboard.
2016-04-12 14:00:55	Dworin	I use hacker's keyboard. Suits my needs

2016-04-12 14:01:52	sshbio	tA: there are software keyboards with dvorak.  Maybe it is possible to change the layout of physical keyboard just if they was built-in? Otherwise, heavy hacking ahead!
2016-04-12 14:02:31	tA	sshbio, Yeah thats possible but I think if I was gonna splurge on a physical keyboard vs a really nice phone Id want it to be layed out right, which isnt gonna happen haha
2016-04-12 14:02:41	Dworin	but on a software keyboard, which is way smaller than a type writer and which is usually operated with a few fingers only, what's the point of Dvorak?
2016-04-12 14:03:03	@rocx	Dworin: good luck finding physical boards on these phones unless it's an external apparatus.
2016-04-12 14:03:06	tA	Dworin, I'm used to the l/ayout so its easier to think abxout where to look for letters
2016-04-12 14:03:11	sshbio	heh, anyway so...
2016-04-12 14:03:22	@rocx	Dworin: with T9, bigger keys.
2016-04-12 14:03:55	Dworin	true that, rocx 
2016-04-12 14:04:02	sshbio	Dworin: Alternating left and right thumbs (consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel...) maybe.
2016-04-12 14:04:27	@rocx	sshbio: workman > dvorak in my opinion.
2016-04-12 14:04:30	@rocx	it felt better.
2016-04-12 14:04:30	sshbio	And cause one already use dvorak on a real key board, as in board with keys
2016-04-12 14:04:53	sshbio	rocx: Isn't it made to be closer to the qwerty while still optimizing the keys?
2016-04-12 14:05:16	@rocx	no. it was made to optimize colemak.
2016-04-12 14:05:25	sshbio	But anyway, anything else that QWERTY, even randomly generated should be better.
2016-04-12 14:05:42	sshbio	rocx: Oh, ok I didn't know.  I'll review it again, then
2016-04-12 14:05:43	@rocx	can confirm, QWERTY gets exhausting.
2016-04-12 14:06:34	sshbio	It was made for the fingers to travel as much as possible between two strokes (to avoid typewriters to make key jams).
2016-04-12 14:06:34		[14:06]
2016-04-12 14:07:27	+fyr	 think I should make my own layout

2016-04-12 14:07:55	tA	fyr, Only if the number row has 4 - 2 - 0 in that order
2016-04-12 14:08:03	tA	on the left, and 6 - 9 on the right
2016-04-12 14:08:07	tA	For efficiency
2016-04-12 14:08:15	sshbio	fyr: A layout you will need to travel the keymap files to have them everywhere.  Or by having a programmable keyboard like the atreus

2016-04-12 16:03:52	@z3bra	and I'm working on an article atm
2016-04-12 16:04:06	@z3bra	it's just not something you get done in a few hours

2016-04-12 16:14:51	@z3bra	that's why I'm working on an article
2016-04-12 16:15:11	@z3bra	to show that things are going, and motivate people
2016-04-12 16:17:18	sshbio	z3bra: making it more real.  This would be the first content then!

2016-04-12 16:44:03	@venam	what do you think?

2016-04-12 19:14:59	mc68030	fellow nerds, learn from my mistake: don't try and boot literally any livecd on an old toshiba satellite that has a pMMX and 96MB of RAM, down that path lies madness
2016-04-12 19:14:59		[19:14]
2016-04-12 19:20:54	@venam	mc68030: what did you try booting?
2016-04-12 19:22:22	mc68030	venam: zenwalk 7 i486 (2.6.x based livecd), gparted live 0.20 i486 (4.x based livecd), now i'm trying to find a lubuntu i386 non-pae image to work with, I literally need it to pick up my network card and let me run cfdisk and then chroot into things :\
2016-04-12 19:22:48	youri	sounds like you need NetBSD
2016-04-12 19:23:17	mc68030	youri: i've never tried installing gentoo from netbsd. but i had a similar thought - "let's just boot an openbsd disc" 
2016-04-12 19:24:00	mc68030	(before anyone needs to say it, yes, I do realise how much of a horrible idea gentoo is on a machine like this) 
2016-04-12 19:26:50	@venam	gentoo from netbsd?
2016-04-12 19:27:01	@venam	what does that mean?
2016-04-12 19:27:14	mc68030	i literally need just enough something booted that i can start a gentoo install
2016-04-12 19:27:25	mc68030	that means: network, cfdisk, wget, chroot; basically
2016-04-12 19:28:01	mc68030	mainly i want to see if it's /possible/ :\

2016-04-12 20:51:17	tA	Ahaha
2016-04-12 20:51:30	@rocx	except using herbstluftwm, tiling windows, POSIX junkie, nvi for editing, etc.

2016-04-12 20:51:53	tA	Im almost there haha
2016-04-12 20:52:06	@rocx	now i use cwm for floating windows, keeping what i develop mostly POSIX, emacs for editing, and the works.
2016-04-12 20:53:01	tA	Im still on tiling, but Ive been tempted by cwm
2016-04-12 20:53:16	@rocx	it's like half of most wmutils setups done, but better

2016-04-12 20:53:34	@rocx	the other half of wmutils setups are more complex things, like tiling.
2016-04-12 20:54:20	@rocx	agh. i don't think i can go to maximize browser windows anymore

2016-04-12 21:42:45	tudurom	what game is that?
2016-04-12 21:42:52	tudurom	i should homebrew my ps2
2016-04-12 21:43:08	fsociety	tudurom, its xenosaga
2016-04-12 21:43:25	fsociety	which i guess is the spiritial sequel to xenogears and the precursor to the wii game.
2016-04-12 21:44:00	tA	fsociety: Thats fucking nice
2016-04-12 21:44:53	fsociety	ta, this game probably pushes the emulator the most.. especially from what i've read on the pcsx2 forums
2016-04-12 21:46:28	%kirby	tudurom: I've been modding my PS2's recently, pretty easy
2016-04-12 21:47:03	%kirby	Now have a 160GB harddrive almost full of games that it can run off, it's great

2016-04-12 21:48:49	%kirby	Yes, but there's a couple of conditions
2016-04-12 21:48:53	%kirby	a) Has to be a "fat" ps2
2016-04-12 21:49:00	%kirby	b) Has to be an IDE harddrive
2016-04-12 21:49:06	fsociety	kirby, that's right :)
2016-04-12 21:49:17	@venam	ah, I got the slim
2016-04-12 21:49:20	%kirby	c) You have to have one of those "PS2 network adapters", I got one off eBay for about £20
2016-04-12 21:49:39	%kirby	You can load off an SMB server as well but performance was shaky on mine
2016-04-12 21:49:47	%kirby	I have one of each and the harddrive is much nicer
2016-04-12 21:50:19	%kirby	But the SMB server came off an RPi which is by far the wrong choice for the job because of the shared usb/ethernet bus
2016-04-12 21:50:32	fsociety	i ended up giving my ps2 to my nephew, the emulator probably does 98% of my needs these days and at a higher res
2016-04-12 21:50:43	%kirby	fsociety: Did you have to use 007: Agent Under Fire?
2016-04-12 21:51:31	%kirby	I never got many PS2 games as a kid so I'm playing through all the classics with my uni housemates
2016-04-12 21:52:00	fsociety	kirby, ahh where you could hack via that game.. ;)
2016-04-12 21:52:14	%kirby	Yeah, but it was the only one I could get working
2016-04-12 21:52:29	%kirby	The hack is funny though it made me laugh
2016-04-12 21:52:54	tudurom	kirby: i have the slim
2016-04-12 21:53:09	%kirby	It can still be hacked and you can run games off an SMB server
2016-04-12 21:53:28	%kirby	Or USB but then you have to put up with those USB1.1 speeds lol
2016-04-12 21:53:53	fsociety	i did that with free mcboot
2016-04-12 21:54:34	fsociety	was a fun little project :)
2016-04-12 21:54:41	tudurom	i read free mcbot has to be installed on the memory card
2016-04-12 21:54:47	tudurom	do i need a special device for this?
2016-04-12 21:54:50	%kirby	Yeah I enjoyed doing it, taking apart the PS2 and stuff
2016-04-12 21:54:54	%kirby	No tudurom you use the PS2
2016-04-12 21:55:20	%kirby	But it saves to the memory card so you can pull it out the PS2 and the PS2 goes back to normal
2016-04-12 21:55:20		[21:55]
2016-04-12 21:55:33	tudurom	it says it doesn't work on 9xxxx slim
2016-04-12 21:55:35	tudurom	let's check
2016-04-12 21:55:57	%kirby	I think those are the really late models so you're probably fine
2016-04-12 21:56:35	tudurom	yes mine is a 7xxxx
2016-04-12 21:56:39	fsociety	i bought a few different ps2s for like $30 to play with it
2016-04-12 21:57:05	%kirby	Best guide I could find was this: http://mirrors.nkorth.com/fmcb/ps2slimfmcbguide.html
2016-04-12 21:57:12	tudurom	i found /r/ps2
2016-04-12 21:57:22	%kirby	Yeah it's in the sidebar from there
2016-04-12 21:57:32	tudurom	reddit saves the day
2016-04-12 21:58:01	fsociety	i use it mostly to play its vast jprg collection :P i also bought xenosaga 1,2 and 3 of ebay recently so i could play through all 3 legit. cant get them here in AU, so it was nice
2016-04-12 21:58:18	tudurom	does the mod work for the PAL version?
2016-04-12 21:58:25	%kirby	Yes
2016-04-12 21:58:30	%kirby	Where in the world are you tudurom?
2016-04-12 21:58:47	%kirby	I could theoretically make you a memory card and send it to you
2016-04-12 21:58:57	%kirby	It's easier than taking apart any PS2s
2016-04-12 21:59:06	tudurom	kirby: i'm in romania. i think i can do that by myself
2016-04-12 21:59:13	%kirby	Fair enough
2016-04-12 21:59:23	%kirby	But yeah mine are PAL and they're fine

2016-04-12 22:02:35	mc68030	so i thought "debian i386 has historically been solid, and their packages are usually actually compiled for generic 386"
2016-04-12 22:02:55	mc68030	"This kernel requires the following features not present on the CPU: - cmov" 
2016-04-12 22:03:19	mc68030	how the hell do you call it i386 when cmov is i686, and all the other distros call themselves i686 these days anyway? 
2016-04-12 22:03:34	%kirby	You could probably get away with using Linux if you found a replacement for the tools
2016-04-12 22:03:45	tudurom	kirby: why do i need agent under fire?
2016-04-12 22:03:53	%kirby	All you need is DVD ripping / burning and the ability to replace a file in an iso
2016-04-12 22:04:05	%kirby	tudurom: It's the only game dumb enough to load whatever code you give it
2016-04-12 22:04:46	%kirby	You also have to play the first level of Agent Under Fire which is a real treat because it sucks lol

2016-04-12 22:11:02	@rocx	think "symbola" might be what you want.
2016-04-12 22:11:11	@rocx	but you might also need to specify it as a fallback font.

2016-04-12 22:11:46	@rocx	tudurom: no.
2016-04-12 22:12:00	@rocx	things don't really accept PAL either.
2016-04-12 22:12:04	@rocx	it's strictly NTSC.
2016-04-12 22:12:09	tA	I think I have Symbola, I'll look up setting it as a fallback

2016-04-13 03:02:58	tudurom	because they have to
2016-04-13 03:03:04	@rocx	the only reason i can think of is because they have t
2016-04-13 03:03:05	@rocx	yes
2016-04-13 03:03:07	tudurom	because they are to dumb to switch
2016-04-13 03:03:16	rms	although i think a lot of actual software bugs get mixed in with human user error
2016-04-13 03:03:23	tudurom	and because they are too dumb to search for alternatives like linux
2016-04-13 03:03:25	rms	sometimes it's hard to tell
2016-04-13 03:03:27	@xero	what's funny is that from an internal design and security standpoint, win10 is a million times more superior to win7. but server was far more usable and "worked" better.
2016-04-13 03:03:27	@rocx	the bugs ARE human user error.

2016-04-13 03:03:47	@xero	they lack the desire to learn something new
2016-04-13 03:03:55	@xero	so they stick w/ the staus quo

2016-04-13 03:04:08	@rocx	or they believe the alternative is either really expensive or really strange.
2016-04-13 03:04:12	tudurom	why people don't use their computers lime their lives
2016-04-13 03:04:29	@rocx	heck, i remember people getting upser when windows xp went to vista and the start button went from green to round.

2016-04-13 03:18:53	regx	<seth> wat
2016-04-13 03:18:56	@rocx	nope.
2016-04-13 03:19:04	@rocx	that was also dumb on my prat.
2016-04-13 03:19:05	@rocx	part.
2016-04-13 03:20:15	@rocx	tudurom: man, MS is one of the big electric eyes here in the country. they could get away with a scandal like this.
2016-04-13 03:20:30	@rocx	or maybe a trial just for show to calm the paranoid.
2016-04-13 03:22:54	tudurom	a classmate thought linux is developed by a company until 3 weeks ago
2016-04-13 03:23:12	@rocx	it kind of is.
2016-04-13 03:23:14	@rocx	red hat.
2016-04-13 03:23:33	tudurom	i mean he didn't know it's made by volunteers
2016-04-13 03:23:48	tudurom	he thought a random torvalds at a random company made linux
2016-04-13 03:24:54	@xero	rocx: by at logic it's canonical as well
2016-04-13 03:25:18	@rocx	that too but they seem more focused on building on top of linux.
2016-04-13 03:25:28	@xero	fair
2016-04-13 03:25:39	tudurom	but the truth is everyone knows windows is crap and nobody gives a shit. i really don't understand
2016-04-13 03:25:39	@xero	i think redhad does have the most upstream commits to the kerne;
2016-04-13 03:26:04	tudurom	i mean if your car had a problem, you wouldn't ignore it, do you?
2016-04-13 03:26:18	@rocx	i've had people come to me for tech help just because my desktop doesn't look "normal".
2016-04-13 03:26:26	@rocx	tudurom: in my case, have to.
2016-04-13 03:26:40	tudurom	i have people to come to me for plugging a vga cable
2016-04-13 03:26:42	@rocx	"Service ABS" light on all the time, tried to get it fixed. it's a circuit problem turning on the light.
2016-04-13 03:26:50	@xero	oh
2016-04-13 03:26:54	@xero	it's intel now
2016-04-13 03:26:58	@xero	over redhat
2016-04-13 03:27:05	@rocx	i still don't trust intel.
2016-04-13 03:27:13	@rocx	with that whole stack IN THE PROCESSOR to be able to control it remotely.
2016-04-13 03:27:17	@xero	who do you trust rocx?
2016-04-13 03:27:25	tudurom	i respect them for the wonderful gpu driver
2016-04-13 03:27:42	@rocx	xero: mainly meant skeptical over don't trust.
2016-04-13 03:27:55	@xero	again, that's fair
2016-04-13 03:29:26	Shinryuu	do not even trust yourself
2016-04-13 03:29:40	@rocx	Shinryuu: tell that to my clone that has the pistol to my neck.
2016-04-13 03:29:45	Shinryuu	wait..
2016-04-13 03:30:02	+fyr	okay rms

2016-04-13 03:30:29	Shinryuu	because furries
2016-04-13 03:30:34	tudurom	you remind me of my rms fanboy teacher
2016-04-13 03:30:50	rms	just saying i've noticed some bugs that seem obvious
2016-04-13 03:30:53	rms	it surprises me
2016-04-13 03:31:12	+fyr	xero will this ever stop?
2016-04-13 03:31:17	tudurom	rms:right click on an openned program in the taskbar
2016-04-13 03:31:22	@xero	fyr: ask fro
2016-04-13 03:31:25	tudurom	right click on the taskbar then
2016-04-13 03:31:27	tudurom	see magic
2016-04-13 03:31:30	@xero	he'll frotally know
2016-04-13 03:31:40	rms	tudurom: seems to work?
2016-04-13 03:31:47	rms	tudurom: what happens on your machine?
2016-04-13 03:31:47	+fyr	I swear you have it out for us 3char people
2016-04-13 03:31:54	rms	haha
2016-04-13 03:32:00	@xero	4char mustard rice
2016-04-13 03:32:17	tudurom	rms: the tooltip should appear behind the taskbar
2016-04-13 03:32:26	Shinryuu	I do remember visiting 4chan when I was still in a middle school and I found sites like rotten out too
2016-04-13 03:32:27	+fyr	we 3chars need to stick together vs the hate of the 4char mustard rice
2016-04-13 03:32:42	rms	tudurom: what tooltip? i just get a context menu as expected.
2016-04-13 03:32:57	tudurom	7 chars have the best of both worlds: 3chars and 4chars
2016-04-13 03:33:12	@xero	7 chars are the longest i tollerate
2016-04-13 03:33:25	@xero	one more, and you're cut off
2016-04-13 03:33:32	tudurom	should switch to "tudoo"
2016-04-13 03:33:33	@xero	ask neeasad
2016-04-13 03:33:52	tudurom	tudoo is shorter
2016-04-13 03:34:05	@xero	urom
2016-04-13 03:34:09	rms	tudurom: i couldn't reproduce what you're talking about, but i found something similar
2016-04-13 03:34:37	tudurom	urom sounds so strange
2016-04-13 03:34:39	+fyr	wtf: http://pub.iotek.org/p/qbm1UYC.png
2016-04-13 03:34:41	rms	tudurom: 1. right click opened program in taskbar
2016-04-13 03:34:49	rms	tudurom: 2. right click empty part of taskbar
2016-04-13 03:35:01	@xero	fyr: what fonts?
2016-04-13 03:35:02	rms	tudurom: 3. left click anywhere else on the screen (not on the taskbar)
2016-04-13 03:35:07	+fyr	xero, lemon
2016-04-13 03:35:17	+fyr	can't access the folder either
2016-04-13 03:35:22	@xero	should have known with that "m"
2016-04-13 03:35:43	rms	fyr: what's going on with `ls -l` there?
2016-04-13 03:35:49	+fyr	rms, you tell me
2016-04-13 03:35:58	+fyr	I have no fucking idea
2016-04-13 03:36:07	rms	well, i did write ls(1)!!
2016-04-13 03:36:13	rms	fuck, i have work to do then
2016-04-13 03:36:13	+fyr	EXACTLY
2016-04-13 03:36:16	Shinryuu	UES
2016-04-13 03:36:35	rms	that's hilarious though fyr

2016-04-13 03:37:03	tudurom	mehehehe
2016-04-13 03:37:16	+fyr	literally the only anime I have on my disk too
2016-04-13 03:37:24	tudurom	i only have nichijou
2016-04-13 03:37:30	tudurom	because it's so qt
2016-04-13 03:37:33	tudurom	now cut my head
2016-04-13 03:39:14	rms	tudurom: here's another windows bug for ya (i run into this one ALL THE TIME):
2016-04-13 03:39:16	rms	tudurom:  (1) place a single image into an otherwise empty directory
2016-04-13 03:39:18	rms	tudurom:  (2) open the image in windows photo viewer or whatever it's called, the default thing
2016-04-13 03:39:20	rms	tudurom:  (3) delete the image from within windows photo viewer
2016-04-13 03:39:22	rms	tudurom:  (4) the screen will keep displaying "Loading..." like it's continuously searching

2016-04-13 03:44:16	+neeasade	regx: why you no escape slashes.
2016-04-13 03:44:18	rms	tudurom: linux too. i usually use both.

2016-04-13 03:44:44	rms	BOOM
2016-04-13 03:44:48	+neeasade	bam
2016-04-13 03:45:17	rms	tudurom: are you?
2016-04-13 03:45:41	tudurom	hell no
2016-04-13 03:45:41		[03:45]
2016-04-13 03:46:36	tudurom	i only run linux from a 128gb ssd
2016-04-13 03:46:42	tudurom	my / is 15gb
2016-04-13 03:47:07	rms	oh, bummer
2016-04-13 03:47:20	rms	i wanted you to confirm these quirks
2016-04-13 03:47:52	rms	so, what's the advantage to having separate / and /home partitions?
2016-04-13 03:48:00	rms	is it for data migration after a system upgrade?
2016-04-13 03:48:05	tudurom	when you change distros
2016-04-13 03:48:19	tudurom	you format one partition, the / one
2016-04-13 03:48:24	tudurom	the home is intact
2016-04-13 03:48:34	rms	damn, i should be doing this
2016-04-13 03:48:42	rms	i'm to used to doing a one-partition scheme
2016-04-13 03:48:54	rms	s/to/so/
2016-04-13 03:48:54	regx	<rms> i'm so used to doing a one-partition scheme
2016-04-13 03:49:06	humhum_	the all mighty rms doesn't keep separate partitions for / /home and /var :p
2016-04-13 03:49:24	tudurom	i have / /home and /boot
2016-04-13 03:49:27	tudurom	no swap
2016-04-13 03:49:29	rms	i'm not very almighty, you'll soon discover this
2016-04-13 03:49:36	tudurom	distro?
2016-04-13 03:49:41	tudurom	trisquel, aye?
2016-04-13 03:49:42	rms	void
2016-04-13 03:49:46	rms	so what's the rationale for /var
2016-04-13 03:49:50	rms	and /boot
2016-04-13 03:50:10	humhum_	i do have swap but i am inliced to let it go, it is never used...
2016-04-13 03:50:13	rms	void because i gave up on full freedom
2016-04-13 03:50:19	rms	i don't use any swap either
2016-04-13 03:50:35	+seth	read filesystem hierarchy standard defines what /var is for
2016-04-13 03:50:38	humhum_	well i don't use /var and /boot, i would use boot though, i wanted to encrypt root.
2016-04-13 03:50:39	+seth	s/read//
2016-04-13 03:50:39	regx	<seth>  filesystem hierarchy standard defines what /var is for
2016-04-13 03:50:50	rms	seth: i know what /var is for :DDD
2016-04-13 03:50:52	tudurom	i have 8gb of ram and very rarely i use more than 4
2016-04-13 03:50:59	rms	seth: i meant why have it on a separate partition
2016-04-13 03:51:13	sshbio	rms: /boot for avoiding errors on / to contaminate /boot so that the computer always boot?
2016-04-13 03:51:21	+seth	tudurom: you do without realizing, the kernel should fill it with  filesystem cache
2016-04-13 03:51:29	tudurom	off course
2016-04-13 03:51:37	tudurom	or offcourse?
2016-04-13 03:51:42	+seth	of course :P
2016-04-13 03:51:58	humhum_	seth so the kernel is still using my swap?
2016-04-13 03:52:05	+seth	not swap
2016-04-13 03:52:12	+seth	swap is additional memory mapped to disk
2016-04-13 03:52:14	+seth	so it's slow
2016-04-13 03:52:34	+seth	cache is unused memory being allocated by the kernel for non critical things 
2016-04-13 03:52:37	humhum_	yes i know, and that's why i said i probably stop using because it's always empty.
2016-04-13 03:52:53	rms	he's saying your "unused" ram is used for disk caching
2016-04-13 03:53:03	+seth	yes, do a $ free -m
2016-04-13 03:53:10	humhum_	i though you were talking about swap seth, disregard my comment.
2016-04-13 03:53:37	rms	so guys, /var
2016-04-13 03:54:10	rms	it's full of system-dependent stuff, so why isolate it?
2016-04-13 03:54:34	+seth	disk capacity used to be an issue, I don't know why you would put it on its own partition
2016-04-13 03:54:55	rms	i guess this would be a question for humhum_ then :P
2016-04-13 03:55:02	rms	since he mentioned that he does this
2016-04-13 03:55:07	+seth	I keep everything on one disk, one partition: /dev/xvda1, then I put /mnt on /dev/xvdb1
2016-04-13 03:55:14	humhum_	nope not for me i don't separate /var xD
2016-04-13 03:55:26	humhum_	good practices say you should :p
2016-04-13 03:55:31	rms	humhum_: my mistake. :)
2016-04-13 03:55:51	@xero	rms: in my setups, var is a virtual mountpoint on another machine (e.g. aws ebs volume)
2016-04-13 03:56:04	@xero	so things like /var/log can be corrilated between multiple things
2016-04-13 03:56:12	%kirby	That's a cool idea
2016-04-13 03:56:15	@xero	or hotswapped between virtual containers
2016-04-13 03:56:16	rms	that's awesome xero
2016-04-13 03:56:31	@xero	just one example
2016-04-13 03:56:36	humhum_	when i grow up i want to be like xero :)
2016-04-13 03:56:40	%kirby	My partitions always look awful because of dual boot
2016-04-13 03:56:53	%kirby	But I only have /, /home and swap on the Linux side
2016-04-13 03:56:58	@xero	kirby: i've gone 100% virtual these days
2016-04-13 03:57:07	humhum_	same over here kirby 
2016-04-13 03:57:25	humhum_	only / /home (encrypted) and /swap
2016-04-13 03:57:26	%kirby	I might just make a Windows VM
2016-04-13 03:57:39	%kirby	So tiresome reading and then it's like "damn gotta reboot now"
2016-04-13 03:57:49	rms	seth: # blkid
2016-04-13 03:57:51	rms	seth: /dev/xvda2: UUID="..." TYPE="ext4"

2016-04-13 03:58:01	%kirby	And I have a free Win10 (and all the server editions) on Dreamspark
2016-04-13 03:58:02	rms	not quite the same
2016-04-13 03:58:37	@xero	am i the only one who actually uses uefi?
2016-04-13 03:58:56	rms	my laptop is the only computer that supports it
2016-04-13 03:59:10	rms	s/\(computer\)/\1 that i own/
2016-04-13 03:59:10	regx	<rms> my laptop is the only computer that supports it
2016-04-13 03:59:11	humhum_	nope i use uefi as well...
2016-04-13 03:59:13	tudurom	well, i tried that and then i wiped everything because it wasn't booting and then i realized it was not bootable
2016-04-13 03:59:24	humhum_	it facilitates a lot of things i do with multiboot...
2016-04-13 03:59:34	tudurom	EFISTUB is really nice
2016-04-13 03:59:43	rms	xero: can you explain your virtual setup? do you host your desktop system on esxi or something?
2016-04-13 03:59:44	humhum_	but to be honest uefi is kinda of evil...
2016-04-13 04:00:21	humhum_	when oems decide they will not allow you to disable secure boot, or allow for legacy boot
2016-04-13 04:00:24	humhum_	we are fucked
2016-04-13 04:00:47	tudurom	or 32 bit uefi
2016-04-13 04:00:47		[04:00]
2016-04-13 04:00:50	tudurom	the devil
2016-04-13 04:01:09	humhum_	man 32 bit uefi is so borked that is beyond believeble...
2016-04-13 04:01:48	tudurom	you mean you don't believe in the devil?
2016-04-13 04:02:13	humhum_	but if you guys want to see borked efi firmware just try apple...
2016-04-13 04:02:30	humhum_	i cryed so much trying to figure out how it works.
2016-04-13 04:02:32	@xero	rms: not much to explain, i run other os's in virtualbox on top of my linux system. i use seemless mode to make applications "look" like they're running in linux when they're actually just in a vm. i also run lots of docker containers for services
2016-04-13 04:02:58	+neeasade	xero: hows the seemless mode been with herbstluftwm?
2016-04-13 04:03:07	@xero	humhum_: i had 0 issue settung up uefi with arch on this mac laptop for work
2016-04-13 04:03:23	@xero	neeasade: it works better w/ wmutils tbh
2016-04-13 04:03:31	tudurom	wha whaaaat
2016-04-13 04:03:32	@xero	but still pretty usable
2016-04-13 04:03:48	humhum_	its not setting it with arch :) thats the good part... its setting it with windows :)
2016-04-13 04:03:57	rms	xero: os is the host linux system /just/ a virtual system host or do you use any actual programs on it?
2016-04-13 04:04:11	tudurom	everytime i use virtualbox with wmutils i have to close an invisible window
2016-04-13 04:04:20	tudurom	the window is a bit dark
2016-04-13 04:04:25	+neeasade	xero: probably because herbstluftwm + floating windows from seamless are eeehhh?
2016-04-13 04:05:10	@xero	rms: i run arch as the host. i do 99% of my stuff on the host. i run dumb windows/mac only applications in vitualbox only when i need/have to.
2016-04-13 04:05:36	tudurom	mac?
2016-04-13 04:05:37	@xero	neeasade: exactly.
2016-04-13 04:06:01	tudurom	mac on virtualbox?
2016-04-13 04:06:08	rms	xero: i see. so you have OS X as one of your vms.
2016-04-13 04:06:12	@xero	 tudurom osx runs great in vitualbox on an actualy mac hardware
2016-04-13 04:06:15	rms	xero: didn't know you switched to herb.
2016-04-13 04:06:20	humhum_	do you use virtualbox right?
2016-04-13 04:06:23	+neeasade	rms: like almost a year ago I think
2016-04-13 04:06:43	rms	neeasade: for real? i always thought his pictures were of wmutils
2016-04-13 04:06:49	@xero	rms: i used herb for years. only recently switched to wmutils
2016-04-13 04:06:54	+neeasade	^
2016-04-13 04:07:05	@xero	awesome before that
2016-04-13 04:07:10	tudurom	i preffer bspwm to herb
2016-04-13 04:07:14	+neeasade	st w/ true colors + tmux + neovim has been a pretty okay experience
2016-04-13 04:07:30	@xero	neeasade: can we talk about st and fonts?
2016-04-13 04:07:31	+neeasade	tudurom: me too as well, but they are very similar. 
2016-04-13 04:07:34	tudurom	s/ff/f/
2016-04-13 04:07:34	regx	<tudurom> i prefer bspwm to herb
2016-04-13 04:07:40	humhum_	i started with bspwm, now i use i3
2016-04-13 04:07:40	@xero	what the fuck and i doing wrong???? everything looks like shit in shit
2016-04-13 04:07:52	+neeasade	xero: I had a little issue, but when I dicked with fontconfig options everything got pretty again
2016-04-13 04:08:08	@xero	do you use infatality or somehting for subpixel?
2016-04-13 04:08:09	tudurom	xero: you have to tweak the box sizes
2016-04-13 04:08:24	@xero	i've tried like 10 fonts now :S
2016-04-13 04:08:34	rms	xero: it "just works" for me with bitmap fonts
2016-04-13 04:08:41	+neeasade	xero: no - for me mostly I just wasn't specifying size (-<size>) on accident and I adjusted pixelsize
2016-04-13 04:09:16	rms	neeasade: so you're actually using truecolor in nvim?
2016-04-13 04:09:20	+neeasade	rms: yes
2016-04-13 04:09:28	rms	hmm
2016-04-13 04:09:58	rms	that means your vim colors aren't in sync with your st colors though
2016-04-13 04:10:01	+neeasade	I mean afaik -- spent a fair bit of time messing with that last night -- just in time, because tmux 2.2 just came out (official true color suppoprt)
2016-04-13 04:10:36	rms	"support" meaning it will properly pass the escape sequences through?
2016-04-13 04:11:06	+neeasade	yes -- if the Tc (true color) flag is set in terminfo -- but that's not a known terminfo flag so you have to set it in your tmux.conf. 
2016-04-13 04:11:15	rms	i see
2016-04-13 04:11:38	rms	my experiments with truecolor have only been by manual echo'ing
2016-04-13 04:13:03	humhum_	well got go out, catch you guys in an hour or so...

2016-04-13 04:39:55	@rocx	dcat's still delimiting with slashes.
2016-04-13 04:40:11	@xero	probably lots easier to detect
2016-04-13 04:40:40	+neeasade	delimit with whatever you want, just allow the delimiter to be escaped in replacements.
2016-04-13 04:40:58	@rocx	neeasade: that would be the point of escaping.

2016-04-13 05:09:54	@rocx	fish is also aimed to be an interactive shell.

2016-04-13 05:11:18	@rocx	boobeh.
2016-04-13 05:11:23	@xero	to use fish you need need another shell for the os to actually use
2016-04-13 05:11:25	rms	singular
2016-04-13 05:11:35	+neeasade	xero: heh, yes.
2016-04-13 05:11:35	@xero	so fish can pretty much only be an interactive shell
2016-04-13 05:11:46	rms	xero: that's fine, most of us use both mksh and dash anyway
2016-04-13 05:11:52	@rocx	xero: isn't that the goal, hence the name

2016-04-13 05:12:02	+neeasade	rms: dash as your interactive shell?
2016-04-13 05:12:08	rms	neeasade: no, as /bin/sh
2016-04-13 05:12:11	+neeasade	phew ok
2016-04-13 05:12:14	@xero	i have used dash interactivly
2016-04-13 05:12:15	rms	neeasade: for fast script execution
2016-04-13 05:12:17	@xero	it's not that bad
2016-04-13 05:12:19	@rocx	not fun.

2016-04-13 05:12:40	@xero	turns out mksh is actually a TINY BIT FASTER than dash

2016-04-13 05:12:51	rms	xero: haha, what.
2016-04-13 05:12:59	@xero	liek 0.00X faster
2016-04-13 05:13:01	+neeasade	xero: sauce pls.
2016-04-13 05:13:05	@xero	but still statistically faster

2016-04-13 05:13:29	@xero	one sec
2016-04-13 05:13:41	rms	i just like dash because if my script runs on it means it's probably reasonably portable

2016-04-13 05:15:12	rms	holy shit it actually is faster
2016-04-13 05:15:20	@xero	then run it again w/ bash, zsh, fish and cry
2016-04-13 05:15:25	rms	i just used `time mksh -c 'for i in $(/bin/seq 9999); do builtin echo foo > /dev/null; done'`
2016-04-13 05:15:28	+neeasade	bahaha
2016-04-13 05:15:53	@xero	doesnt matter what you run
2016-04-13 05:15:57	rms	right
2016-04-13 05:16:12	@xero	just strace something w/ the shells a bunch of times and average the results
2016-04-13 05:16:23	rms	is there a strict-POSIX mode?
2016-04-13 05:16:31	@xero	for what?
2016-04-13 05:16:34	rms	(or automatic if symlinked to /bin/sh?)
2016-04-13 05:16:36	rms	for mksh
2016-04-13 05:16:56	@xero	i think that's the default
2016-04-13 05:17:08	rms	i mean, with no posix extensions enabled
2016-04-13 05:17:09	+seth	I don't really think measuring the start and exit times of a shell is a fair comparison
2016-04-13 05:17:17	+seth	mksh might source more files on start than dash

2016-04-13 05:29:54	_pash	Guys i need a tip :)
2016-04-13 05:30:03	_pash	Ive been running ubuntu with i3 for a couple of months at work
2016-04-13 05:30:07	 *	rocx puts a dollar in _pash's jar.
2016-04-13 05:30:13	_pash	now i have a chance to switch to arch, which ive used a lot in the past
2016-04-13 05:30:14	rms	xero: holy crap, this site is so much nicer than lists.suckless.org
2016-04-13 05:30:23	_pash	rocx: :D
2016-04-13 05:30:31	@rocx	you said you needed a tip.
2016-04-13 05:30:45	_pash	question, should i bother/
2016-04-13 05:30:58	@xero	depends on use case
2016-04-13 05:31:01	@rocx	iunno. arch things tend to break from time to time over updates.
2016-04-13 05:31:08	rms	> Yes,  Python with less batteries, compilation, scripting and better piping support should be ideal
2016-04-13 05:31:11	@xero	is ubuntu not cutting it for you?
2016-04-13 05:31:11	rms	i like this idea
2016-04-13 05:31:16	+fyr	_pash, use crux! /s
2016-04-13 05:31:18	_pash	What annoyed me about arch before, is that things did break, like one day i upgraded and the trackpad didnt work.. so on
2016-04-13 05:31:19	@rocx	rms: so almost like AWK?
2016-04-13 05:31:30	rms	rocx: uhhhhhhhhhhh
2016-04-13 05:31:41	rms	rocx: i hope not. an awk shell would be ... awkward
2016-04-13 05:31:57	+fyr	honestly if its not your machine and you want binaries use debian
2016-04-13 05:31:57	@xero	_pash: i run arch at work. i get to work 15 mins early to update, and roll back broken packages if necessary. that's just the arch life.
2016-04-13 05:32:03	_pash	xero: thats the thing ubuntu is doing everything perfectly, although i always had an arch drool and wanted to lean all of the insides
2016-04-13 05:32:08	@xero	in 2 years i've rolled back 2 packages
2016-04-13 05:32:12	@xero	and one kernel
2016-04-13 05:32:36	 *	xero knocks on wood
2016-04-13 05:33:04	_pash	thats also something i never understood, you roll back and then do you just stick to that version or do you ever try fixing it?
2016-04-13 05:33:09	rms	xero: on arch?
2016-04-13 05:33:26	+fyr	rollback is such a retarded concept though
2016-04-13 05:33:28	rms	xero: obviously oops
2016-04-13 05:33:28	@xero	_pash: i just blacklist that broken version
2016-04-13 05:33:38	@xero	next time it updates i try the newer one
2016-04-13 05:33:48	+fyr	what's better is that you 'lock' a package and then the upgrade system ignores it
2016-04-13 05:34:06	@xero	fyr: but that's not what i want. i just dont want *that* version
2016-04-13 05:34:20	@xero	usually i'm not the only one w/ an issue w/ a broken package
2016-04-13 05:34:32	@xero	ususaly there's an update (like i minor version) the next day or so
2016-04-13 05:35:11	 *	fyr shrugs
2016-04-13 05:35:59	_pash	xero: this? https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/downgrading_packages#Return_to_an_earlier_package_version
2016-04-13 05:36:18	@xero	yup
2016-04-13 05:37:25	_pash	but in IgnorePkg you cant specify a version to ignore?
2016-04-13 05:39:03	_pash	is there anything you guys could suggest to try instead of i3?

2016-04-13 05:44:16	humhum_	any other way of getting copy and paste working with urxvt 9.20?
2016-04-13 05:46:01	humhum_	i'd love to use urxvt, but without having the ability to copy and paste correctly it's going to be hard to use it...

2016-04-13 05:48:00	humhum_	yeah the wether is going to shit everywhere.
2016-04-13 05:48:15	@rocx	that's the biggest reason i hate the summer.
2016-04-13 05:48:37	@rocx	in winter, it was nice, cold, you could bundle up, it didn't really storm, lots of clear days...

2016-04-13 06:44:35	%kirby	Fine when it works
2016-04-13 06:44:54	%kirby	But it keeps cutting randomly and the fix is to pick up the phone and listen to the dial tone
2016-04-13 06:45:18	rms	most routes to servers aren't that fast, so i could cut the throughput in half and it wouldn't really matter except for p2p

2016-04-13 07:14:57	rms	kirby: exactly this.
2016-04-13 07:15:16	%kirby	The only other site I use it for is my own where I implemented the same system
2016-04-13 07:15:30	rms	kirby: and for my classes that don't use that, i have a jump host setup on my student httpd
2016-04-13 07:15:31	%kirby	But that isn't indexed by Google so my friends have to use it haha
2016-04-13 07:16:10	rms	kirby: i misused "jump host" there but you get the idea
