2016-04-07 17:12:38	DanielMartin	I joined that, what is your username on there?
2016-04-07 17:12:43	fsociety	anon
2016-04-07 17:13:15	DanielMartin	The box is going well - that plus torrents on the NAS seem to have solved most problems. Had to add another drive to the NAS to keep up though
2016-04-07 17:13:27	DanielMartin	Oh, I think I said hi to you one day :p
2016-04-07 17:13:52	fsociety	haha i probably wasn't there

2016-04-07 17:14:37	fsociety	sorry for the lack of spaces, lag from tethering to my phone and being on the train
2016-04-07 17:16:43	DanielMartin	Hehe all good - I can figure it out :p
2016-04-07 17:16:54	DanielMartin	What happened to your OS? Or just time for a rebuild?
2016-04-07 17:17:04	fsociety	i spent the other week playing ps1, segacd and psp games on that minix box
2016-04-07 17:17:23	fsociety	oh i was compiling software between two different versions of gcc and things started to break and not build
2016-04-07 17:17:28	fsociety	so i decided it was time for a rebuild
2016-04-07 17:22:18	DanielMartin	Hehe ahh dear, the joys of tinkering
