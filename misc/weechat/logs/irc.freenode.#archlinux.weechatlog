2016-04-06 12:17:19	krarkrrrc	should i be editing the root version?
2016-04-06 12:17:32	raphael1	nope, yo usohuld be using your /home/.xinitrc
2016-04-06 12:17:39	DigitalKiwi	can we respond with a triple negative so you're as confused by our answer as we are your question?

2016-04-06 12:19:31	raphael1	I think this will solve the problem. My theory is since you didn't background the xrdb -merge job, it starts again and undoes itself when you reload i3 manually
2016-04-06 12:19:43	raphael1	Nah, just add the &s

2016-04-06 15:12:50	|aaron	Anyway, kglobalaccel until very recently *also* did not die when receiving SIGTERM due to trying to catch the signal and not doing it properly, thus getting stuck. Because catching signals properly isn't trivial and really not necessary, I've removed that part.

2016-04-06 15:21:25	|aaron	ah right that makes sense
2016-04-06 15:21:42	|aaron	everything i read suggests opening up a different TTY while its shutting down and checking which processes are still open
2016-04-06 15:21:55	|aaron	but i just g et a blank screen when i switch TTYs at this point

2016-04-06 15:30:32	sheep	the message during shutdown (or stopping jobs) needs to be more verbose though and say what jobs are waiting to stop
2016-04-06 15:31:01	honestly	sheep: it always says the user scope is hanging which is completely useless.
2016-04-06 15:31:26	sheep	technically it is the user session hanging.  it's a separate process not part of the master process
2016-04-06 15:31:38	sheep	but it should have its own output for the user units waiting too

2016-04-06 15:32:35	honestly	systemctl stop vthe user scope' works flawlessly and instantaneously and then leys you shutdown without issie btw so it's probably not judt a program in the user scope hanging.

2016-04-06 15:38:43	honestly	You need to get the output of "systemctl status 'the user scope'" while it's hanging in during shutdown to see what's hypothetically hanging inside it
2016-04-06 15:38:56	honestly	I sure haven't managed to do that

2016-04-06 15:40:33	Hwkiller	sheep: it's not in the journal
2016-04-06 15:40:41	Hwkiller	I just checked
2016-04-06 15:40:43	Hwkiller	nothing.
2016-04-06 15:40:43	honestly	There is nothing of value in the user normal except that the scope was hanging
2016-04-06 15:41:05	honestly	Which you already know from looking at the screen during shutdown
2016-04-06 15:41:16	sheep	in |aaron's case it was implied that dbus.service was what had to be killed in the user journal
2016-04-06 15:41:17	honestly	User journal*
2016-04-06 15:41:28	Hwkiller	honestly: mine doesn't even have /that/
2016-04-06 15:41:32	|aaron	yeah theres literally nothing. there is a 90 second gap between my pulseaudio service being successfully stopped and tjhen "dbus.service: State 'stop-final-sigterm' timed out. Killing"
2016-04-06 15:41:39	sheep	it doesn't say "dbus.service is handing" it does what |aaron just said
2016-04-06 15:41:58	Hwkiller	my journal is void of anything hanging
2016-04-06 15:42:03	|aaron	except on the console is says "dbus stopped" on the line asbove
2016-04-06 15:42:04	Hwkiller	even though I saw the damn thing hanging
2016-04-06 15:42:05	sheep	separate /var?

2016-04-06 15:43:23	sheep	this sounds like it's absolutely deserving of a feature request in systemd 
2016-04-06 15:43:37	|aaron	god i hate systemd so much :(

2016-04-06 15:44:17	sheep	Hwkiller: FEATURE: actually show what stop jobs are currently waiting for user sessions and put a message in the logs indicating what jobs were hanging when the timeout was reached
2016-04-06 15:44:21	Hwkiller	but, to be fair, I had bootup/shutdown issues occasionally on the old rc system.
2016-04-06 15:44:33	sheep	also provide an interactive option to halt systemd's shutdown process (or startup) and inspect the state

2016-04-06 15:45:18	honestly	sheep: That sure would be helpful.
2016-04-06 15:45:23	Hwkiller	why is it hard to find the waiting process?
2016-04-06 15:45:29	sheep	because systemd still has to respond to events like main processes in services moving from the starting state to active
2016-04-06 15:45:33	fs0ciety	i did swap from systemd to openrc on arch and that usually resolved all of my systemd woes
2016-04-06 15:45:38	sheep	if you mean the second one
2016-04-06 15:45:54	|aaron	fs0ciety: yeah it sounds like thats our only solution
2016-04-06 15:46:02	fs0ciety	i had the same hanging problem as well
2016-04-06 15:46:02	sheep	just printing out what units are currently waiting for shutdown when it's waiting for stop jobs (and having the user session do the same) shouldn't be that hard
2016-04-06 15:46:10	honestly	Just log all still existing processes in the scope every ten seconds.
2016-04-06 15:46:16	honestly	Bam done.
2016-04-06 15:46:20	Hwkiller	sheep: that alone would make me happy
2016-04-06 15:46:20	sheep	that would fill up the logs a lot

2016-04-06 15:46:29	sheep	Hwkiller: file an issue on github
2016-04-06 15:46:39	Hwkiller	apparently there's already an issue on github

2016-04-06 15:46:50	|aaron	hwkiller: yeah same. could either fix it or file a bug report in the right place
2016-04-06 15:47:05	sheep	as someone who has had to write UI, knowing what it's supposed to look like really makes it a lot easier to know what information it needs to show
2016-04-06 15:47:06	honestly	sheep: Don't be ridiculous.
2016-04-06 15:47:07	|aaron	yeah i found tons of issues on github related to this

2016-04-06 15:47:56	sheep	it's not rediculous
2016-04-06 15:48:07	fs0ciety	lennart is probably like pfft.. users
2016-04-06 15:48:30	honestly	There are approximately zero processes justified to all be running 10 seconds after they were told to clean up and exit.
2016-04-06 15:48:33	sheep	the interactive debug thing would be massively hard to do
2016-04-06 15:48:42	sheep	uh

2016-04-07 17:51:09	Strout	localhost is just a subdomain and localdomain is the actual domain, e.g I have several computers in my home.

2016-04-07 17:51:59	Strout	so if I want to change the domainname should I only do it within /etc/hosts?

2016-04-08 22:37:31	cdidd	I have another question. So if there is no tracking of installed status for meta packages, what happens when a package becomes deprecated, renamed, or incorporated into another packages. In other distors, you can, install a virual package, and rely on that for chaniging package set. What happens in Arch?
2016-04-08 22:37:40	cdidd	You just get a stale package?

I have a feeling though, it has something to do with hardware settings, or something I'm missing :( Would I have better results if I try booting from the micro sd instead of the usb? or is that even possible?

I'm using lastpass, but not very happy with it, I dislike that it is closed-source and so well-known (so prone to attacks) and that they can't possibly disclose an attack because their business relies on security, so I can't count on them being straight about it.

2016-04-09 02:29:17	stochastix	For anyone who is good at regular expressions,  is it possible to match  ??12l   or  ?1;32r   at the same time?  I can do them separately but was wondering if there is a way to combine them. Or is it just better to call sed twice or more for fairly different matches?  Also, is there a way in one sed command to search for  this, or this, or this  ?
2016-04-09 02:29:20	Halfwit	xananax: It came about honestly, do understand it's meant to help, not impose.

2016-04-09 05:47:07	demonicmaniac3	amdgpu you do need to enable experimental support though

2016-04-09 05:47:43	L0g4nAd4ms	so AMDGPU will be better since its updated frequently 
2016-04-09 05:47:53	Mion	so, you will be using amdgpu no matter if you use the closed source amd driver or the free driver

2016-04-09 05:48:08	demonicmaniac3	L0g4nAd4ms: basically radeon is deadn and amdgpu is where it's at for everything gcn
2016-04-09 05:48:21	Strout	Is there a bettter Unicode font with symbols like '❯', currently on Archlinux this is rendered as Bitmap. I believe on my OSX it is rendered as SVG.

2016-04-09 05:48:28	demonicmaniac3	and amdgpu is joint development of open source and "proprietary" devs

2016-04-09 09:12:36	AiShield	NYTimes, I mean they can't validate it so why not. Only an issue really if you pay with a CC or some other payment form that requies an address
2016-04-09 09:12:47	ironkai	MacGyver: "# echo 1 > rom" is giving me permission denied, even with sudo. Any ideas?
2016-04-09 09:12:47	Accession	sheep: I would just rather request it be added (obviously if denied due to some catastrophic reason that's fine) to the package, rather than adding the patch myself, especially with something like coreutils.
2016-04-09 09:13:10	AiShield	NYTimes, I know digital ocean is pretty strict about that, IME they won't even let you use a paypal account that doesn't have a validadted CC
2016-04-09 09:13:13	sheep	Accession: if it fixes an actual issue, coreutils's devs will add it
2016-04-09 09:13:15	MacGyver	ironkai: Does your user have write permissions to the directory you're trying to write the ROM to?
2016-04-09 09:13:16	AiShield	NYTimes, Maybe just USA problems tho
2016-04-09 09:13:16	NYTimes	AiShield: so do I pay like with bitcoins ?

2016-04-09 09:13:47	sheep	Accession: it's possible that coreutils already has the change, but fedora had to take it from a newer version and patch it into an older version because they need to support an older version.  that's just a gues though
2016-04-09 09:14:04	AiShield	NYTimes, yea if you can find a VPS dealer that accepts them. I know there are a few, but don't know OF any.

2016-04-09 09:15:02	Accession	sheep: that's possible. and like you said, I just googled and found a simliar -2 patch of the same name, which apparantly has bugs according to the LFS people. So.. maybe it's just too new at the moment.

2016-04-09 09:16:59	ironkai	Anywhere to sell 2nd hand parts? :P
2016-04-09 09:17:15	Mion	ebay
2016-04-09 09:17:25	AiShield	ebay but I think you might be seeking a better answer
2016-04-09 09:17:28	Sapphirus	craigslist or your local classified
2016-04-09 09:17:40	ironkai	I live in Turkey. The second hand market isn't that great here.
2016-04-09 09:17:45	Mion	your local lug/hackerspace
2016-04-09 09:17:51	Sapphirus	ebay might be your best bet
2016-04-09 09:17:55		distortedvoice is now known as distortedvoice_
2016-04-09 09:17:58	MacGyver	AiShield: Asrock extreme6/3.1 based on the x99 chipset (not recommendable though, I'm having boot issues with it which I haven't resolved yet); Intel i7 5820k; 32GiB DDR4; AMD Radeon R9 390.
2016-04-09 09:18:05	Mion	just sell to the deash then
2016-04-09 09:18:17	MacGyver	AiShield: And a cheap-ass old radeon for the host.
2016-04-09 09:18:27	Mion	MacGyver: asrock generally are buggy as heck
2016-04-09 09:18:35	Mion	both hardware and firmware wise
2016-04-09 09:18:48	Sapphirus	there's a reason you never cheap out on the mobo unless you're really that dry on cash
2016-04-09 09:18:49	AiShield	MacGyver, I went AMD FX 8320, Gigabyte 990x, and a Sapphire 390x
2016-04-09 09:18:50	MacGyver	Mion: Once it's booted it runs like a charm though.
2016-04-09 09:18:51	Mion	they have had some "interesting" designs though
2016-04-09 09:18:54	Sapphirus	same goes with psu
2016-04-09 09:19:00	MacGyver	Sapphirus: I *didn't* cheap out on the mobo.
2016-04-09 09:19:01	Mion	like cards with support for both ddr and ddr2
2016-04-09 09:19:04	Sapphirus	asrock tho
2016-04-09 09:19:10	Sapphirus	asrock are cheap in comparison to other brands
2016-04-09 09:19:18	Mion	or two different cpu sockets
2016-04-09 09:19:19	Sapphirus	thus lower quality
2016-04-09 09:19:20	MacGyver	Sapphirus: I went for a board with official support for what I wanted, Asus didn't have that.
2016-04-09 09:19:23	Mion	Sapphirus: not by much
2016-04-09 09:19:28	AiShield	MacGyver, I tried to do it on skylake for my friend and struck out, but that was when skylake was a new and VFIO isn't the thing to do over VNC as I've learned
2016-04-09 09:19:29	Mion	in regards to the price
2016-04-09 09:19:48	Mion	in some cases they are actually more expensive
2016-04-09 09:20:16	AiShield	MacGyver, do you get the purported "near native
2016-04-09 09:20:17	ironkai	Well, it seems I can salvage $400 out of my 2600k, 560 and the motherboard.
2016-04-09 09:20:22	MacGyver	AiShield: Hmm.
2016-04-09 09:20:28	MacGyver	AiShield: Benchmarking this is hard.
2016-04-09 09:20:35	MacGyver	AiShield: I can run battlefield 4 on ultra settings.
2016-04-09 09:20:37	Sapphirus	how much would I be able to sell a i7 4790k & z97 motherboard for?

2016-04-09 09:20:56	Mion	depends on how scroupeless you are
2016-04-09 09:21:00	MacGyver	AiShield: I'd say it's near-native-enough.
2016-04-09 09:21:06	Mion	if you are a compelte asshole: 120% of new price
2016-04-09 09:21:17	Mion	if just a normal asshole: 80% of new price
2016-04-09 09:21:18	Sapphirus	I could do that since the cad is shit
2016-04-09 09:21:34	Mion	a realistic price is about 1/2 of newprice
2016-04-09 09:21:37	AiShield	MacGyver, I give it 4/8, but I have some issues with mine, missing performance and such but a lot of it is win10 hogging the cpu with system and compressed memory and other random processes
2016-04-09 09:21:39	Sapphirus	Paid less for it new at the store than what it retails for now
2016-04-09 09:21:40	Mion	at most
2016-04-09 09:21:43	MacGyver	AiShield: The problem with benchmarking it is that benchmark programs have no friggin' clue what they're dealing with.
2016-04-09 09:21:49	AiShield	MacGyver, IKR
2016-04-09 09:21:54	Sapphirus	So I could list it at the old retail price in CAD and ppl would likely buy it

2016-04-09 09:22:12	MacGyver	AiShield: Especially if you're running any kind of disk encryption.
2016-04-09 09:22:28	Mion	Sapphirus: the current price of 4xxx serie stuff is not realistic since it is discontinued really
2016-04-09 09:22:33	AiShield	MacGyver, No FDE but what other tweaks do you recommend
2016-04-09 09:22:37	ironkai	Since I'll be starting from scratch with a new machine, do you think it's worth going Skylake, since selling my ram doesn't seem as extreme now.
2016-04-09 09:22:46	Sapphirus	Mion still being sold by retailers
2016-04-09 09:22:46	MacGyver	AiShield: I mean to tune down vm.dirty_ratio/bytes and vm.dirty_background_ratio/bytes.
2016-04-09 09:22:54	Sapphirus	so i wouldn't go as far as saying that yet
2016-04-09 09:23:05	Sapphirus	I could probably get a way with $350-$360 CAD for the CPU
2016-04-09 09:23:05	Mion	Sapphirus: also some morons thinks that the 4xxx serie is somehow magic and therefor drive up the used market price of them
2016-04-09 09:23:09	Mion	Sapphirus: old stock

2016-04-09 09:27:58	AiShield	MacGyver, Ah ok
2016-04-09 09:28:22	MacGyver	AiShield: It's to do with how much data to be written to disk is cached before the write process starts.

2016-04-09 09:47:52	Mion	also if you don't print for two weeks they will be clogged :p

For example if I'm listening to music through Clementine on linux, and try to start a WINE application that uses audio it'll be mute. But if I close clementine and then restart the wine app audio will work.

Got the program to work after deleting the config file (man, I love strace...) ... but when I set the setting to use qtkeychain, I get <https://ptpb.pw/wE6b>.  Seems like it was not compiled with the relevant flag set, or a lib version mismatch?  This is too critical of a

2016-04-09 18:00:05	sheep	kinda
2016-04-09 18:00:15	sheep	it converts the calls to windows libraries

2016-04-09 18:01:11	sheep	mostly older games from the windows 95 era and a couple modern applications
2016-04-09 18:01:19	sheep	sometimes it's faster
2016-04-09 18:01:41	jushur	fishbulb: there is some extra code for Wine that can run games in Direct3D/DirectX mode. cant realy advice on anything related to Wine anymore tho. As i stoped using it several years ago.

2016-04-09 18:01:59	sheep	there is some slight overhead for having to convert data between what the Windows APIs expect and what the native APIs expect

2016-04-09 18:02:28	fishbulb	and probably lower than the windows overhead
2016-04-09 18:02:37	demonicmaniac3	at least nowadays with mt patches
2016-04-09 18:02:41	sheep	possibly higher
2016-04-09 18:02:44	demonicmaniac3	before mt times performance was quite horrific
2016-04-09 18:02:55	fishbulb	what does mt stand for?

2016-04-09 18:03:13	fishbulb	Oh. yeah there are many threads in these machines
2016-04-09 18:03:14	sheep	it also depends on what the API is.  converting Windows OpenGL stuff to GLX is trivial

2016-04-09 18:04:11	jushur	a thing to consider is the fact that running games in Wine will open you up to some possibly nasty exploit cenarios. heavily dependant on what you run in Wine.
2016-04-09 18:04:28	sheep	it depends on whether the exploit is exploitable in wine
2016-04-09 18:04:47	fishbulb	I'm not interested in games so much
2016-04-09 18:04:58	fishbulb	or at all, I'd just run those in windows
2016-04-09 18:05:00	sheep	obviously an exploit in an NT kernel service won't affect wine since it doesn't contain the NT kernel

2016-04-09 18:06:16	sheep	if the exploit is in the application itself, then it's an issue
2016-04-09 18:06:22	jushur	basicly giving the remote 100% access to anything you have in your access as current running user.
2016-04-09 18:06:33	sheep	well, wine does have some containment
2016-04-09 18:06:41	sheep	not sure how good it is though
2016-04-09 18:06:48	fishbulb	for that matter how do I see what has access right now
2016-04-09 18:06:53	demonicmaniac3	and how is that different from any other application you run as your user?
2016-04-09 18:07:15	sheep	anything running under your user account has access to the same privileges your user account has
2016-04-09 18:07:35	sheep	more or less
2016-04-09 18:07:38	demonicmaniac3	you could argue that that is a problem facing any and all proprietary applications you run as your user

2016-04-09 18:08:01	jushur	the big difference is that almost all applications for ms win has some issues, mostly due to relying on things that are tighlty tied into the system.
2016-04-09 18:08:19	fishbulb	usb access?
2016-04-09 18:08:27	demonicmaniac3	and again nt kernel font drawing does not happen in wine

2016-04-09 18:09:04	sheep	or issues in services running with supervisor privileges
2016-04-09 18:09:07	fishbulb	windows has a kernel?

2016-04-09 18:09:43	sheep	windows uses a hybrid kernel model though, so some of the stuff that runs in kernel mode isn't part of the kernel
2016-04-09 18:09:52	demonicmaniac3	and only give him access to your game directory/win software

2016-04-09 18:11:48	demonicmaniac3	so it would be a bug in a library call from within wine that can be exploited to gain root priviledges then
2016-04-09 18:12:27	demonicmaniac3	unless morons run wine as root but then they should get shot anyways
2016-04-09 18:12:48	fishbulb	the point is to safely contain the windows program I assume
2016-04-09 18:13:27	sheep	in that case your best option is to run wine on a separate account without the ability to sudo or su to root

2016-04-09 19:36:23	mkoskar	Strout: I think the fact that it is symlinked is irrelevant, though where does it point to might be valid concern generally. Is it same filesystem? Would it be mounted in time when it is used?

2016-04-09 19:38:07	Strout	mkoskar, instead of symlinking should I "install" them?
2016-04-09 19:38:14	thevishy	it should be big enough for textwidth=79 in vim and legible, so I think 10 is the magic number on 13" laptops

2016-04-09 19:39:56	amcrae	bibek22: by getting the url from the pkgbuild

2016-04-09 19:40:04	thevishy	I guess I will stick to 10 then for monospaced fonts, mostly have been using 9 which looked a bit small
